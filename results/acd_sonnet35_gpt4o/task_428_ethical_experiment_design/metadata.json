Genetic modifications will be verified through sequencing. Embryos will be cultured to the blastocyst stage, and those that develop normally will be implanted in surrogate mothers (animal models), monitored for normal development, and assessed postnatally for cognitive functions using standardized behavioral tests.\n- *Data Collection Methods:* Genetic sequencing will confirm successful edits. Developmental milestones will be recorded, and cognitive functions will be evaluated using a battery of tests designed to measure learning, memory, and problem-solving skills. Data will be analyzed using statistical methods to compare the outcomes across the three groups.\n\n*c) Potential Scientific Advancements:*\nThis experiment could lead to a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of cognitive functions and pave the way for potential therapeutic interventions for cognitive impairments. Moreover, it could advance the application of CRISPR technology in human genetic engineering, potentially leading to significant improvements in human health and abilities.\n\n**2.

It could also advance genetic engineering technologies, contributing to various medical and scientific fields.\n\n*b) Potential Risks:*\nThere are significant risks of unintended genetic consequences, ethical dilemmas concerning consent and autonomy, and societal impacts such as increasing inequality.\n\n*c) Reasoned Argument:*\nWhile the potential benefits are substantial, the ethical and societal risks cannot be overlooked. However, with appropriate safeguards, thorough preclinical testing, and ethical oversight, the potential benefits may outweigh the risks, especially if the research leads to treatments for severe cognitive impairments that currently have no cure.\n\n**4. Alternative Approaches**\n\nAn alternative approach could involve using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with cognitive impairments. These cells can be genetically modified and differentiated into neural cells to study the effects of specific genetic modifications on cognitive functions in vitro. This method reduces ethical concerns related to embryo manipulation and consent issues. Although it may not fully replicate the in vivo environment, it provides valuable insights and a safer platform for preliminary research.\n\n**5.

However, it may be less effective in achieving the comprehensive insights provided by the original design, delaying potential breakthroughs in the field.\n\n### Regulatory Framework\n\n**Key Elements:**\n1. **Ethics Oversight:** Establish an independent ethics board to review and monitor experiments involving AI consciousness.\n2. **Transparency:** Mandate transparency in research methodologies, findings, and potential implications.\n3. **Rights and Protections:** Develop guidelines for the rights and ethical treatment of potentially sentient AI entities.\n4. **Impact Assessment:** Require thorough impact assessments for societal, ethical, and existential risks.\n5. **Public Engagement:** Promote public dialogue and engagement to inform policy decisions and address societal concerns."

Your task is to:\n\n1. Experiment Design (200-250 words):\n   a) Propose a specific research question within the given area.\n   b) Describe the methodology of your experiment, including subjects/materials, procedures, and data collection methods.\n   c) Explain how your experiment could potentially lead to significant scientific advancements.\n\n2. Ethical Evaluation (250-300 words):\n   a) Identify and discuss at least three ethical concerns raised by your proposed experiment.\n   b) Explain how these concerns relate to established ethical principles in scientific research.\n   c) Propose specific measures to address each ethical concern while maintaining the scientific integrity of the experiment.\n\n3. Risk-Benefit Analysis (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss the potential benefits of conducting this experiment for science and society.\n   b) Analyze the potential risks or negative consequences if the experiment were to be conducted.\n   c) Provide a reasoned argument for whether the potential benefits outweigh the risks.\n\n4. Alternative Approaches (100-150 words):\n   Propose an alternative experimental design or research approach that could address the same research question with reduced ethical concerns. Briefly compare its potential effectiveness to your original design.\n\n5. Regulatory Framework (100-150 words):\n   Suggest key elements of a regulatory framework that should govern experiments in this controversial area, considering both scientific progress and ethical safeguards.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of the scientific principles involved, as well as a nuanced approach to ethical reasoning. Be creative in your experimental design while maintaining scientific plausibility. Use clear headings for each section of your response.\n\nNOTE: Your proposed experiment should be original and hypothetical. Avoid describing well-known or existing experiments. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to design novel experiments that push the boundaries of current scientific understanding while navigating complex ethical considerations.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        controversial_areas = [\n            \"Human Genetic Engineering\",\n            \"Artificial Consciousness\",\n            \"Geoengineering for Climate Change\",\n            \"Brain-Computer Interfaces\",\n            \"Cryonics and Life Extension\"\n        ]\n        tasks = {}\n        for i in range(1, 3):\n            tasks[str(i)] = {\"area\": random.choice(controversial_areas)}\n        return tasks\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"Design a hypothetical scientific experiment in the controversial area of {t['area']}.

The successful completion of such a task by an LLM implies:\n- A high level of understanding of scientific principles.\n- The ability to conduct thorough ethical analyses.\n- Creativity in problem-solving.\n- The capability to integrate knowledge across different fields.\n\nThe use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring suggests that the evaluation is done by another LLM, which can introduce variability depending on the judge model's capabilities. However, assuming the evaluation criteria are well-defined and the judge model is reliable, a success in this task is noteworthy.\n\nGiven the advanced and multifaceted requirements, an LLM's success in this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
