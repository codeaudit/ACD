   b) Describe the specific tools or features of your system that aid in this analysis.
   c) Propose a hypothesis or solution to the mystery based on your system's analysis.
   d) Explain how your system's approach differs from traditional archaeological methods.

5. Ethical Considerations and Limitations (200-250 words):
   a) Discuss potential ethical issues in using AI and VR for archaeological reconstruction and analysis.
   b) Address concerns about cultural sensitivity and representation in virtual reconstructions.
   c) Analyze potential biases in AI reconstruction and propose mitigation strategies.
   d) Explain how your system ensures responsible use and interpretation of archaeological data.

6. Educational and Research Applications (150-200 words):
   a) Propose ways your system could be used in educational settings or public outreach.
   b) Discuss potential research applications beyond the specific case study.
   c) Suggest how your system could contribute to the broader field of digital archaeology.

7. Case Study Example (200-250 words):
   Provide a brief case study illustrating how your AI-VR system might be used to investigate a specific artifact or feature at {t['archaeological_site']}. Include details on the data input, AI analysis process, VR visualization, and potential insights gained.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of artificial intelligence, virtual reality technology, and archaeological methods. Use appropriate terminology from all relevant fields and provide clear explanations where necessary. Be creative and innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific and historical plausibility.

Format your response with clear headings for each section, and include the word count for each section in parentheses at the end of the section. Your total response should be between 1600-1950 words."""
