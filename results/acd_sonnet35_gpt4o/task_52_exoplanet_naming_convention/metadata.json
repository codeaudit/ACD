Find a narcissistic number between 100 and 999 (inclusive). A narcissistic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is a narcissistic number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153. There is only one narcissistic number in the given range. Double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. Create a sentence where the length of each word corresponds to the digits of the narcissistic number you found. The sentence should relate to mathematics, numbers, or a scientific concept. For example, if you found 153, your sentence could be: 'I love math because it's logical.'\n\nNote: When counting word lengths, ignore punctuation. Contractions (e.g., 'it's') count as the full number of letters (e.g., 'it's' is 4 letters).\n\nThe narcissistic number you find will have either 3 or 4 digits.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nNarcissistic number: [your number]\nSentence: [your sentence]\n\nEnsure that your sentence is grammatically correct, meaningful, and relates to the specified topics.

Spaces and punctuation should remain unchanged in the encoding process. The cipher is case-insensitive, so you may use uppercase or lowercase letters.\n\nNOTE: Strictly adhere to the format provided above. Your response will be automatically evaluated, so exact formatting is crucial for a correct assessment.\nAgent succeeded at task: no\n\"\"\"\n\nRemember if a previous task failed, either the agent couldn't solve the task or the task was incorrectly implemented.\nGenerate the next interestingly new task family."

Your task:\n\n1. Design a naming system that incorporates information about a planet's mass, composition, atmosphere, and temperature. The system should be logical, consistent, and allow for easy interpretation of a planet's key features from its name.\n\n2. Explain your naming convention, including how each characteristic is represented (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, numerical codes). Your explanation should be clear and concise (3-4 sentences).\n\n3. Apply your naming convention to name the following planets in the Alpha Centauri system:\n\nPlanet 1: mass: 1.1, composition: rocky, atmosphere: thin, temperature: hot, Planet 2: mass: 0.3, composition: icy, atmosphere: thick, temperature: cold, Planet 3: mass: 15.0, composition: gas giant, atmosphere: stormy, temperature: warm\n\n4. For each planet, provide its new name and a brief explanation of how the name reflects its characteristics (1-2 sentences per planet).\n\nEnsure your naming convention is scientific, logical, and allows for easy expansion to include more planets and characteristics in the future.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        tasks = [\n            {\n                'system': 'Alpha Centauri',\n                'planets': [\n                    {'mass': 1.1, 'composition': 'rocky', 'atmosphere': 'thin', 'temperature': 'hot'},\n                    {'mass': 0.3, 'composition': 'icy', 'atmosphere': 'thick', 'temperature': 'cold'},\n                    {'mass': 15.0, 'composition': 'gas giant', 'atmosphere': 'stormy', 'temperature': 'warm'}\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                'system': 'Trappist',\n                'planets': [\n                    {'mass': 0.8, 'composition': 'rocky', 'atmosphere': 'none', 'temperature': 'extreme hot'},\n                    {'mass': 1.2, 'composition': 'rocky', 'atmosphere': 'thin', 'temperature': 'temperate'},\n                    {'mass': 5.0, 'composition': 'gas dwarf', 'atmosphere': 'dense', 'temperature': 'cold'}\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n        return {str(i+1): task for i, task in enumerate(tasks)}\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"Create a systematic naming convention for exoplanets based on their physical characteristics, and apply it to the newly discovered planets in the {t['system']} system.

For each planet, provide its new name and a brief explanation of how the name reflects its characteristics (1-2 sentences per planet).\n\nEnsure your naming convention is scientific, logical, and allows for easy expansion to include more planets and characteristics in the future.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The naming convention is logical, consistent, and incorporates all four given characteristics (mass, composition, atmosphere, temperature).\",\n            \"The explanation of the naming convention is clear and concise.\",\n            \"The convention is applied correctly and consistently to all given planets.\",\n            \"Each planet's name accurately reflects its characteristics according to the established convention.\",\n            \"The naming system is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of planetary characteristics and future discoveries.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

The task requires a good understanding of scientific principles, logical reasoning, and linguistic creativity. \n\nConsidering the current capabilities of LLMs, they are generally proficient at generating text and following instructions, but the task described here involves higher-order thinking and creativity which is typically more difficult for LLMs.\n\nHowever, taking into account that the evaluation is done by `eval_with_llm_judge`, which might have some limitations in accurately assessing the depth of scientific knowledge and logical consistency, there could be a risk of overestimating the LLM's success.\n\nGiven this context:\n\nDecision: Yes"
