            "1. System Design:\n   a) The biomimetic nanotechnology system is composed of a network of nanostructured surfaces inspired by the Lotus leaf, designed to aggregate and capture microplastic particles from ocean water. The system includes floating mats that cover extensive areas of the North Pacific Gyre. Each mat consists of a mesh of nanostructured fibers that mimic the hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties of Lotus leaves. These fibers are made from a biodegradable polymer infused with hydrophobic nanoparticles.\n   b) The system incorporates principles from Lotus leaf water-repellent properties by using nanostructures that create a superhydrophobic surface, resulting in water droplets rolling off and carrying away contaminants. The nanostructured fibers have a hierarchical roughness that traps microplastics while repelling water, similar to the micro- and nanoscale structures found on Lotus leaves.\n   c) By deploying these mats in the North Pacific Gyre, the system captures floating microplastics as water flows through the mesh. The hydrophobic properties ensure that microplastics adhere to the fibers while water passes through. Periodic collection of the mats allows for the removal of accumulated microplastics and their subsequent recycling or disposal.\n   d) Diagram: Imagine a large, floating mat with a honeycomb-like structure. Each cell contains nanostructured fibers arranged vertically, maximizing surface area for capturing microplastics. The mats are anchored to buoys to maintain their position within the gyre.\n\n2. Nanotechnology Integration:\n   a) The system uses nanomaterials such as hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes embedded in biodegradable polymer fibers.\n   b) Hydrophobic silica nanoparticles provide the necessary water-repellent properties due to their low surface energy, while carbon nanotubes add mechanical strength and durability. The hierarchical roughness created by these nanomaterials enhances the system's ability to trap microplastics.\n   c) Novel nanofabrication techniques, such as electrospinning and layer-by-layer assembly, are employed to create the nanostructured fibers. Electrospinning allows for the production of fine fibers with controlled diameters, while layer-by-layer assembly ensures the uniform distribution of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix.\n\n3. Environmental Impact Analysis:\n   a) The positive impacts include the significant reduction of microplastic pollution in the North Pacific Gyre, leading to improved marine health and reduced ingestion of plastics by marine organisms. The biodegradable nature of the materials minimizes long-term environmental footprint.\n   b) Potential negative consequences include the disruption of marine life due to the presence of the mats and the risk of nanomaterials entering the food chain if they degrade inappropriately. Additionally, the collection process might disturb aquatic ecosystems.\n   c) To mitigate adverse effects, the system could include sensors to monitor marine life interactions, ensuring minimal disruption. Regular maintenance and replacement of mats can prevent degradation of materials. Implementing strict protocols for recycling captured microplastics and safe disposal of used mats will further reduce environmental risks.\n\n4. Scalability and Implementation:\n   a) Scaling up the system to achieve 85% efficiency involves increasing the number of deployed mats and optimizing their arrangement to maximize coverage. Developing efficient logistics for deploying, maintaining, and collecting the mats is crucial.\n   b) Challenges include harsh ocean conditions and potential damage to the mats. Solutions involve using durable materials and designing modular, easily replaceable components. Collaborating with marine research institutions can provide real-time data to optimize deployment strategies.\n   c) The timeline for development includes 2-3 years for research and prototyping, followed by 1-2 years for pilot testing and refinement. Full-scale deployment could take an additional 2-3 years. Resources required include funding for research, manufacturing facilities, and partnerships with environmental organizations.\n\n5. Ethical Implications:\n   a) Ethical considerations include the potential impact on marine ecosystems and the responsibility to ensure that the technology does not cause more harm than good. Transparency in research and development processes is essential.\n   b) Unintended consequences might include the introduction of new pollutants from the degradable materials or unforeseen interactions with marine life. Addressing these requires continuous monitoring and adaptive management strategies.\n   c) Guidelines for responsible development include conducting thorough environmental impact assessments, engaging with stakeholders such as local communities and environmental groups, and adhering to international regulations on marine pollution and nanotechnology use.\n\n6. Interdisciplinary Connections:\n   a) The design integrates biological insights from the Lotus leaf's microstructure, engineering principles for creating durable and deployable systems, materials science for developing nanostructures, and environmental studies to understand the ecological impact and optimize deployment.\n   b) A novel research question could be: \"How can the principles of biomimetic design be further applied to create multifunctional nanostructures that simultaneously capture pollutants and support marine life?\"",
            "1. System Design\na) The biomimetic nanotechnology system, inspired by the Lotus leaf's natural water-repellent properties, consists of a network of floating microplastic collectors, each embedded with nanoscale hierarchical structures. These collectors are designed to capture and isolate microplastics from seawater. The key components include hydrophobic nanocoatings, micro-mesh filters, and a central collection and processing unit. The system operates by allowing water to flow through the mesh while trapping microplastics, which are then conveyed to the central unit for removal and processing.\n\nb) The system incorporates principles from the Lotus leaf by utilizing nanoscale structures that mimic the leaf's surface. The Lotus leaf's surface is covered with microscopic bumps and a waxy coating, creating a superhydrophobic effect that repels water and contaminants. Similarly, the collectors in our system have nano-structured surfaces that repel water, ensuring that microplastics adhere to the collectors while water passes through. This design enhances the efficiency of microplastic capture and prevents biofouling.\n\nc) The system addresses Ocean microplastic pollution by deploying multiple interconnected collectors in the North Pacific Gyre, an area known for high concentrations of microplastics. The collectors float on the ocean surface, passively filtering water and capturing microplastics. Once collected, microplastics are transported to a central unit where they are sorted, stored, and eventually removed from the marine environment for recycling or safe disposal.\n\nd) Diagram Description: Imagine a series of floating devices, each resembling a large, flat dish with a fine mesh bottom. These dishes are connected by flexible tubes to a central buoy that houses the collection and processing unit. The mesh surfaces of the dishes have nano-structured coatings, and as water flows through them, microplastics are trapped and funneled to the central unit.\n\n2. Nanotechnology Integration\na) The system uses nanomaterials such as hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. The silica nanoparticles form the primary nanostructures on the mesh surfaces, providing the superhydrophobic properties. Carbon nanotubes are incorporated into the mesh to enhance strength and durability.\n\nb) Silica nanoparticles are chosen for their ease of fabrication, tunable size, and non-toxic nature. They create a rough surface at the nanoscale, essential for superhydrophobicity. Carbon nanotubes are selected for their exceptional mechanical strength, flexibility, and chemical resistance, making them ideal for the harsh marine environment.\n\nc) A novel nanofabrication technique known as electrospinning is used to create the mesh with embedded silica nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. This technique allows for precise control over the nanostructure formation and ensures uniform coating on the mesh surfaces. Additionally, a layer-by-layer assembly method is employed to apply the hydrophobic coating systematically.\n\n3. Environmental Impact Analysis\na) The system's positive impacts include reducing the amount of microplastic pollution in the North Pacific Gyre, which can lead to healthier marine ecosystems and a decrease in ingestion of plastics by marine life. By removing microplastics, the system can help prevent the transfer of toxic contaminants through the food chain, ultimately benefiting human health.\n\nb) Potential negative ecological consequences include the risk of non-target organisms becoming entrapped in the mesh collectors and the possibility of introducing nanomaterials into the marine environment if the system degrades. These factors could disrupt local ecosystems and marine life behaviors.\n\nc) To mitigate adverse effects, the mesh size and design are optimized to minimize bycatch, allowing smaller organisms to pass through unharmed. The nanomaterials used are selected for their environmental stability and non-toxicity. Additionally, regular maintenance and monitoring protocols are established to ensure the system remains intact and functional, preventing degradation and potential contamination.\n\n4. Scalability and Implementation\na) Scaling up the system involves deploying a larger network of collectors and enhancing the efficiency of the central processing unit. This can be achieved by modular design, allowing easy addition of new collectors, and using renewable energy sources like solar panels to power the central unit.\n\nb) Challenges specific to the North Pacific Gyre include harsh weather conditions and remote location, which can impede maintenance and monitoring.

Your total response should be between 1150-1450 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of biomimetics, nanotechnology, and environmental science.\",\n            f\"The system design is innovative, plausible, and clearly explains how it addresses {t['challenge']} in the {t['deployment_area']}.\",\n            \"The nanotechnology integration is well-reasoned and specific, with clear explanations of nanomaterial properties and fabrication techniques.\",\n            \"The environmental impact analysis is comprehensive and balanced, considering both positive and negative effects.\",\n            f\"The scalability and implementation discussion is realistic and detailed, addressing the target efficiency of {t['target_efficiency']}.\",\n            f\"The ethical implications are thoroughly explored, considering the specific context of the {t['deployment_area']}.\",\n            \"The interdisciplinary connections are insightful and well-articulated.\",\n            \"The response includes a clear diagram or schematic representation of the system (described textually).\",\n            \"The overall response shows strong integration of knowledge from multiple disciplines.\",\n            \"The proposed solution is creative while maintaining scientific plausibility.\",\n            \"The response adheres to the specified word limits for each section and overall length.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"
