It reflects the cultural value placed on diligence, hard work, and the often overwhelming demands of modern life. By using this idiom, individuals can communicate their need for assistance in a light-hearted yet effective manner, emphasizing the intensity of their workload.\n\n*c) Analyze the linguistic devices used*\nThe idiom employs metaphor by comparing the speaker's need for help to the absurdity of requesting assistance from a cat. This exaggeration underscores the speaker's desperation in a humorous and relatable way. Additionally, the idiom uses imagery, as it conjures a vivid picture of a cat's paws, making the expression more memorable and impactful.\n\n**2. Cross-Cultural Comparison**\n\n*a) Compare this idiom to similar expressions in other cultures*\nIn English, a comparable idiom might be \"I'm swamped\" or \"I'm up to my ears in work,\" though these lack the whimsical quality of involving an animal. An idiom like \"I'd take help from a monkey\" might come closer but is less common. Another similar expression is the French \"\u00eatre d\u00e9bord\u00e9\" (to be overwhelmed), which also conveys a sense of being inundated with tasks.\n\n*b) Discuss how the concept might be expressed differently in various cultural contexts*\nDifferent cultures may use local animals or objects in their idioms to convey similar meanings. For example, in Russian, one might say \"\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0435\u0432\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\" (del nevprovrot), meaning \"work up to one's neck.\" Each culture adapts the idiom to its societal norms and familiar references, though the underlying concept of overwhelming busyness remains consistent.\n\n**3. Fictional Culture Development**\n\n*a) Describe key aspects of the fictional Underwater civilization*\nThe fictional Underwater civilization, known as the Aquarins, resides in vast oceanic domes made of bioluminescent coral. Their society is highly structured with a strong emphasis on communal living and cooperation. The Aquarins value harmony with nature, using sustainable practices to ensure the ocean's health. They have advanced communication methods, utilizing bioluminescent signals and echolocation.\n\n*b) Explain how these cultural elements might influence their language and expressions*\nGiven their environment and values, Aquarin language would likely incorporate many references to marine life and natural phenomena. Expressions would emphasize collaboration and environmental awareness. Idioms might involve sea creatures known for their unique behaviors or characteristics, reflecting the society's interconnectedness with their underwater world.\n\n**4. New Idiom Creation**\n\n*a) Propose a new idiom that could exist in the Underwater civilization*\nThe new idiom is \"\u30af\u30e9\u30b2\u306e\u89e6\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044 (kurage no shokushu mo karitai).\"\n\n*b) Provide its literal translation and explain its figurative meaning*\nThe literal translation is \"I want to borrow even a jellyfish's tentacles.\" Figuratively, it means being so overwhelmed with tasks that one would accept help from anyone, even from a jellyfish, which is typically seen as a passive creature in the Aquarin culture.\n\n*c) Justify how this idiom reflects the fictional culture's characteristics*\nThis idiom reflects the Aquarins' familiarity with marine life and their unique environmental context. Jellyfish, known for their drifting nature, symbolize minimal effort or assistance. By invoking jellyfish, the idiom humorously highlights the speaker's desperation while staying true to the underwater theme. It mirrors the cultural emphasis on communal effort and the willingness to accept help from all community members, however minimal.\n\n**5. Linguistic Analysis of New Idiom**\n\n*a) Analyze the linguistic devices used in your created idiom*\nThe idiom uses metaphor by comparing the need for assistance to the absurdity of borrowing a jellyfish's tentacles. It also employs imagery, evoking a clear picture of a jellyfish, which enhances its memorability. The idiom benefits from the cultural context of the Aquarins, making it relatable and effective within their society.\n\n*b) Explain how these devices contribute to the idiom's effectiveness and memorability*\nThe metaphor and vivid imagery make the idiom both humorous and striking, ensuring it resonates with the Aquarins. The cultural reference to jellyfish, a common yet passive creature, underscores the speaker's desperation in a way that is instantly understandable and visually engaging, reinforcing its memorability and impact.\n\n**6. Comparative Reflection**\n\n*a) Compare your created idiom to the original Japanese idiom*\nBoth idioms express a sense of being overwhelmed and in desperate need of help, using animals (a cat and a jellyfish) to highlight the absurdity of the situation. While the Japanese idiom uses a land animal familiar to its culture, the Aquarin idiom appropriately uses a marine creature, aligning with their underwater environment.\n\n*b) Discuss how cultural differences are reflected in these expressions*\nThe cultural differences are evident in the choice of animals and the environmental context. The Japanese idiom reflects a terrestrial, everyday life scenario, whereas the Aquarin idiom mirrors their underwater existence. Both idioms, however, effectively convey the universal human experience of needing help, demonstrating how cultural context shapes expression while maintaining relatable core sentiments.",
            "### 1. Idiom Analysis\n\n#### a) Meaning of the Idiom\nThe idiom \"\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044 (neko no te mo karitai)\" translates literally to \"I want to borrow even a cat's paws.\" It means being so busy or overwhelmed with tasks that one is willing to accept help from anyone, even a cat, which is typically not useful for human tasks.\n\n#### b) Cultural Significance and Usage\nIn Japanese society, this idiom is used to express extreme busyness or a desperate need for assistance. It underscores the cultural emphasis on diligence and hard work. When someone uses this phrase, it indicates that they are overwhelmed but still committed to completing their tasks, reflecting a societal value placed on perseverance and dedication.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Devices\nThe idiom employs metaphor by comparing the need for help to borrowing a cat's paws, which are not typically useful for human activities. This metaphor creates a vivid image of desperation and busyness, making the idiom memorable and effective. The use of a cat, an animal often associated with independence and aloofness, adds a layer of irony, enhancing the idiom's impact.\n\n### 2. Cross-Cultural Comparison\n\n#### a) Similar Expressions in Other Cultures\nIn English, a similar expression is \"I need all hands on deck,\" which also signifies a desperate need for help. Another example is \"I could use an extra pair of hands,\" which indicates being overwhelmed with tasks.\n\n#### b) Different Cultural Expressions\nWhile the Japanese idiom uses a cat to convey the message, other cultures might use different metaphors. For instance, in Chinese, there is a phrase \"\u5fd9\u5f97\u56e2\u56e2\u8f6c\" (m\u00e1ng d\u00e9 tu\u00e1n tu\u00e1n zhu\u00e0n), meaning \"so busy that one is spinning in circles.\" Each culture uses unique imagery that resonates with its societal values and daily experiences, reflecting different ways of expressing the concept of being overwhelmed.\n\n### 3. Fictional Culture Development\n\n#### a) Key Aspects of the Underwater Civilization\nThe fictional Underwater civilization, called Aquatopia, exists in a vast oceanic environment with bioluminescent coral cities.

            "### Idiom Analysis\n\n#### a) Meaning of the Idiom\nThe Japanese idiom \"\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044 (neko no te mo karitai)\" translates literally to \"I want to borrow even a cat's paws.\" It is used to express a situation where one is extremely busy or overwhelmed and in dire need of help, to the extent that even the assistance of a cat, which is generally not useful for work, would be appreciated.\n\n#### b) Cultural Significance and Usage\nIn Japanese society, this idiom is commonly used in both professional and personal settings to emphasize the urgency and pressure of a situation. It reflects the cultural value placed on hard work and diligence. The idiom is particularly significant in Japan's collectivist culture, where teamwork and mutual support are highly valued. The use of a cat, an animal known for its independence and lack of utility in work, underscores the extremity of the situation.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Devices Used\nThe idiom employs metaphor by using \"cat's paws\" to symbolize minimal or typically unhelpful assistance. This exaggeration effectively conveys the speaker\u2019s desperation. Additionally, it utilizes a form of hyperbole to emphasize the extent of the need for help. The imagery of a cat\u2019s paws, which are not associated with labor, creates a humorous yet poignant contrast, making the idiom both memorable and impactful.\n\n### Cross-Cultural Comparison\n\n#### a) Similar Expressions\nIn English, a similar expression might be \"I'm so busy I'd take help from anyone,\" or \"I need all hands on deck.\" In Spanish, \"Estar hasta las cejas de trabajo\" (to be up to the eyebrows in work) conveys a similar sense of being overwhelmed. These idioms reflect a universal human experience of needing assistance when overburdened.\n\n#### b) Cultural Contexts\nWhile the Japanese idiom uses the metaphor of a cat's paws, English and Spanish idioms often employ more direct references to people or body parts. This difference highlights varying cultural tendencies: Japanese idioms often use indirect and imaginative imagery, while English and Spanish expressions may be more straightforward. These differences reflect broader cultural patterns in communication styles.\n\n### Fictional Culture Development\n\n#### a) Key Aspects of the Underwater Civilization\nThe fictional Underwater civilization, named \"Aquaria,\" resides in a vast oceanic trench. Their environment is characterized by bioluminescent flora and fauna, with a reliance on geothermal vents for warmth. Socially, Aquarians are highly communal, valuing cooperation and mutual support. Their society is structured around clans that specialize in different tasks such as hunting, gathering, and crafting. Aquarians place a high value on adaptability and resourcefulness due to the changing and often harsh underwater conditions.\n\n#### b) Cultural Influence on Language and Expressions\nGiven their environment, Aquarian language and expressions likely revolve around marine life and underwater phenomena. Their idioms would reflect the importance of community and cooperation, as well as their intimate knowledge of the ocean\u2019s resources and dangers. Expressions would often draw from their daily interactions with the sea and its creatures, emphasizing adaptability and the collective effort required to thrive in such an environment.\n\n### New Idiom Creation\n\n#### a) Proposed New Idiom\n\"\u30b5\u30f3\u30b4\u306e\u89e6\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044 (sango no shokusyu mo karitai)\"\n\n#### b) Literal Translation and Figurative Meaning\nLiteral translation: \"I want to borrow even a coral's tentacles.\" Figurative meaning: This idiom expresses a state of being so overwhelmed that one would even seek help from a coral\u2019s tentacles, which are not typically associated with providing significant assistance.\n\n#### c) Justification\nThis idiom reflects the Aquarian culture\u2019s reliance on marine elements and their communal values. Corals, though stationary and seemingly passive, are integral to the underwater ecosystem, much like how even minimal help is valued in a tight-knit community. The idiom underscores the importance of every member's contribution, no matter how small, in their collective survival and prosperity.\n\n### Linguistic Analysis of New Idiom\n\n#### a) Linguistic Devices Used\nThe idiom uses metaphor by equating coral tentacles to minimal assistance. It also employs hyperbole to stress the speaker\u2019s desperate need for help. The imagery of coral\u2019s tentacles, usually seen as passive, creates a striking contrast that highlights the urgency of the situation.\n\n#### b) Contribution to Effectiveness and Memorability\nThe metaphor of coral\u2019s tentacles is effective due to its vivid imagery, rooted in the daily life of the Aquarians. The hyperbolic nature of the idiom makes it memorable, as it humorously yet poignantly conveys the extremity of the need for assistance. This combination of relatable imagery and exaggeration ensures the idiom\u2019s resonance within the Aquarian culture.\n\n### Comparative Reflection\n\n#### a) Comparison to the Original Japanese Idiom\nBoth idioms express a similar concept of being overwhelmed and in need of any possible help. The Japanese idiom uses \"cat's paws,\" while the Aquarian idiom uses \"coral's tentacles.\" Both employ metaphor and hyperbole, though the cultural imagery differs\u2014land-based for Japan and marine-based for Aquaria.\n\n#### b) Cultural Differences Reflected\nThe use of a cat in the Japanese idiom reflects a land-based, domesticated animal that is part of everyday life in Japan. In contrast, the Aquarian idiom\u2019s use of coral tentacles reflects the underwater environment and the integral role of marine life in their society. These differences highlight how cultural context shapes the metaphors and imagery used in idiomatic expressions, grounding them in the daily experiences and values of each culture.",

It is often used in professional settings where work overload is common, such as during peak business seasons or tight deadlines. The idiom reflects the high value placed on diligence and hard work in Japanese culture. It also subtly conveys a sense of humility, as the speaker admits to being overwhelmed and in need of help.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Devices\nThe idiom employs metaphor by suggesting borrowing the paws of a cat, an improbable and humorous image, to emphasize the extent of the speaker's desperation. The effectiveness lies in its vivid imagery and the cultural context where cats are seen as independent and somewhat aloof creatures, adding to the idiom's humorous yet relatable nature.\n\n### 2. Cross-Cultural Comparison\n\n#### a) Similar Expressions in Other Cultures\nIn English, a comparable expression might be \"I need all hands on deck,\" which also signifies a need for everyone's help due to a busy situation. The French say \"avoir du pain sur la planche\" (having bread on the board), meaning having a lot of work to do.\n\n#### b) Different Cultural Expressions\nWhile both the Japanese and English idioms involve a sense of urgency and collective effort, the Japanese idiom's use of a cat adds a layer of humor and humility. In contrast, the English expression is more straightforward and maritime-themed, reflecting different cultural contexts and values related to work and urgency.\n\n### 3. Fictional Culture Development\n\n#### a) Key Aspects of the Underwater Civilization\nThe fictional underwater civilization, called Aquatica, resides in a vast oceanic realm with bioluminescent corals and intricate reef cities. Social structure is hierarchical, with clans based on different marine species (e.g., dolphins, octopi, and seahorses). Values include community collaboration, resourcefulness, and respect for the ocean's balance.\n\n#### b) Cultural Influence on Language\nAquatica's language likely incorporates marine life metaphors and emphasizes fluidity and interconnectedness, reflecting their environment and social values. Expressions might involve aquatic imagery and emphasize communal effort and harmony with nature.\n\n### 4. New Idiom Creation\n\n#### a) Proposed Idiom\n\"\u30af\u30e9\u30b2\u306e\u8db3\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044 (kurage no ashi mo karitai)\"\n\n#### b) Literal Translation and Figurative Meaning\nLiteral Translation: \"I want to borrow even a jellyfish's tentacles.\"\nFigurative Meaning: This idiom expresses a situation where one is so overwhelmed with tasks that they are willing to accept help from even the most unlikely and seemingly impractical sources.\n\n#### c) Justification\nJellyfish in Aquatica are seen as beautiful but not particularly useful for tasks requiring dexterity. The idiom reflects the civilization\u2019s appreciation for all marine life while humorously acknowledging their limitations. It underscores values of community and resourcefulness, as even the least likely helpers are considered valuable in times of need.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Analysis of New Idiom\n\n#### a) Linguistic Devices\nThis idiom uses metaphor, similar to the Japanese idiom, by suggesting borrowing jellyfish tentacles for help. It also employs a touch of irony, as jellyfish are not known for their utility in laborious tasks, thereby emphasizing the speaker's desperation.\n\n#### b) Contribution to Effectiveness and Memorability\nThe vivid and somewhat humorous imagery of jellyfish tentacles makes the idiom memorable. The metaphor highlights the extremity of the situation, while the cultural context of valuing all marine life adds depth and relatability, making the idiom both effective and culturally resonant.\n\n### 6. Comparative Reflection\n\n#### a) Comparison to the Original Japanese Idiom\nBoth idioms use animals with limited practical utility to express extreme need for help. The Japanese idiom uses a cat, while the Aquatica idiom uses a jellyfish, each reflecting their respective environments and cultural values.\n\n#### b) Reflection of Cultural Differences\nThe Japanese idiom reflects a culture that values humility and diligence, using a familiar domestic animal. The Aquatica idiom, on the other hand, reflects an underwater civilization\u2019s appreciation for all marine life and communal effort, even if the help seems impractical. These differences highlight how each culture\u2019s values and environment shape their unique expressions."

It is similar to the English expression \"when pigs fly,\" indicating an event that is impossible or improbable.\n\n#### b) Cultural Significance and Usage\nIn Russian society, this idiom is a colorful way to express skepticism or to emphasize the unlikely nature of a situation. Its usage reflects a cultural appreciation for vivid and imaginative language. It is often employed in everyday conversations to dismiss unrealistic plans or promises humorously. It also demonstrates a cultural tendency to use nature and animals in metaphorical expressions, perhaps reflecting a historical connection to the natural environment.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Devices\nThe idiom uses metaphor by combining elements that are naturally incompatible\u2014lobsters do not whistle, nor do they live on mountains. This absurdity effectively conveys impossibility. The imagery is vivid and memorable, employing a form of hyperbole to emphasize the unlikelihood.

Cross-Cultural Comparison**\n\na) Similar expressions in other cultures include the English idiom \"when pigs fly\" and the Spanish \"cuando las ranas cr\u00eden pelo\" (when frogs grow hair). Both convey the same idea of an event that will never happen.\n\nb) The concept of impossibility is universally understood, but the specific imagery used reflects cultural differences. In English, pigs are used, while in Spanish, frogs are used. Each culture selects an animal and action that feels absurd within its context, showing how different environments and cultural experiences shape idiomatic expressions.\n\n**3. Fictional Culture Development**\n\na) The fictional Desert nomads live in a vast, arid desert with scarce water sources. They are a resilient, tight-knit community that values resourcefulness, survival skills, and deep respect for nature. Socially, they are organized into tribes led by elders who possess extensive knowledge of the desert's secrets. Their values emphasize cooperation, endurance, and wisdom.\n\nb) These cultural elements would influence their language to include references to their harsh environment and survival tactics. Their expressions would likely highlight the importance of water, the sun, and the sand, reflecting their daily challenges and deep connection to their surroundings.\n\n**4. New Idiom Creation**\n\na) Proposed idiom: \"\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0435\u0442\" (Kogda verblyud v teni tantsuyet).\n\nb) Literal translation: \"When a camel dances in the shade.\"\n\nc) Figurative meaning: This idiom means something that is highly improbable or will never happen. In the harsh desert environment, camels are essential for transportation and survival, and they typically rest rather than dance, especially in the scarce shade available. The image of a camel dancing, which is not a natural behavior for this animal, highlights the absurdity and impossibility of the situation.\n\n**5. Linguistic Analysis of New Idiom**\n\na) The idiom uses metaphor and personification. The metaphor lies in the camel, an animal integral to the Desert nomads' life, performing an unlikely action\u2014dancing. Personification is present in attributing a human-like activity (dancing) to an animal.\n\nb) These devices contribute to the idiom's effectiveness by creating a vivid and humorous image that is easy to visualize and remember. The absurdity of the image reinforces the message of improbability, making it a memorable expression within the cultural context of the Desert nomads.\n\n**6. Comparative Reflection**\n\na) Both the created idiom \"\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0435\u0442\" and the original Russian idiom \"\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0442\" convey a sense of impossibility. However, they use different animals and actions relevant to their cultural contexts\u2014the lobster in mountainous terrain for Russians and the camel in the shade for the Desert nomads.\n\nb) The cultural differences are reflected in the choice of animals and scenarios. The Russian idiom uses a sea creature in an unlikely environment, reflecting a connection to both land and sea. The Desert nomads' idiom uses a camel, central to their survival, in an absurd situation, highlighting their dependence on and familiarity with this animal. These choices illustrate how cultural environments shape the creation and understanding of idiomatic expressions.",
            "### Idiom Analysis\n\n#### a) Explanation of the Idiom\nThe Russian idiom \"\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0442 (Kogda rak na gore svistnet),\" which literally translates to \"When a lobster whistles on a mountain,\" is used to signify something that will never happen or is extremely unlikely to occur. It is comparable to the English idiom \"When pigs fly.\"\n\n#### b) Cultural Significance and Usage\nIn Russian society, this idiom is employed to express skepticism or doubt about the feasibility of an event or action. It often carries a humorous undertone and is used in both casual and formal contexts to playfully dismiss unrealistic plans or promises. The idiom reflects a common cultural theme in Russian humor and literature, which frequently employs surreal or exaggerated imagery to convey skepticism or irony.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Devices Used\nThe idiom uses metaphor and imagery effectively. The idea of a lobster, which lives in water, whistling on a mountain, an unlikely habitat for such a creature, creates a vivid and absurd picture. This absurdity captures the impossibility of the event, making the idiom memorable and impactful. The unexpected combination of elements (lobster, mountain, whistling) also adds a layer of humor, reinforcing its effectiveness.\n\n### Cross-Cultural Comparison\n\n#### a) Similar Expressions in Other Cultures\nMany cultures have idioms that express the impossibility of an event. For example, in English, \"When pigs fly\" is a common expression. In Spanish, \"Cuando las ranas cr\u00eden pelo\" (When frogs grow hair) serves a similar purpose. Each idiom uses an image that is absurd or impossible within its cultural context.\n\n#### b) Cultural Expression Variations\nThese idioms reflect the natural environments and cultural elements familiar to each society. While the Russian idiom uses a lobster and a mountain, the English idiom uses pigs, and the Spanish idiom uses frogs, each chosen for their respective cultural resonance. These idioms highlight how different cultures use familiar yet impossible scenarios to express doubt or incredulity.\n\n### Fictional Culture Development\n\n#### a) Desert Nomads\u2019 Key Aspects\nThe fictional Desert nomads live in a vast, arid desert environment characterized by extreme temperatures and scarce water sources. Their social structure is tribal, with strong kinship ties and a leader or council of elders guiding the community. They value resourcefulness, adaptability, and a deep reverence for nature, particularly water and the few plants and animals that thrive in their harsh environment.\n\n#### b) Influence on Language and Expressions\nGiven their environment, the Desert nomads\u2019 language would likely include numerous references to survival elements such as water, shade, and the endurance of both people and animals. Their expressions would reflect the challenges they face daily, emphasizing resilience, the value of cooperation, and the unpredictability of nature.\n\n### New Idiom Creation\n\n#### a) Proposed New Idiom\n\"\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0451\u0442 \u0432 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043d\u0435 (Kogda verblyud zapoyot v pustyne).\"\n\n#### b) Literal Translation and Figurative Meaning\nLiteral translation: \"When a camel sings in the desert.\"\nFigurative meaning: This idiom signifies something that is highly improbable or will never happen, akin to the camel, a symbol of desert resilience and practicality, doing something as fanciful and unlikely as singing.\n\n#### c) Cultural Reflection\nThis idiom reflects the Desert nomads' intimate connection with their environment and the animals that are crucial to their survival. The camel is a central figure in their daily life, symbolizing endurance and practicality. Imagining a camel singing, an act far removed from its nature, underscores the improbability of the event, much like the Russian idiom with the lobster whistling. This imagery is both humorous and memorable, rooted in the nomads' cultural context.\n\n### Linguistic Analysis of New Idiom\n\n#### a) Linguistic Devices Used\nThe idiom employs metaphor and vivid imagery. The camel, a familiar and practical animal in the desert, is juxtaposed with the act of singing, which is out of character and absurd. This contrast creates a strong visual and cognitive dissonance, enhancing the idiom's memorability.\n\n#### b) Contribution to Effectiveness and Memorability\nThe unexpected combination of a practical desert animal and a whimsical action makes the idiom striking and easy to remember. The metaphor captures the essence of improbability effectively, while the humor embedded in the imagery ensures that the idiom resonates and sticks with listeners.\n\n### Comparative Reflection\n\n#### a) Comparison to the Original Russian Idiom\nBoth idioms use animals in unlikely scenarios to express the improbability of an event. The Russian idiom uses a lobster whistling on a mountain, while the Desert nomads' idiom uses a camel singing in the desert. Both idioms are rooted in their respective cultural contexts, using familiar yet absurd imagery to convey their message.\n\n#### b) Reflection of Cultural Differences\nThe Russian idiom draws from a landscape that includes both mountains and aquatic animals, reflecting a diverse natural environment. In contrast, the Desert nomads' idiom draws from the harsh desert landscape, focusing on the camel, a central figure in their survival. These differences highlight how idioms encapsulate the unique environmental and cultural elements of their origins, providing insight into the values and daily realities of the societies that use them.\n\nAnswer:",
            "### Idiom Analysis\n\n#### a) Explanation of the Idiom\nThe Russian idiom \"\u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0442 (Kogda rak na gore svistnet)\" translates literally to \"When a lobster whistles on a mountain.\" This phrase is used to signify something that is never going to happen or is highly unlikely. It is similar to the English expression \"when pigs fly,\" indicating an event that is impossible or improbable.\n\n#### b) Cultural Significance and Usage\nIn Russian society, this idiom is a colorful way to express skepticism or to emphasize the unlikely nature of a situation. Its usage reflects a cultural appreciation for vivid and imaginative language. It is often employed in everyday conversations to dismiss unrealistic plans or promises humorously. It also demonstrates a cultural tendency to use nature and animals in metaphorical expressions, perhaps reflecting a historical connection to the natural environment.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Devices\nThe idiom uses metaphor by combining elements that are naturally incompatible\u2014lobsters do not whistle, nor do they live on mountains. This absurdity effectively conveys impossibility. The imagery is vivid and memorable, employing a form of hyperbole to emphasize the unlikelihood. The combination of these linguistic devices makes the idiom both effective and engaging, as the absurdity captures attention and facilitates recall.\n\n### Cross-Cultural Comparison\n\n#### a) Similar Expressions in Other Cultures\nIn English, the phrase \"when pigs fly\" serves a similar purpose, indicating something impossible. In German, the idiom \"Wenn Schweine fliegen k\u00f6nnen\" also translates to \"when pigs can fly.\" In Spanish, \"cuando las ranas cr\u00eden pelo\" means \"when frogs grow hair,\" another impossibility.\n\n#### b) Different Cultural Expressions\nWhile the core concept remains the same\u2014expressing improbability\u2014each culture uses locally relevant imagery. These expressions reflect cultural elements such as common animals (pigs, frogs) and their perceived characteristics. The choice of animal or scenario can reveal how different cultures relate to their environment and what they find humorously impossible.\n\n### Fictional Culture Development\n\n#### a) Key Aspects of the Fictional Desert Nomads\nThe Desert nomads live in a harsh, arid environment with extreme temperatures and scarce water sources. Their social structure is tribal, with strong emphasis on community and survival. They value resourcefulness, resilience, and oral traditions, passing down knowledge through stories and proverbs. Their diet consists mainly of dates, goat milk, and occasional game. Water is a sacred and highly valued resource.\n\n#### b) Cultural Influence on Language and Expressions\nGiven their environment, the Desert nomads would likely use imagery related to the desert, survival, and elements crucial to their daily life, such as water and camels.

Proverbs and idioms would likely emphasize endurance, the rarity of certain events, and the wisdom of their ancestors.\n\n### New Idiom Creation\n\n#### a) Proposed New Idiom\n\"When the sand sings at noon.\"\n\n#### b) Literal Translation and Figurative Meaning\nLiteral Translation: \"When the sand sings at noon.\"\nFigurative Meaning: This idiom signifies something that is extremely unlikely to happen, much like the Russian idiom about the lobster and the mountain.\n\n#### c) Justification\nThe desert environment and the scorching midday heat are central to the life of the nomads. Sand, an omnipresent element of their surroundings, is used metaphorically to represent the impossible, as sand does not sing and noon is the hottest, most barren time of day. This idiom reflects the nomads' deep connection to their environment and the extremities they face, using familiar and vividly impossible imagery to communicate improbability.\n\n### Linguistic Analysis of New Idiom\n\n#### a) Linguistic Devices\nThe idiom uses metaphor and personification. Sand is given the human ability to sing, creating an immediate sense of impossibility. The time of noon, representing the harshest part of the day, adds to the hyperbolic nature of the idiom.\n\n#### b) Contribution to Effectiveness and Memorability\nThe vivid imagery of sand attempting to sing during the hottest time of day makes the idiom memorable. The use of personification adds a layer of absurdity that captures attention, making it easy to recall and use. The idiom effectively communicates the concept of impossibility through culturally relevant and striking imagery.\n\n### Comparative Reflection\n\n#### a) Comparison to Original Russian Idiom\nBoth idioms use vivid and absurd imagery to convey the idea of improbability. The Russian idiom uses a lobster and a mountain, elements that are familiar in the Russian context, while the Desert nomads' idiom uses sand and noon, which are central to their environment. Both idioms reflect their respective cultures' connection to their natural surroundings.\n\n#### b) Reflection of Cultural Differences\nThe Russian idiom reflects a culture with a historical connection to nature and possibly a sense of humor that appreciates the absurd. The Desert nomads' idiom reflects a harsh environment where survival is a daily concern, and the imagery used is directly tied to their immediate experience. These differences highlight how cultural context shapes the way improbability is expressed and understood, using locally relevant symbols and scenarios.",

            "content": "Given the task family \"cultural_idiom_translation,\" let's analyze the expectations and typical capabilities of current large language models (LLMs):\n\n### Task Complexity\n1. **Linguistic Analysis:** \n   - Understanding idioms and their cultural significance requires a deep grasp of language nuances and cultural context. \n   - LLMs like GPT-4 can generally handle this well, given sufficient training data and context.\n\n2. **Creative Writing:**\n   - Creating new idioms for fictional cultures involves significant creativity and the ability to extrapolate from known data.\n   - LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating creative content, especially when provided with structured prompts.\n\n3. **Cultural Understanding:**\n   - Comparing idioms across cultures and analyzing cultural influences on language is more complex.\n   - LLMs are trained on diverse datasets and can often make reasonable comparisons and analyses, but the depth and accuracy can vary.\n\n4. **Structured Reasoning:**\n   - Following detailed instructions and maintaining logical consistency across multiple sections is challenging.\n   - Advanced LLMs are generally good at maintaining structure and coherence if given clear and well-structured prompts.\n\n### Evaluation Considerations\n- **LLM Judge Suitability:** The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` suggests that the evaluation is automated and relies on the LLM's ability to judge the quality of another LLM's output. This can be effective but may lack the nuanced evaluation a human might provide, especially in complex cultural and creative tasks.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the complexity of the task and the need for deep cultural understanding, creative generation, and structured reasoning, a human evaluator might find it noteworthy if an LLM can successfully complete this task to a high standard. However, considering the current capabilities of advanced LLMs, which are generally proficient in linguistic analysis and creative tasks, the success might not be entirely surprising but still notable due to the task's multifaceted nature.\n\n**Decision: No**"
