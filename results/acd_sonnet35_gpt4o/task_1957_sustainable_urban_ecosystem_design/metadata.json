Resource Management (200-250 words):\n   a) Describe your strategy for managing key resources (e.g., energy, water, waste).\n   b) Explain how you'll transition to renewable energy sources over time.\n   c) Discuss your approach to circular economy principles and waste reduction.\n\n4. Environmental Impact and Mitigation (200-250 words):\n   a) Analyze the potential environmental impacts of your urban development.\n   b) Describe specific measures to mitigate these impacts and enhance biodiversity.\n   c) Explain how you'll monitor and adapt to changing environmental conditions.\n\n5. Social and Economic Policies (200-250 words):\n   a) Outline key policies to promote social equity and economic opportunity.\n   b) Describe your approach to housing, education, and healthcare.\n   c) Explain how you'll manage potential conflicts between economic growth and social/environmental goals.\n\n6. Resilience and Adaptation (150-200 words):\n   a) Describe how your city will adapt to and mitigate the effects of sea level rise.\n   b) Explain your strategy for handling potential crises (e.g., natural disasters, economic shocks).\n   c) Discuss how you'll maintain flexibility in your long-term plan to address unforeseen challenges.\n\n7. Ethical Considerations (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss the ethical implications of your urban development decisions.\n   b) Explain how you've balanced the needs of current and future generations.\n   c) Describe any potential unintended consequences of your plan and how you'll address them.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of urban planning, environmental science, economics, and social dynamics. Use appropriate terminology and provide clear explanations. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining plausibility. Your total response should be between 1450-1800 words.\n\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        scenarios = [\n            {\n                \"city_type\": \"coastal metropolis\",\n                \"initial_population\": 5000000,\n                \"climate_challenge\": \"sea level rise\",\n                \"economic_focus\": \"tourism and tech industry\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"city_type\": \"inland industrial center\",\n                \"initial_population\": 2000000,\n                \"climate_challenge\": \"extreme heat waves\",\n                \"economic_focus\": \"manufacturing and logistics\"\n            }\n        ]\n        return {str(i+1): scenario for i, scenario in enumerate(random.sample(scenarios, k=2))}\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"Design and manage a sustainable urban ecosystem for a {t['city_type']} with an initial population of {t['initial_population']}, focusing on balancing economic growth, environmental conservation, and social equity over a simulated 50-year period.
