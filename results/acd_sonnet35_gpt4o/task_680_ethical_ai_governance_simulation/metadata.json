Use clear headings for each section of your response.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response addresses all required sections comprehensively.\",\n            \"The proposed society and ethical framework are logically consistent and well-reasoned.\",\n            \"The analysis demonstrates a deep understanding of ethics, governance, and AI capabilities.\",\n            \"The response shows creativity and originality in addressing the given parameters.\",\n            \"The comparative evaluation provides insightful analysis of the proposed system's implications.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given what we know about the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), it's important to consider the complexity and multifaceted nature of the task. The task involves designing a simulated AI-governed society, addressing ethical dilemmas, and analyzing policy implementation and its consequences, which requires:\n\n1. **Ethical Reasoning**: Understanding and applying ethical principles to complex scenarios.\n2. **Game Theory Application**: Using theoretical frameworks to predict and analyze interactions within a society.\n3. **Policy Analysis**: Evaluating the effectiveness and implications of different policies.\n4. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Innovatively addressing challenges within the constraints provided.\n\nConsidering the task's description and the high estimated human difficulty, it is indeed a challenging task. Most current LLMs can generate text that appears coherent and well-reasoned, especially if they are trained on diverse datasets that include discussions on ethics, governance, and AI. However, the depth and originality required for this task, along with the need for a logically consistent and well-reasoned response across multiple sections, make it particularly challenging.\n\nThe use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring adds another layer of complexity. While LLMs can perform well in generating responses, evaluating the depth and creativity of those responses accurately is another challenge. If the LLM agent managed to succeed in this task, it indicates a significant capability in not only generating text but also in demonstrating a nuanced understanding of ethical and governance issues, which is noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
