There may also be trade-offs in terms of slower deployment of autonomous vehicles.\n\n#### c) Communication and Implementation\nClear communication with the public about the ethical guidelines and safety measures in place. Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure transparency and collective agreement on the implemented solutions.\n\n### 5. Future Implications\n\n#### a) Evolution of Ethical Dilemmas\nAs AI technology advances, dilemmas may become more complex, involving more nuanced decisions and potentially more stakeholders, such as AI interacting with other AI systems.\n\n#### b) Broader Societal Implications\nThese ethical challenges will necessitate a societal shift towards understanding and integrating AI ethics into everyday life, influencing education, legislation, and public discourse on technology's role in society.",
