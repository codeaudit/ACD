This task would measure the model's ability to synthesize knowledge from multiple domains, create novel representational systems, and apply them to problem-solving. It would be particularly interesting to see how the model handles the translation between abstract mathematical concepts, symbolic representation, and real-world applications. I believe this task would be very challenging for both humans and AI models, requiring a deep understanding of mathematics, linguistics, and various scientific domains.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"mathematical_symbolic_language\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Create a symbolic language based on mathematical concepts, then use it to represent and solve complex interdisciplinary problems.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary synthesis, abstract reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and creative problem-solving\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        mathematical_concepts = [\\n            \\\"topology\\\",\\n            \\\"group theory\\\",\\n            \\\"complex analysis\\\",\\n            \\\"differential geometry\\\"\\n        ]\\n        application_domains = [\\n            \\\"quantum computing\\\",\\n            \\\"evolutionary biology\\\",\\n            \\\"climate modeling\\\",\\n            \\\"cognitive neuroscience\\\"\\n        ]\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"math_concept\\\": random.choice(mathematical_concepts),\\n                \\\"application\\\": random.choice(application_domains)\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"math_concept\\\": random.choice(mathematical_concepts),\\n                \\\"application\\\": random.choice(application_domains)\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Create a symbolic language based on concepts from {t['math_concept']}, then use it to represent and solve a complex problem in {t['application']}.

            "### Symbolic Language Design\n\n#### Basic Elements and Rules\nIn our symbolic language, we base our elements on key concepts from chaos theory, such as attractors, bifurcations, and fractals. The following symbols are defined:\n\n- **A**: Attractor\n- **B**: Bifurcation\n- **F**: Fractal\n- **\u0394**: Sensitivity to initial conditions\n- **\u03a9**: Strange attractor\n- **L**: Lyapunov exponent (\u03bb)\n- **E**: Entropy\n\nRules:\n1. **Combinations**: Symbols can be combined to represent complex behaviors, e.g., **A\u0394** represents an attractor sensitive to initial conditions.\n2. **Operations**: Operations include addition (+), multiplication (*), and concatenation, which imply different chaos theory interactions.\n3. **Hierarchy**: Parentheses () are used to denote hierarchical structures or repeated behaviors.\n\n#### Mathematical Operations and Structures\nOur language uses:\n- **Addition (+)** to represent the union of chaotic behaviors.\n- **Multiplication (*)** to represent the interaction between different chaotic elements.\n- **Concatenation** for sequential application of chaotic behaviors.\n\n#### Examples\n- **A+\u03a9**: Represents a system with both regular and strange attractors.\n- **B*F**: Denotes a bifurcation leading to fractal-like structures.\n- **A\u0394 (\u03bb > 0)**: An attractor with sensitivity to initial conditions and a positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating chaos.\n\n#### Extension to Cryptography\n- **K**: Key\n- **M**: Message\n- **C**: Ciphertext\n- **S**: Substitution\n- **P**: Permutation\n\n#### Examples in Cryptography\n- **K\u0394**: A key with properties sensitive to initial conditions.\n- **M\u03a9**: A message processed by a strange attractor, indicating complex encryption.\n- **S(B*F)**: A substitution process influenced by bifurcation and fractal patterns.\n\n### Problem Formulation\n\n#### Complex Problem in Cryptography\nConsider the problem of developing a cryptographic system using chaotic maps to enhance security. The challenge is to design an encryption algorithm that leverages the unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions inherent in chaotic systems to produce highly secure ciphertext.\n\n#### Suitability for Chaotic Analysis\nChaotic systems exhibit properties like sensitivity to initial conditions and complex dynamics, making them ideal for generating cryptographic keys and encryption patterns that are difficult to predict or reverse-engineer.\n\n### Problem Representation\n\n#### Translation to Symbolic Language\n1. Define the chaotic map as **f(x) = Ax(1-x)** where A is a constant, representing the logistic map.\n2. Represent the encryption key as **K = A\u0394** meaning the key is derived from an attractor with sensitivity to initial conditions.\n3. The plaintext message **M** is represented as a series of initial conditions in the chaotic system.\n4.

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Given the task family \"mathematical_symbolic_language,\" it is important to evaluate the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task. The task requires creating a novel symbolic language based on advanced mathematical concepts (e.g., topology) and applying it to solve complex problems in another domain (e.g., quantum computing). This involves deep interdisciplinary synthesis, abstract reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and creative problem-solving.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Interdisciplinary Synthesis:** Integrating concepts from topology and quantum computing is highly challenging, even for experts in these fields, due to the specific and sophisticated knowledge required.\n2. **Abstract Reasoning and Symbolic Manipulation:** Developing a novel symbolic language and using it to represent and solve complex problems demands a high level of abstraction and the ability to manipulate symbolic representations effectively.\n3. **Creative Problem-Solving:** The task requires not just understanding existing theories but also creating new ways to represent and solve problems, which is a significant intellectual endeavor.\n\n### Evaluation of LLM Capabilities:\n- **Current LLM Strengths:** LLMs have shown proficiency in understanding and generating text related to specific domains, performing symbolic manipulations, and generating creative outputs based on provided patterns or examples.\n- **Challenges for LLMs:** Despite their strengths, LLMs might struggle with creating entirely new symbolic systems and applying them to very complex, interdisciplinary problems due to the depth of understanding and originality required.\n\n### Task Evaluation:\n- **Evaluation Method:** The task is scored using the `eval_with_llm_judge` function, which assesses the response based on predefined criteria focusing on depth of understanding, creativity, coherence, and effective problem-solving.\n- **Suitability of LLM Judge:** An LLM judge, while capable of evaluating text-based criteria, might not fully grasp the originality and interdisciplinary depth required for this task, potentially leading to an inaccurate assessment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the very high difficulty and the depth of interdisciplinary knowledge required for this task, it is surprising and noteworthy that the LLM agent succeeded. This success suggests a level of capability that goes beyond typical expectations for current LLMs in handling complex and creative interdisciplinary tasks.\n\nDecision: Yes"
