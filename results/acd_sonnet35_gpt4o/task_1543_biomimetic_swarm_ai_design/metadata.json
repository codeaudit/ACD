            "## 1. Biological Inspiration\n\n### a) Key Collective Behaviors and Decision-making Processes\nHoneybees exhibit remarkable collective behaviors and decision-making processes that are central to their survival and efficiency. One key behavior is their foraging strategy, where scout bees search for food sources and communicate their findings through the waggle dance. This dance encodes information about the direction, distance, and quality of the food source. The colony then collectively decides which sources to exploit based on this shared information. Another critical behavior is their swarm intelligence when bees decide on a new nest site.

Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.\n\nImportant: Address all parts of the task thoroughly, ensuring that your response is specific to the given insect species, optimization problem, constraint, and scale.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1200-1550 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of {t['insect_species']}' collective behavior and its relevance to {t['optimization_problem']} at the scale of a {t['scale']}.\",\n            f\"The AI system architecture is well-designed, innovative, and clearly mimics or adapts the biological processes of {t['insect_species']}.\",\n            f\"The problem-solving approach is well-explained and addresses the constraint of {t['constraint']} effectively.\",\n            \"The analysis of scaling, adaptation, and performance evaluation is thorough and scientifically sound.\",\n            \"The discussion of ethical and societal implications is insightful and comprehensive.\",\n            \"The proposed future research directions are novel and promising.\",\n            \"The overall response shows a high level of interdisciplinary knowledge integration and creative problem-solving.\",\n            \"All parts of the task are addressed thoroughly and specifically.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task's complexity and the high level of interdisciplinary knowledge required, I will reason through the capabilities of current LLMs and the evaluation process:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**:\n   - LLMs are trained on vast datasets that include interdisciplinary knowledge. They can often articulate concepts from biology, AI, and optimization independently.\n   \n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**:\n   - LLMs can generate creative solutions by combining existing knowledge in novel ways, although true innovation and deep integration across domains are challenging.\n\n3. **Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems and Swarm Intelligence**:\n   - LLMs can describe principles of swarm intelligence and complex adaptive systems based on training data, but applying these principles to design a novel AI system is a higher-order task.\n\n4. **Evaluating System Design and Implementation**:\n   - The task requires not just theoretical knowledge but also a practical, plausible design. LLMs might struggle with the detailed implementation and ensuring scientific plausibility.\n\n5. **Ethical and Societal Implications**:\n   - LLMs can discuss ethical considerations based on learned patterns, though depth and originality might be limited.\n\n6. **Task Evaluation by an LLM Judge**:\n   - The task's scoring relies on another LLM evaluating the submission against detailed criteria. This may introduce challenges, such as the evaluating LLM's ability to fully appreciate novel interdisciplinary integration and creative problem-solving.\n\nGiven these considerations, the successful completion of this highly complex and interdisciplinary task by an LLM is indeed surprising and noteworthy. The agent's ability to integrate diverse fields, propose a novel AI architecture, and address all specified points thoroughly is beyond typical expectations for current LLM capabilities.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
