In classical models, electrostatic interactions are typically calculated using Coulomb\u2019s Law, assuming point charges. However, quantum entanglement allows for the consideration of non-local interactions where the state of one particle instantaneously affects another, regardless of distance. This property can be harnessed to model the dynamic and complex electrostatic environment within a folding protein. By representing amino acid residues as quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition and entangled states, we can simulate highly correlated electrostatic interactions more accurately.\n\n#### Key Components and Structure\n\n1. **Qubits Representation**: Each amino acid is represented as a qubit, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.\n2. **Entanglement**: Entanglement is used to model the correlated states between amino acids that are spatially close or have significant electrostatic interactions.\n3. **Quantum Gates**: Quantum gates are applied to simulate the interactions and transformations of the protein folding process.\n4. **Hamiltonian**: The system's Hamiltonian incorporates both quantum mechanical terms and classical electrostatic terms to describe the energy states of the protein.\n\n#### Enhancing Understanding of Protein Folding\n\nIntegrating quantum entanglement into the simulation of electrostatic interactions allows us to capture the non-local, correlated nature of these interactions more precisely.

Future Directions (100-150 words):\n   a) Suggest areas for future research or refinement of your model.\n   b) Propose how your approach could be extended to other aspects of molecular biology.\n   c) Speculate on potential long-term impacts of quantum-inspired biological simulations.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, molecular biology, and computational modeling. Be creative and innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility. Use technical terminology appropriately and provide explanations where necessary.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1050-1350 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of both quantum mechanics and molecular biology\",\n            \"The proposed model creatively integrates the specified quantum concept with the given protein folding property\",\n            \"The mathematical formulation and simulation algorithm are well-explained and scientifically plausible\",\n            \"The potential applications and future directions are innovative and relevant\",\n            \"The response addresses technical challenges and proposes reasonable solutions\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the detailed nature of the task, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: The task involves integrating quantum mechanics principles with molecular biology, specifically in the context of protein folding. This requires a deep understanding of both fields, which is generally a challenging expectation for most LLMs.\n\n2. **Abstract Reasoning and Creative Problem-Solving**: The task demands not only understanding the concepts but also creatively combining them into a coherent and scientifically plausible model. This level of creativity and abstract reasoning is typically beyond the capabilities of most LLMs.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Scientific Plausibility**: The task requires detailed explanations, mathematical formulations, and algorithms that are scientifically plausible. It is a high bar for an LLM to meet these requirements accurately.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring method uses another LLM to evaluate the responses based on specific criteria. This secondary LLM must assess deep understanding, creativity, and scientific plausibility, which adds another layer of complexity and potential variability.\n\nGiven the above factors, the task is extremely challenging and combines multiple high-difficulty elements. The success of an LLM agent at this task would suggest a significant leap in the capabilities of LLMs, particularly in terms of interdisciplinary knowledge integration, creativity, and deep technical understanding.\n\nDecision: Yes"
