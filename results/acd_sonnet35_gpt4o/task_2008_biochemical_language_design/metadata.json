            "1. Language Design\n\na) The language, which we'll call \"Synthese,\" incorporates key elements of protein synthesis by mirroring the stages of transcription and translation. DNA sequences represent fundamental ideas or concepts, which are transcribed into mRNA sequences (sentences) and then translated into proteins (meaningful expressions). Each nucleotide base (A, T, C, G) corresponds to a phoneme, and triplets (codons) form words.\n\nb) The five fundamental 'parts of speech' are:\n   - Codons: Represent nouns and are the building blocks of sentences.\n   - Ribosomes: Act as verbs, indicating actions or processes.\n   - Amino acids: Serve as adjectives, providing descriptions or qualities.\n   - tRNA molecules: Function as prepositions, showing relationships between concepts.\n   - Polypeptides: Act as conjunctions, linking clauses or sentences.\n\nc) Basic grammar and syntax rules in Synthese follow the linear progression of protein synthesis. Sentences start with a promoter sequence (capital letter) and end with a stop codon (period). The order is subject (codon/noun) + process (ribosome/verb) + quality (amino acid/adjective) + relationship (tRNA/preposition) + linkage (polypeptide/conjunction).\n\nCommon concepts:\n   - Action: Transcription (e.g., DNA to mRNA)\n   - Description: Amino acid properties (e.g., hydrophobic)\n   - Time: Sequence of ribosomal movement (e.g., elongation)\n\n2. Vocabulary Generation\n\na) Mini-lexicon:\n   - ATG: Earth\n   - TGA: Pollution\n   - CGA: Temperature\n   - TAC: Increase\n   - GAT: Decrease\n   - ACC: Air\n   - GGC: Water\n   - GTT: Human\n   - CCA: Change\n   - AGG: Energy\n\nb) Biochemical basis:\n   - ATG (Earth): Start codon, signifying the beginning of life.\n   - TGA (Pollution): Stop codon, signifying detrimental effects.\n   - CGA (Temperature): Codon related to stability.\n   - TAC (Increase): Codon for growth.\n   - GAT (Decrease): Codon for reduction.\n   - ACC (Air): Codon for essential elements.\n   - GGC (Water): Codon for vital resources.\n   - GTT (Human): Codon for living organisms.\n   - CCA (Change): Codon for adaptation.\n   - AGG (Energy): Codon for metabolic processes.\n\nc) Combining words:\n   - ATG TAC (Earth increase): Global warming.\n   - GTT TGA (Human pollution): Anthropogenic pollution.\n   - CGA GAT (Temperature decrease): Cooling.\n\n3. Phenomenon Description\n\na) Synthese description:\n   - \"ATG CCA ACC TAC, GTT TGA GGC AGG CGA.\"\nb) English translation:\n   - \"Earth changes air increase, humans pollute water energy temperature.\"\nc) The unique structure of Synthese mirrors the sequential and interconnected nature of biochemical processes, offering an intuitive understanding of how various factors in climate change interrelate.\n\n4. Linguistic Analysis\n\na) Synthese shapes thinking by emphasizing sequential, process-oriented views of phenomena, akin to the step-by-step nature of biochemical reactions. This could foster a more systematic approach to problem-solving.\nb) Unlike natural languages that often rely on context, Synthese\u2019s rigid structure and predefined relationships reduce ambiguity, providing clarity in scientific descriptions.\nc) Limitations include its rigidity and potential difficulty in expressing abstract ideas. However, its systematic nature makes it advantageous for scientific accuracy.\n\n5. Interdisciplinary Connections\n\na) Synthese can be applied in scientific research to model complex systems or in education to teach biochemical processes through language learning. It can enhance understanding by paralleling biological mechanisms.\nb) An experiment could involve using Synthese to teach protein synthesis to students and comparing their test scores and problem-solving approaches with those taught using traditional methods. This would assess whether thinking in Synthese improves comprehension and application in biochemistry.",
            "1. Language Design:\na) My hypothetical language, Synthesese, is designed around the process of protein synthesis, incorporating elements like transcription, translation, and amino acid sequences. In Synthesese, the formation of sentences parallels the stages of protein synthesis, where mRNA (messenger RNA) represents the communicated message, and tRNA (transfer RNA) acts as interpreters that bring amino acids (words) together to form proteins (sentences).\n\nb) Fundamental \u2018parts of speech\u2019:\n- Codons: These are akin to nouns and represent entities or objects (e.g., water, tree).\n- Anticodons: These act like verbs, linking actions to the nouns (e.g., grow, melt).\n- Promoters: Function as conjunctions and prepositions, initiating or linking sequences (e.g., in, before).\n- Terminators: Act as punctuation marks, indicating the end of a sentence or thought (e.g., period, comma).\n- Ribosomes: These are comparable to subjects, driving the process of sentence formation (e.g., the Earth, the Sun).\n\nc) Grammar and Syntax Rules:\nSynthesese sentences begin with a Promoter, followed by a Ribosome (subject), a Codon (noun), an Anticodon (verb), and can include additional Codons or Anticodons as needed. Terminators end the sentence. For example, \"Promoter-Ribosome-Codon-Anticodon-Terminator\" translates to \"In the Earth, water melts.\"\n\nd) Common Concepts:\n- Action: Anticodons represent actions (e.g., \"GAC\" for grow).\n- Description: Modifier codons (adjectives/adverbs) are added before nouns/verbs (e.g., \"UGG\" for hot).\n- Time: Temporal promoters set the time context (e.g., \"AUG\" for now).\n\n2. Vocabulary Generation:\na) Mini-lexicon:\n- \"AUG\" (Promoter): Now\n- \"UAA\" (Terminator): End\n- \"GGC\" (Codon): Water\n- \"CGA\" (Codon): Tree\n- \"GAC\" (Anticodon): Grow\n- \"UAC\" (Anticodon): Melt\n- \"UUG\" (Promoter): Before\n- \"UGG\" (Modifier): Hot\n- \"AAC\" (Modifier): Cold\n- \"GCU\" (Ribosome): Earth\n\nb) Biochemical Basis:\nEach word or phrase in Synthesese is modeled after codon sequences in mRNA, with combinations reflecting the specificity of amino acid coding in proteins. For example, \"AUG\" (Now) is the start codon in mRNA, initiating translation.\n\nc) Complex Expressions:\n\"UUG GCU CGA GAC UAA\" translates to \"Before Earth tree grows end.\"\n\"UGG GGC UAC UAA\" translates to \"Hot water melts end.\"\n\n3. Phenomenon Description:\na) Synthesese Description:\n\"UUG GCU AAC GGC UAC UAA.\"\n\"UUG GCU CGA GAC UAA.\"\n\"AUG GCU CGA UAC UAA.\"\n\nb) English Translation:\n\"Before Earth cold water melts end.\"\n\"Before Earth tree grows end.\"\n\"Now Earth tree melts end.\"\n\nc) Unique Features:\nSynthesese uses specific codonic sequences to represent complex ideas concisely, highlighting the processes and interactions within climate change. For example, using \"UUG\" (before) and \"AUG\" (now) emphasizes temporal shifts crucial in climate discussions.\n\n4. Linguistic Analysis:\na) Shaping Thinking:\nSynthesese encourages thinking about climate change through a process-oriented lens, focusing on interactions and sequences, mirroring biochemical pathways. This can foster a deeper understanding of cause-effect relationships.\n\nb) Comparison with Natural Languages:\nUnlike natural languages, Synthesese is linear and systematic, reducing ambiguity. Its precision can enhance scientific communication but may lack the expressiveness of natural languages in conveying nuanced emotions.\n\nc) Limitations and Advantages:\nSynthesese is advantageous for scientific precision and clarity but may be limited in everyday communication due to its rigidity. Its structure is ideal for abstract and logical thinking, crucial in scientific contexts.\n\n5. Interdisciplinary Connections:\na) Applications:\nSynthesese can be used in bioinformatics to model genetic processes or in educational tools to teach protein synthesis. It can bridge language and science, making complex concepts accessible.\n\nb) Proposed Experiment:\nDesign an experiment where students learn biochemistry concepts in Synthesese and traditional language. Compare their problem-solving efficiency and retention of biochemical processes to determine if Synthesese enhances understanding or recall.",
            "**1. Language Design**\n\na) My hypothetical language, \"Syntheto,\" is based on the process of protein synthesis. In protein synthesis, DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein. Syntheto mirrors this by representing ideas as \"genes\" (DNA sequences), which are transcribed into \"messages\" (mRNA) and then translated into \"actions\" (proteins). \n\nb) Five fundamental parts of speech in Syntheto:\n- **Genes (Nouns)**: Represent subjects or objects. Just as genes contain information, these words carry the main topic or entity of a sentence.\n- **Promoters (Verbs)**: Represent actions or processes. In biochemistry, promoters initiate transcription; similarly, these words initiate actions in Syntheto.\n- **Codons (Adjectives)**: Modify genes (nouns) by providing specific characteristics, similar to how codons code for specific amino acids.\n- **Anticodons (Adverbs)**: Modify promoters (verbs), providing context or manner, akin to how anticodons pair with codons during translation.\n- **Introns (Conjunctions)**: Connect different parts of a sentence, analogous to how introns are non-coding regions that are spliced out but help in splicing process.\n\nc) Grammar and syntax in Syntheto follow a structure similar to protein synthesis:\n- **Sentence Structure**: Gene + Promoter + (Codon) + (Anticodon) + (Intron).\n- **Transcription/Translation**: Concepts are first \"transcribed\" into a basic mRNA-like structure (subject + action), then \"translated\" into a full sentence with modifiers.\n- **Temporal and Descriptive Phrases**: Time is expressed with \"Poly-A tails\" at the end of sentences, indicating duration or frequency.\n\nExamples:\n- Action: \"Transcribe\" means to start an action.\n- Description: \"Mutate\" can describe something changing over time.\n\n**2. Vocabulary Generation**\n\na) Mini-lexicon:\n- Gene: \"Clima\" (Climate)\n- Promoter: \"Transcribe\" (Initiate)\n- Codon: \"Mutate\" (Change)\n- Anticodon: \"Rapidly\" (Quickly)\n- Intron: \"And\" (Connects)\n- Poly-A tail: \"Chrono\" (Time)\n- Gene: \"Carbon\" (Carbon)\n- Promoter: \"Emit\" (Release)\n- Codon: \"Dense\" (Thick)\n- Anticodon: \"Globally\" (Worldwide)\n\nb) Biochemical basis:\n- \"Clima\" is DNA that codes for the overall concept of climate.\n- \"Transcribe\" initiates the action, like transcription in cells.\n- \"Mutate\" provides specificity, indicating the changing nature of climate.\n- \"Rapidly\" modifies the rate of change.\n- \"And\" connects clauses, similar to how introns are involved in gene splicing.\n\nc) Complex expressions:\n- \"Clima Transcribe Mutate Rapidly\" (The climate changes quickly).\n- \"Carbon Emit Dense Globally\" (Carbon is released densely worldwide).\n\n**3. Phenomenon Description**\n\na) Description in Syntheto:\n\"Clima Transcribe Mutate Chrono, Carbon Emit Dense Globally Chrono Intron Greenhouse Transcribe Trap Heat.\"\n\nb) English translation:\n\"The climate changes over time, carbon is released densely worldwide over time, and the greenhouse effect traps heat.\"\n\nc) Language features:\n- Using \"Transcribe\" and \"Emit\" for actions ties the phenomenon to dynamic processes.\n- \"Mutate\" and \"Trap\" highlight the changing and capturing aspects, akin to mutation and binding in biochemistry.\n- \"Chrono\" expresses temporal aspects, emphasizing the ongoing nature of climate change.\n\n**4. Linguistic Analysis**\n\na) Syntheto shapes thinking by framing climate change as a dynamic, ongoing process, using terms from biochemistry that imply constant activity and transformation. This could help emphasize the urgency and complexity of climate change.\n\nb) Compared to natural languages, Syntheto's biochemical basis provides a unique perspective, making abstract concepts more tangible by relating them to known biological processes. However, it may lack the emotional nuance and cultural references found in natural languages.\n\nc) Limitations include potential difficulty in expressing non-scientific ideas or poetic language. Advantages include clear, process-oriented descriptions ideal for scientific discourse.\n\n**5. Interdisciplinary Connections**\n\na) Potential applications include using Syntheto in educational settings to teach both biochemistry and climate science simultaneously. It could also be used in scientific research to model complex processes.\n\nb) An experiment could involve two groups solving biochemistry problems: one using Syntheto and one using a natural language. Comparing their performance could reveal whether thinking in Syntheto aids in understanding and solving biochemical problems, potentially showing its utility in enhancing cognitive processes related to scientific thinking.",
            "### 1. Language Design\n\n**a) Incorporating Protein Synthesis Elements:**\nThe language, called \"Synthesean,\" mirrors the process of protein synthesis by using a three-step structure: transcription, translation, and folding. Words are \"transcribed\" from a conceptual 'DNA' template, \"translated\" into another form to represent their function, and \"folded\" to create sentences.\n\n**b) Fundamental Parts of Speech:**\n1. **Codon-Verbs:** Represent actions, analogous to codons that code for amino acids.\n2. **Amino-Descriptors:** Adjectives that describe properties, akin to amino acids that determine protein characteristics.\n3. **Ribo-Connectors:** Linking words, similar to ribosomes that facilitate the connection between mRNA and tRNA.\n4. **tRNA-Nouns:** Entities or subjects, comparable to tRNA molecules that bring amino acids to the ribosome.\n5. **Enzyme-Adverbs:** Modify actions, like enzymes that alter the rates of biochemical reactions.\n\n**c) Grammar and Syntax:**\nSynthesean follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure. Sentences must start with a tRNA-Noun, followed by a Codon-Verb, and conclude with another tRNA-Noun or Amino-Descriptor. Ribo-Connectors link clauses, and Enzyme-Adverbs modify Codon-Verbs.\n\n**d) Concept Expression:**\n- **Action:** Codon-Verbs like \"bind\" (AUG) are central to describing actions.\n- **Description:** Amino-Descriptors such as \"polar\" (Glycine) describe properties.\n- **Time:** Temporal aspects are managed by specialized Enzyme-Adverbs, e.g., \"immediately\" (Polymerase).\n\n### 2.

Phenomenon Description\n\n**a) Synthesean Description:**\n```\ntRNA-Met AUG tRNA-Met Glycine. tRNA-Met RNA Polymerase AUG ATP. Ribosome AUG tRNA-Met Hydrogen Bond.\n```\n\n**b) English Translation:**\n```\nEarth binds Earth polar. Earth initiates binding energy. Connects Earth stability.\n```\n\n**c) Language Features:**\nSynthesean's use of biochemical terms allows for precise, layered descriptions, such as describing climate effects by referencing molecular stability and energy dynamics.\n\n### 4. Linguistic Analysis\n\n**a) Shaping Thinking:**\nSynthesean encourages thinking in terms of processes and interactions rather than static states, aligning with how biochemical processes unfold.\n\n**b) Comparison with Natural Languages:**\nNatural languages may lack the inherent process-oriented nature of Synthesean, making Synthesean more suitable for describing dynamic systems like climate change.\n\n**c) Limitations and Advantages:**\nWhile Synthesean's specificity aids scientific thinking, it could be cumbersome for everyday use. Its structured nature, however, promotes clear, system-based reasoning.\n\n### 5. Interdisciplinary Connections\n\n**a) Applications:**\nSynthesean could be used to teach complex biochemical processes by illustrating them in a familiar linguistic framework. It could also aid in modeling environmental systems.\n\n**b) Experiment Proposal:**\nAn experiment could involve two groups solving biochemical problems: one using Synthesean and the other using natural language. Comparing their performance could reveal if Synthesean's process-oriented structure enhances problem-solving capabilities in biochemistry.",

Linguistic Analysis:\n\na) Shaping Thinking:\nSynthesese emphasizes the process-oriented nature of climate change, focusing on the sequence of events rather than isolated phenomena. This could foster a more holistic understanding of the interconnected factors driving climate change.\n\nb) Comparison with Natural Languages:\nNatural languages often describe climate change in discrete terms (e.g., CO2 levels, temperature rise).

Your response should include:\n\n1. Language Design (300-350 words):\n   a) Explain how your language incorporates key elements of protein synthesis.\n   b) Define at least 5 fundamental 'parts of speech' in your language, relating each to a specific aspect of the biochemical process.\n   c) Describe the basic grammar and syntax rules, drawing parallels to biochemical mechanisms.\n   d) Provide examples of how common concepts (e.g., action, description, time) are expressed in your language.\n\n2. Vocabulary Generation (200-250 words):\n   a) Create a mini-lexicon of at least 10 words or phrases in your language, with their English translations.\n   b) Explain the biochemical basis for each word or phrase.\n   c) Demonstrate how these words can be combined to form more complex expressions.\n\n3. Phenomenon Description (250-300 words):\n   a) Use your biochemical language to describe the phenomenon of climate change.\n   b) Provide both the description in your invented language and an English translation.\n   c) Explain how specific features of your language allow for unique or insightful ways of describing this phenomenon.\n\n4. Linguistic Analysis (200-250 words):\n   a) Analyze how your language might shape thinking about climate change.\n   b) Compare your language's approach to describing this phenomenon with that of natural languages.\n   c) Discuss any limitations or advantages of your language for scientific or abstract thinking.\n\n5. Interdisciplinary Connections (150-200 words):\n   a) Explore potential applications of your biochemical language in scientific research or education.\n   b) Propose an experiment to test whether thinking in your language affects problem-solving in biochemistry or related fields.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of both protein synthesis and linguistic principles.

Use appropriate terminology from biochemistry and linguistics throughout your answer.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response includes a detailed design of a language based on {t['biochemical_process']} with at least 5 parts of speech and clear grammar rules.\",\n            \"A mini-lexicon of at least 10 words or phrases is provided with explanations of their biochemical basis.\",\n            f\"The phenomenon of {t['phenomenon_to_describe']} is described using the invented language, with an English translation and explanation.\",\n            \"The response includes an analysis of how the language might shape thinking and compares it to natural languages.\",\n            \"Potential applications and an experiment to test the language's effects on problem-solving are proposed.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "The task family \"biochemical_language_design\" is an exceptionally complex and interdisciplinary task that requires the LLM to integrate advanced knowledge from biochemistry, linguistics, and environmental science, while also demonstrating creative language design and abstract reasoning capabilities. Given the high estimated human difficulty and the multi-faceted nature of the task, it would be quite challenging for an LLM to succeed comprehensively.\n\nHowever, LLMs, particularly advanced models, have demonstrated capabilities in generating creative and coherent text, understanding and applying specialized knowledge from various domains, and performing complex reasoning tasks to some extent. Therefore, while this task is demanding, an advanced LLM's success isn't entirely beyond expectation if the model has been trained on extensive and diverse datasets and has advanced reasoning abilities.\n\nThe evaluation criteria involve detailed and multi-part requirements, and the LLM judge needs to assess nuanced and interdisciplinary responses. If the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it indicates that the model can effectively handle highly complex, interdisciplinary problems and generate coherent, creative, and scientifically plausible responses.\n\nHowever, considering the need for deep integration of specialized knowledge and creative thinking, the success of the LLM agent in this task is indeed noteworthy. The complexity and the requirement for novel language design based on biochemical processes make this a particularly challenging task, where success would be surprising and impressive from the perspective of a human evaluator.\n\nDecision: Yes"
