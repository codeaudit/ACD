            "## 1. Problem Analysis\n\n### a) Classical Approaches\nThe problem of Cryptographic Hash Function Inversion involves finding an input that produces a specific hash output. Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be one-way, meaning it\u2019s computationally challenging to invert them. Classical approaches include:\n\n- **Brute Force:** Testing all possible inputs until the correct one is found. This approach has a time complexity of \\(O(2^n)\\) for an \\(n\\)-bit hash.\n- **Birthday Attack:** Exploits the birthday paradox to find collisions in \\(O(2^{n/2})\\) time for \\(n\\)-bit outputs. However, it\u2019s limited to finding collisions rather than specific pre-images.\n\n### b) Quantum Approach Benefits\nQuantum computing offers potential speedups for problems involving large search spaces. Quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm, provide quadratic speedups for unstructured search problems, reducing the time complexity from \\(O(2^n)\\) to \\(O(2^{n/2})\\).\n\n### c) Key Quantum Properties\n- **Superposition:** Allows quantum bits (qubits) to represent multiple states simultaneously.\n- **Entanglement:** Provides correlations between qubits that classical bits cannot achieve.\n- **Quantum Interference:** Enables the amplification of correct solutions while canceling out incorrect ones.\n\n## 2. Quantum Algorithm Design\n\n### a) Proposed Algorithm\nThe proposed quantum algorithm utilizes Grover's algorithm for searching the space of possible inputs to find one that produces the given hash output. The steps are:\n\n1. **Initialize:** Prepare a superposition of all possible inputs.\n2. **Oracle:** Construct an oracle that marks states corresponding to inputs that produce the given hash output.\n3. **Grover Iteration:** Apply the Grover iteration, which involves the oracle, a phase inversion, and a diffusion operator.\n4. **Measurement:** Measure the quantum state to obtain the input producing the given hash output.\n\n### b) Quantum Operations and Gates\n- **Hadamard Gates (H):** Create superpositions.\n- **Oracle (U_f):** Implemented as a quantum circuit that flips the phase of states corresponding to correct inputs.\n- **Diffusion Operator (D):** Inverts around the mean amplitude.\n- **Measurement:** Collapses the quantum state to a classical result.\n\n### c) Leveraging Quantum Properties\nThe algorithm leverages superposition to represent all possible inputs simultaneously and interference to amplify correct solutions and suppress incorrect ones.\n\n### d) Pseudocode\n```plaintext\n1. Initialize |\u03c8\u27e9 = H^n |0\u27e9^n\n2. Repeat O(2^(n/2)) times:\n    a. Apply the oracle U_f\n    b. Apply the diffusion operator D\n3. Measure the state |\u03c8\u27e9\n```\n\n### e) Novelty\nThe novelty lies in the customized oracle for the specific hash function, optimizing the Grover iteration for cryptographic hash inversion. Unlike generic implementations, this design addresses specific hash function characteristics.\n\n## 3. Complexity Analysis\n\n### a) Time and Space Complexity\n- **Time Complexity:** Grover\u2019s algorithm runs in \\(O(2^{n/2})\\) time, significantly faster than classical brute force.\n- **Space Complexity:** Requires \\(O(n)\\) qubits to represent the superposition of \\(n\\)-bit inputs.\n\n### b) Comparison to Classical Algorithms\nClassical brute force has a time complexity of \\(O(2^n)\\). The quantum algorithm achieves a quadratic speedup with \\(O(2^{n/2})\\) complexity, making it exponentially faster for large \\(n\\).\n\n### c) Mathematical Speedup Analysis\nThe quadratic speedup is derived from Grover\u2019s algorithm, where the number of iterations is \\(O(2^{n/2})\\), compared to \\(O(2^n)\\) for classical search.\n\n### d) Limitations\n- **Quantum Noise:** Current quantum devices are prone to errors and decoherence.\n- **Oracle Construction:** Efficiently constructing the oracle for specific hash functions can be complex.\n\n## 4.
