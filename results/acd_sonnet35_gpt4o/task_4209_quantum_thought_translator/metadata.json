Thought Capture and Processing\n\n### a) Capturing Visual Imagery\nThe system uses non-invasive BCIs to detect brain activity in regions associated with visual processing (e.g., occipital lobe). Functional MRI or EEG technologies map the visual imagery to neural patterns.\n\n### b) Processing and Interpretation\nThe captured signals are processed using machine learning algorithms to decode the neural activity into structured data representing the visual imagery. Quantum Annealing helps optimize this decoding by finding the best match between the neural patterns and known visual representations.\n\n### c) Novel Quantum Algorithms\n- **Quantum Pattern Matching:** Matches neural activity patterns to semantic constructs.\n- **Quantum State Reduction:** Reduces noise and enhances signal clarity.\n- **Quantum Annealing Optimization:** Finds the optimal translation pathway from neural patterns to linguistic output.\n\n## 3.

Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1350-1650 words.\n\nExample: For translating 'Emotional States' into 'Arabic' using 'Quantum Entanglement', you might describe a system that uses entangled qubits to represent complex emotional states and their linguistic correlates in Arabic, allowing for instantaneous translation of nuanced feelings.\n\nNOTE: The word count requirement (1350-1650 words) is crucial and will be strictly evaluated.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response must include a well-designed theoretical quantum computing system for thought translation\",\n            f\"The system should specifically address translating {t['thought_type']} into {t['language']}\",\n            f\"The quantum principle of {t['quantum_principle']} should be clearly utilized and explained in the design\",\n            \"The response should demonstrate interdisciplinary knowledge integration of quantum computing, neuroscience, and linguistics\",\n            \"The analysis should include thoughtful consideration of ethical implications and propose specific safeguards\",\n            \"The response should adhere to the required word count (1350-1650 words) and formatting guidelines\",\n            \"The proposed system should be innovative while maintaining scientific plausibility\",\n            \"All six required sections should be present and adequately addressed\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given my understanding of the capabilities and limitations of current large language models (LLMs), let's analyze this task.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: This task requires the integration of quantum computing, neuroscience, linguistics, and ethical reasoning. While LLMs have access to vast amounts of information on these subjects, integrating them into a coherent and scientifically plausible design is highly complex.\n   \n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: The task demands a high degree of creativity to design a theoretical system that doesn't currently exist. LLMs are capable of generating creative content, but the novelty and depth required for this task are substantial.\n\n3. **Understanding Quantum Computing and Neuroscience**: These are highly specialized fields. While LLMs can generate text on these topics, truly understanding and innovatively applying principles from these fields is challenging.\n\n4. **Ethical and Societal Implications**: Discussing ethical considerations and societal impacts requires nuanced understanding and reasoning, which, although within the capabilities of LLMs to some degree, is still a difficult area.\n\n5. **Word Count and Structure**: Maintaining coherence and adhering to specific word count requirements while covering all sections comprehensively is a significant challenge for LLMs.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the high level of difficulty and the requirement for deep interdisciplinary integration and creative problem-solving, it is not surprising that the LLM agent failed at this task. Current LLMs, while impressive, often struggle with tasks that demand highly specialized knowledge and the ability to innovatively integrate multiple complex domains.\n\n**Decision: No**"
