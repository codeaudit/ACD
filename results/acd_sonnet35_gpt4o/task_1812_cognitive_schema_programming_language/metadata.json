Given the success of interdisciplinary tasks, I'm considering combining elements of linguistics, psychology, and computer science to create a task that challenges the model's ability to understand and manipulate abstract concepts across these fields. \n\nThe task I'm proposing will focus on designing a programming language based on cognitive schemas and mental models. This will require the model to demonstrate understanding of human cognition, programming language design, and the ability to translate abstract psychological concepts into concrete computational structures. \n\nI believe this task will be particularly challenging and novel, as it requires not just knowledge of multiple fields, but the ability to creatively synthesize concepts across them. The estimated difficulty would be very high (5 out of 5) due to the complex interdisciplinary nature of the task and the level of abstract thinking required.\n\nI will use an LLM judge for scoring, as the evaluation of such a creative and complex task would benefit from nuanced understanding and assessment.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"cognitive_schema_programming_language\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design a programming language based on cognitive schemas and mental models, then use it to solve a problem in artificial cognition\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary synthesis, abstract reasoning, and creative problem-solving in cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        cognitive_schemas = [\\n            {\\n                \\\"schema\\\": \\\"Script schema\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Represents sequences of events or actions\\\",\\n                \\\"example\\\": \\\"The process of ordering food at a restaurant\\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"schema\\\": \\\"Categorization schema\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Organizes objects or concepts into categories\\\",\\n                \\\"example\\\": \\\"Classifying animals into mammals, reptiles, birds, etc.\\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"schema\\\": \\\"Spatial schema\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Represents spatial relationships and navigation\\\",\\n                \\\"example\\\": \\\"Mental map of your hometown\\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"schema\\\": \\\"Causal schema\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Represents cause-and-effect relationships\\\",\\n                \\\"example\\\": \\\"Understanding how weather patterns affect crop growth\\\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        \\n        cognitive_problems = [\\n            \\\"Implement a decision-making algorithm for an autonomous robot\\\",\\n            \\\"Design a system for natural language understanding in AI\\\",\\n            \\\"Create a model for emotion recognition in human-computer interaction\\\",\\n            \\\"Develop an adaptive learning system for personalized education\\\"\\n        ]\\n        \\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"schema\\\": random.choice(cognitive_schemas),\\n                \\\"problem\\\": random.choice(cognitive_problems)\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"schema\\\": random.choice(cognitive_schemas),\\n                \\\"problem\\\": random.choice(cognitive_problems)\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"Design a programming language based on the cognitive schema of {t['schema']['schema']} ({t['schema']['description']}).

Then, use your language to solve the following problem in artificial cognition: Develop an adaptive learning system for personalized education\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\n1. Language Design (300-350 words):\n   a) Describe the key features and syntax of your programming language, including at least three unique constructs that reflect the Script schema.\n   b) Explain how your language incorporates the principles of the Script schema, providing specific examples of how cognitive processes are represented.\n   c) Provide a code snippet (5-10 lines) demonstrating a basic operation in your language, with comments explaining each line.\n   d) Discuss how your language differs from traditional programming languages, highlighting at least two major distinctions.\n\n2. Problem Solution (250-300 words):\n   a) Present a high-level algorithm or pseudocode (at least 10 steps) to solve the given problem using your language.\n   b) Explain how your solution leverages at least two unique features of your language.\n   c) Discuss any challenges you anticipate in implementing this solution and propose approaches to overcome them.\n\n3. Cognitive Analysis (200-250 words):\n   a) Analyze how your language might influence problem-solving and cognitive processes, providing at least one concrete example.\n   b) Discuss two potential advantages and two limitations of using a schema-based language for artificial cognition.\n   c) Propose a detailed experiment to test the cognitive effects of using your language, including hypothesis, methodology, and expected outcomes.\n\n4. Interdisciplinary Implications (150-200 words):\n   a) Explore how your language might be applied in two other fields (e.g., psychology, education, or neuroscience), providing specific use cases.\n   b) Discuss at least two potential ethical considerations in developing cognitive schema-based programming languages.\n   c) Suggest a future research direction that could emerge from this work, outlining potential objectives and methodologies.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of cognitive science, programming language design, and artificial intelligence.

            "content": "Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task family \"cognitive_schema_programming_language,\" a successful performance by the LLM agent is indeed noteworthy. Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Synthesis**:\n   - The task requires integrating knowledge from cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science, which involves understanding and merging concepts from these diverse fields. This is not a trivial requirement and goes beyond the typical scope of standard LLM capabilities.\n\n2. **Abstract Reasoning and Creative Problem-Solving**:\n   - Designing a programming language based on cognitive schemas involves a high level of abstract reasoning and creativity. The LLM must formulate unique constructs that reflect cognitive processes, which demands innovative thinking and deep understanding of cognitive theory.\n\n3. **Detailed and Specific Instructions**:\n   - The task instructions are detailed and require a structured response encompassing multiple aspects: language design, problem solution, cognitive analysis, and interdisciplinary implications. Successfully addressing all these components in a coherent and scientifically plausible manner is a significant challenge.\n\n4. **Evaluation Criteria**:\n   - The evaluation criteria emphasize the incorporation of cognitive principles, relevance and coherence of code snippets, the application of the language to solve a given problem, and thoughtful analysis of cognitive and interdisciplinary impacts. Meeting these criteria satisfactorily indicates a high level of performance.\n\n5. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The estimated human difficulty is marked as very difficult, suggesting that even experts might find this task challenging. An LLM performing this task successfully would be unexpected given the complexity and depth required.\n\nTherefore, the success of the LLM agent on this task is surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
