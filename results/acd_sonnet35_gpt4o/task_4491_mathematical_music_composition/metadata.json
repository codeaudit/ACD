            "### System Architecture\n\n#### Key Components\nThe music generation system comprises several key components:\n1. **Fractal Generator**: Produces fractal patterns based on mathematical principles.\n2. **Musical Parameter Mapper**: Maps fractal data to musical parameters such as pitch, rhythm, and dynamics.\n3. **Indian Classical Music Knowledge Base**: Encodes rules and structures of Indian classical music, including ragas, talas, and ornamentations.\n4. **Timbre Manipulator**: Focuses on generating and manipulating timbre to produce a variety of sound textures.\n5. **Composition Engine**: Integrates all inputs to generate coherent musical compositions.\n6. **User Interface**: Allows users to input preferences and interact with the system.\n\n#### Incorporating Fractals\nFractals are incorporated into the system through the Fractal Generator. This component uses algorithms such as the Mandelbrot set or Julia set to produce self-similar patterns. These patterns are then translated into musical parameters using the Musical Parameter Mapper. The repetitive and recursive nature of fractals lends itself well to creating complex, evolving musical structures.\n\n#### Integrating Indian Classical Musical Knowledge\nThe system uses a comprehensive database of Indian classical music, including the structure of ragas, which are melodic frameworks, and talas, which are rhythmic cycles. The Composition Engine uses this database to ensure that the generated music adheres to the rules and aesthetics of Indian classical music.\n\n#### Focusing on Timbre\nThe Timbre Manipulator uses sound synthesis techniques to create and alter the timbre of the music. It can generate different instrumental sounds, modify existing ones, and apply effects like reverb and delay. This component ensures the richness and diversity of sound textures in the composition.\n\n#### High-Level Diagram\n```\n[User Interface]\n       |\n       V\n[Fractal Generator] -----> [Musical Parameter Mapper] -----> [Composition Engine] -----> [Output]\n       |                                                 |\n       V                                                 V\n[Indian Classical Music Knowledge Base]            [Timbre Manipulator]\n```\n\n### Mathematical-Musical Mapping\n\n#### Mapping Fractals to Musical Parameters\nThe Fractal Generator produces numerical sequences that are mapped to musical parameters. For example, the x-coordinates of a fractal could correspond to pitch, while the y-coordinates could correspond to rhythm. The fractal's iterative process can create variations in dynamics and articulation.\n\n#### Indian Classical Influence\nIndian classical music influences this mapping by dictating the scales (ragas) and rhythmic patterns (talas) used. The system ensures that the fractal-generated parameters fit within the framework of a chosen raga and tala. For instance, the pitches generated by the fractal are adjusted to conform to the notes of the selected raga.\n\n#### Novel Algorithms\nA novel algorithm developed for this system is the \"Raga-Conformant Fractal Mapping\" (RCFM). This algorithm adjusts fractal-derived pitches to the nearest valid notes within a raga.
