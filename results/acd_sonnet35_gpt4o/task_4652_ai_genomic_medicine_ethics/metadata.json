            "1. AI-Genomic System Design\n\n   a) Key Components and Architecture\n   The AI-driven system for personalized medicine comprises several key components: a genomic data processing unit, an AI-driven analytics engine, a patient database, and a secure communication interface. The genomic data processing unit extracts and preprocesses genetic information, particularly focusing on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The AI-driven analytics engine employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the genomic data in conjunction with other medical information, such as family history and lifestyle factors. The patient database stores comprehensive medical records securely, while the secure communication interface ensures encrypted data exchange between patients, healthcare providers, and the system.\n\n   b) Integration of Genomic Data\n   The system integrates genomic data by first sequencing the patient's DNA and identifying mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This data is then combined with electronic health records (EHRs), including clinical history, lab results, and imaging data. The AI engine employs natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from unstructured data within EHRs. By correlating genomic data with clinical outcomes, the system generates personalized risk assessments and treatment recommendations.\n\n   c) Data Privacy and Security\n   To ensure data privacy and security, the system utilizes advanced encryption methods for data storage and transmission. Access to genomic data is strictly controlled through multi-factor authentication and role-based access control (RBAC). The system complies with regulatory standards such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Additionally, anonymization and de-identification techniques are applied to the data to protect patient identity, while secure audit trails monitor access and modifications to sensitive information.\n\n2. Personalized Medicine Approach\n\n   a) Diagnosis and Treatment Approach\n   The system diagnoses Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome by identifying pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Upon detection of such mutations, the system evaluates other risk factors, including family history and lifestyle, to provide a comprehensive risk assessment. For treatment, it recommends personalized interventions, such as targeted therapies, preventive surgeries (e.g., prophylactic mastectomy), and regular screening protocols tailored to individual risk profiles.\n\n   b) Accounting for Genetic Variations\n   The system accounts for individual genetic variations by analyzing the specific mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. For instance, different mutations within these genes can confer varying levels of cancer risk. The AI engine uses a database of known mutations and their associated risks to provide precise risk stratification. Additionally, it incorporates polygenic risk scores, which consider the combined effect of multiple genetic variants, to refine the risk assessment further.\n\n   c) Example of a Personalized Treatment Plan\n   Consider a patient with the 185delAG mutation in the BRCA1 gene, known to significantly increase breast and ovarian cancer risk. The system identifies this mutation and, based on the patient's age, family history, and other risk factors, recommends an enhanced screening regimen, including annual MRI and mammography. It also suggests chemoprevention with tamoxifen and discusses the option of prophylactic mastectomy. Regular follow-ups and lifestyle modifications are integrated into the treatment plan to mitigate risk and monitor health outcomes.\n\n3. Ethical Implications and Dilemma Analysis\n\n   a) Ethical Considerations\n   The use of AI and genomic data in personalized medicine raises several ethical considerations, including informed consent, data privacy, and the potential for genetic discrimination. Ensuring that patients fully understand the implications of genetic testing and the use of AI in their care is paramount. Additionally, safeguarding genomic data against unauthorized access and misuse is critical to maintaining patient trust. There is also a risk of genetic information being used to discriminate against individuals in employment or insurance contexts, necessitating robust legal protections.\n\n   b) Duty to Warn Relatives Dilemma\n   The ethical dilemma of whether to warn relatives about genetic risk is complex. On one hand, there is a moral obligation to inform relatives who might also be at risk. On the other hand, patient confidentiality must be respected. The AI system can navigate this dilemma by incorporating an opt-in mechanism where patients can choose to share their genetic risk information with relatives. It also provides counseling services to help patients understand the importance of informing at-risk family members and supports clinicians in discussing these sensitive topics. In cases where a patient refuses to inform relatives, the system can anonymize and aggregate data to identify broader population risks without breaching individual confidentiality.\n\n   c) Potential Criticism and Counterargument\n   One potential criticism of this approach is that relying on patient consent to inform relatives might not be adequate, as some patients may still choose not to share this critical information. A counterargument is that forcing disclosure without consent could undermine trust in the healthcare system and deter individuals from undergoing genetic testing. As a compromise, the system can promote awareness and education about the benefits of sharing genetic risk information, thereby encouraging voluntary disclosure.\n\n4. Societal Impact and Future Developments\n\n   a) Impact on Healthcare Delivery and Patient Outcomes\n   The AI-driven system has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by providing highly personalized and precise medical care. By identifying individuals at high risk for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, the system enables early intervention and tailored treatment plans, leading to improved patient outcomes and potentially reducing cancer incidence and mortality rates.\n\n   b) Unintended Consequences and Mitigation\n   Potential unintended consequences include data breaches and the misuse of genetic information. To mitigate these risks, continuous monitoring of data security measures and adherence to stringent regulatory standards are essential. Additionally, there is a need to address disparities in access to genomic testing and AI-driven healthcare, ensuring that all populations benefit from these advancements.\n\n   c) Potential Improvement or Extension\n   One potential improvement is integrating real-time data from wearable health devices to monitor patients' health continuously and provide timely interventions. This extension could enhance the system's ability to detect early signs of cancer and other health issues, leading to more proactive and preventive care.\n\n   d) Research Agenda Proposal\n   A proposed research agenda to address current limitations in AI-driven personalized medicine includes investigating the ethical implications of AI in healthcare, developing more sophisticated algorithms for risk prediction, and exploring ways to enhance data security and privacy. Additionally, research should focus on understanding the social and economic barriers to accessing genomic medicine and developing strategies to overcome these challenges.\n\nWord Count: 1000 words",
            "1. AI-Genomic System Design\n\na) Key Components and Architecture: The AI-driven system for personalized medicine comprises several key components: a genomic data repository, an AI-based analytical engine, a clinical decision support system (CDSS), and a secure patient interface. The architecture includes data ingestion modules for collecting genomic data, particularly focusing on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and integrating them with electronic health records (EHRs). The AI analytical engine employs machine learning algorithms to analyze genomic and clinical data, identify patterns, and predict disease risk. The CDSS provides personalized treatment recommendations, while ensuring data privacy and security through advanced encryption and access control mechanisms.\n\nb) Integration of Genomic Data: The system integrates genomic data by extracting and processing information on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations from genetic tests. This data is combined with clinical information from EHRs, including family history, lifestyle factors, and previous diagnoses. The AI engine utilizes this comprehensive dataset to perform risk stratification, identify high-risk individuals, and generate personalized treatment plans that consider both genetic and clinical factors.\n\nc) Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount. The system employs robust encryption techniques to protect data at rest and in transit. Access controls are implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information. Additionally, the system complies with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), ensuring that patient data is handled with the highest standards of privacy and security.\n\n2. Personalized Medicine Approach\n\na) Diagnosis and Treatment: The system approaches the diagnosis and treatment of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome by leveraging AI to analyze genetic mutations, particularly BRCA1 and BRCA2. It identifies individuals at high risk and recommends appropriate screenings and preventive measures. For those diagnosed, the system suggests tailored treatment plans, considering the latest research and clinical guidelines.\n\nb) Individual Genetic Variations: The system accounts for individual genetic variations by analyzing specific mutations, such as the 185delAG mutation in the BRCA1 gene. The AI engine evaluates the impact of these mutations on cancer risk and progression, providing personalized insights into the most effective treatment options based on the patient\u2019s unique genetic profile.\n\nc) Example Treatment Plan: For a patient with the 185delAG mutation in the BRCA1 gene, the system might recommend increased surveillance, including regular mammograms and MRI scans. If cancer is detected, the system could suggest a combination of surgery (e.g., prophylactic mastectomy), chemotherapy tailored to the patient\u2019s genetic profile, and targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors. This approach, grounded in the patient\u2019s specific genetic makeup, aims to optimize outcomes and minimize adverse effects.\n\n3. Ethical Implications and Dilemma Analysis\n\na) Ethical Considerations: Using AI and genomic data in personalized medicine raises several ethical considerations, including issues of consent, data ownership, and potential biases in AI algorithms. Ensuring informed consent is critical, as patients must understand how their genomic data will be used. Data ownership and transparency are also crucial, as patients should have control over their information and be aware of how it is utilized. Addressing biases in AI algorithms is essential to prevent disparities in healthcare outcomes.\n\nb) Duty to Warn Relatives: The ethical dilemma of the duty to warn relatives about genetic risk is complex. On one hand, informing relatives about potential genetic risks could enable them to take preventive measures. On the other hand, it raises concerns about privacy and autonomy. Our AI system addresses this dilemma by incorporating a consent-based approach. Patients are encouraged to inform their relatives, and the system provides educational resources and counseling support to facilitate these conversations. In cases where patients are unwilling to disclose, the system ensures that healthcare providers are equipped to handle these situations ethically, balancing the need to protect patient confidentiality with the potential benefits of informing at-risk relatives.\n\nc) Potential Criticism: One potential criticism of this approach is that it places the burden of disclosure on the patient, which may not always be feasible or fair. To address this, the system could include an optional feature where patients can consent to have the system notify relatives anonymously. This ensures that relatives are informed without compromising the patient\u2019s autonomy and privacy.\n\n4. Societal Impact and Future Developments\n\na) Impact on Healthcare Delivery: The implementation of this AI-driven system has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling early detection and personalized treatment of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome. This can lead to improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and more efficient use of medical resources. Patients benefit from tailored treatment plans that consider their unique genetic and clinical profiles, leading to more effective and less invasive interventions.\n\nb) Unintended Consequences: Potential unintended consequences include data breaches, misuse of genetic information, and exacerbation of healthcare disparities. To mitigate these risks, the system must continuously update its security protocols, enforce strict data handling policies, and ensure equitable access to genomic testing and personalized treatments across different populations.\n\nc) Potential Improvement: One potential improvement to the system is the integration of real-time data from wearable devices and other health monitoring technologies. This could provide continuous health insights, enabling even more personalized and timely interventions.\n\nd) Research Agenda: A comprehensive research agenda should focus on addressing current limitations in AI-driven personalized medicine, such as improving algorithm transparency, reducing biases, and enhancing the interpretability of AI recommendations. Additionally, research should explore the long-term impact of personalized treatments on patient outcomes and quality of life.\n\nWord Count: 1024\n\nReferences:\n1. Vogenberg, F. R., & Barash, C. I.

Ensuring informed consent is paramount, as patients must understand the implications of genetic testing. Data privacy must be protected to prevent misuse and unauthorized access. There is also a risk of genetic discrimination in employment and insurance.\n\n   b) Ethical Dilemma: Duty to Warn Relatives\n   The duty to warn relatives about genetic risks presents a significant ethical dilemma. On one hand, informing relatives could prevent harm by enabling early interventions. On the other hand, it infringes on patient confidentiality and autonomy. Our system addresses this by integrating a consent-based framework where patients are encouraged to inform relatives. If a patient refuses, the system includes a protocol for healthcare providers to ethically balance confidentiality with the duty to warn, potentially involving genetic counselors to mediate the discussion.\n\n   c) Criticism and Counterargument\n   One potential criticism is that the system might pressure patients into disclosing information, compromising their autonomy. To counter this, the system ensures that patients receive comprehensive genetic counseling to understand the importance of sharing information while respecting their right to make an informed decision.\n\n4.

Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific and ethical plausibility.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section, numbered as above. Use subheadings (a, b, c, d) within each section to organize your thoughts. Your total response should be between 850-1050 words.\n\nCite at least three relevant scientific studies or papers to support your claims and proposals. Use a consistent citation format (e.g., [Author, Year]) throughout your response.\n\nInclude a word count at the end of your response.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The AI-Genomic System Design is coherent and addresses the key components\",\n            \"The Personalized Medicine Approach demonstrates understanding of the specific medical condition and genetic factors\",\n            \"The Ethical Implications and Dilemma Analysis provides a thoughtful analysis of the specific ethical dilemma\",\n            \"The Societal Impact and Future Developments section offers relevant insights and suggestions\",\n            \"The response includes at least three relevant scientific citations\",\n            \"The response follows the specified format with clear headings and subheadings\",\n            \"The total word count is between 850-1050 words\",\n            \"The response addresses at least one potential criticism or counterargument to the proposed solution\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the nature of the task at hand, it involves a high level of interdisciplinary knowledge integration, ethical reasoning, and creative problem-solving in domains such as genomics, AI, and medical science. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Complexity and Scope**:\n    - The task demands a comprehensive understanding of genomics, AI system design, and medical science, which are highly specialized fields.\n    - It also requires the ability to articulate ethical considerations and societal impacts, which involves philosophical reasoning and knowledge of current ethical debates.\n\n2. **Detailed Requirements**:\n    - The task includes multiple sections, each with specific and detailed requirements.\n    - The response must be well-structured, with clear headings and subheadings, and must stay within a defined word count range.\n    - The response must cite at least three relevant scientific studies, which implies an ability to reference and integrate academic literature appropriately.\n\n3. **Evaluation Criteria**:\n    - The criteria for scoring are quite rigorous, covering coherence, understanding of medical conditions, ethical analysis, societal impact, and adherence to the specified format.\n    - The success of the LLM is judged by another LLM (via `eval_with_llm_judge`), which may add a layer of unpredictability to the evaluation process.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty Level**:\n    - The estimated human difficulty is marked as \"very difficult,\" suggesting that even for human experts, completing this task proficiently is challenging.\n\nGiven the above points, it is not surprising that the LLM agent failed at this task. The interdisciplinary nature and depth of knowledge required, combined with the need for structured and well-referenced responses, make it a highly challenging task for an AI. Most current LLMs, while capable of impressive feats in language understanding and generation, might struggle to integrate and articulate such specialized knowledge with the expected level of detail and coherence.\n\nDecision: No"
