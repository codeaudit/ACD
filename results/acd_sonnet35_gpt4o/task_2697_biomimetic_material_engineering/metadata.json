            "### 1. Biomimetic Material Design\n\n**a) Key Features and Properties:**\nThe novel material, named \"AquaGuard,\" features a superhydrophobic surface with micro-nano hierarchical structures that mimic the lotus leaf. It incorporates a self-healing polymer matrix and embedded nanoparticles to enhance durability and functionality. Key properties include water repellency, flexibility, and resistance to environmental stressors such as UV radiation and abrasion.\n\n**b) Biological Inspiration:**\nAquaGuard is inspired by the lotus leaf's water-repellent surface, achieved through micro-nano structures that create a rough texture and reduce surface energy. This results in high contact angles, causing water droplets to roll off easily. The material's design emulates these structures to achieve similar hydrophobicity.\n\n**c) Ecological Principle:**\nThe material reflects the ecological principle of adaptation to environmental stress by incorporating self-healing capabilities. This self-healing mechanism, inspired by natural processes, allows the material to repair minor damages autonomously, extending its lifespan and maintaining functionality in harsh agricultural environments.\n\n**d) Structural Diagram Description:**\nThe material consists of a polymer matrix embedded with silica nanoparticles. The surface features microscopic protrusions (10-20 micrometers) and nanoscopic ridges (100-200 nanometers) to mimic the lotus leaf's hierarchical structure.\n\n**e) Quantitative Properties:**\n1. Contact Angle: >150 degrees\n2. Tensile Strength: 50 MPa\n3. Density: 1.2 g/cm\u00b3\n\n### 2.
