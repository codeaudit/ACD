            "### 1. Hybrid Neural Network Architecture\n\n**a) Overall Structure:**\nThe hybrid neural network comprises two main components: cerebellar circuits and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The cerebellar circuits are responsible for fine-tuning and coordinating motor actions and cognitive processes, while the ANNs handle complex data processing and pattern recognition. The architecture integrates these components in a hierarchical manner where the cerebellar circuits provide real-time feedback to the ANN layers.\n\n**b) Integration of Cerebellar Circuits and ANN:**\nThe cerebellar circuits are interfaced with the ANNs via a bi-directional communication channel.
