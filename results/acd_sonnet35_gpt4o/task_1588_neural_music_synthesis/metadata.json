Successfully integrating these diverse fields to create a coherent and plausible model is highly challenging.\n\n2. **Scientific Plausibility**: The agent must not only generate a model but ensure it is scientifically plausible, which requires a nuanced understanding of complex concepts and the ability to innovate within these constraints.\n\n3. **Detailed and Technical Response**: The response format demands detailed technical descriptions and clear explanations across multiple sections, each focusing on different aspects of the model design and implementation.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The evaluation criteria are stringent, requiring the response to demonstrate a deep understanding and thoughtful consideration of various factors.
