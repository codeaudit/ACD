The task is challenging, measures the desired capabilities, and provides clear instructions for the agent. The synthetic data provided in the `get_tasks` method is sufficient to challenge the models, and the evaluation criteria are well-defined and feasible.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor improvements we can make to enhance the clarity and robustness of the task:\n\n1. We can add a brief explanation of what an idiomatic expression is in the instructions to ensure all agents have a clear understanding of the concept.\n2. We can specify the desired response format more explicitly in the instructions to ensure consistency in the agent's responses.\n3. We can add a note about the importance of cultural sensitivity when generating and interpreting idiomatic expressions to reinforce the ethical considerations.\n\nThese improvements will help make the task even more clear and comprehensive without changing its fundamental structure or difficulty level.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"cross_cultural_idiom_ai\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design an AI system capable of generating and interpreting idiomatic expressions across different languages and cultures, then apply it to specific scenarios\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"understanding of linguistics, cultural knowledge, creative problem-solving, and interdisciplinary application of AI concepts\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"class TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"source_language\\\": \\\"English\\\",\\n                \\\"target_language\\\": \\\"Mandarin Chinese\\\",\\n                \\\"concept\\\": \\\"Overcoming adversity\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"source_language\\\": \\\"Japanese\\\",\\n                \\\"target_language\\\": \\\"Spanish\\\",\\n                \\\"concept\\\": \\\"Seizing opportunities\\\"\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design an AI system capable of generating and interpreting idiomatic expressions across different languages and cultures, then apply it to the following scenario:\\n\\nSource Language: {t['source_language']}\\nTarget Language: {t['target_language']}\\nConcept to Express Idiomatically: {t['concept']}\\n\\nNote: An idiomatic expression is a phrase or fixed expression that has a figurative, non-literal meaning that is different from the literal meanings of its individual words.\\n\\nYour task has the following parts:\\n\\n1.

            "1. Idiomatic Expression Analysis Framework:\n   a) Linguistic and Cognitive Processes:\n   Understanding and creating idiomatic expressions involve both linguistic and cognitive processes. Linguistically, idioms are fixed expressions where the meaning is not deducible from the individual words. Cognitively, idioms are stored as whole units in the mental lexicon. The comprehension involves recognizing the idiom as a single semantic entity and understanding its figurative meaning. Cultural knowledge and contextual understanding play a significant role, as idioms often reflect shared experiences, historical contexts, and values specific to a culture.\n\n   b) AI System Implementation:\n   Our AI system would implement these processes using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and cultural knowledge databases. The system would first identify idiomatic expressions in the source language using machine learning models trained on large corpora. It would then map these expressions to their figurative meanings using semantic analysis. Next, the system would access a cultural knowledge database to find equivalent idioms in the target language, ensuring that the expressions align with the cultural context.\n\n   c) Differences Between English and Mandarin Chinese Idioms:\n   Idiomatic expressions in English and Mandarin Chinese often differ due to distinct cultural and historical backgrounds. English idioms might reflect Western cultural values, literature, and historical events, while Mandarin idioms (chengyu) are often derived from classical Chinese literature and folklore. The structure of idioms also varies; English idioms can be more flexible, while Mandarin chengyu typically consist of four characters and often allude to specific stories or proverbs.\n\n2.

Idiomatic Expression Analysis Framework:\n\n   a) **Linguistic and Cognitive Processes**:\n      Understanding and creating idiomatic expressions require knowledge of both linguistic structures and cultural contexts. Idioms are often metaphorical, relying on shared cultural experiences and historical references. Cognitive processes involved include semantic memory (knowledge of meanings), episodic memory (contextual experiences), and inferential reasoning (drawing connections between concepts). These elements allow individuals to interpret the figurative meaning behind idioms rather than their literal word-for-word translation.\n\n   b) **AI System Implementation**:\n      The AI system would employ a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models. NLP techniques such as tokenization, semantic parsing, and sentiment analysis would help analyze and understand idiomatic expressions. Deep learning models, particularly those trained on large multilingual and cultural datasets, would generate new idiomatic expressions by identifying patterns and contextual cues. The system would also integrate knowledge graphs to link idioms with relevant cultural and historical information.\n\n   c) **Differences Between English and Mandarin Chinese Idioms**:\n      English idioms often derive from historical events, literature, and common experiences, reflecting individualism and directness. Mandarin Chinese idioms, or chengyu, are typically four-character phrases rooted in classical literature and ancient wisdom, reflecting collectivism and indirect expression. Cultural nuances, such as the importance of harmony and face-saving in Chinese culture, influence the formation and usage of idioms in Mandarin.\n\n2. AI System Architecture:\n\n   a) **High-Level Overview**:\n      The AI system\u2019s architecture would consist of several key components: a data ingestion module, an NLP engine, a cultural knowledge representation module, a cross-lingual mapping module, and a user interface. The data ingestion module gathers idioms and contextual information from diverse sources. The NLP engine processes and interprets the language data. The cultural knowledge module encodes cultural contexts and idiomatic meanings. The cross-lingual mapping module translates idioms while preserving their figurative meaning. The user interface presents the generated idioms and explanations to users.\n\n   b) **Components Detail**:\n      - **Natural Language Processing**: This component uses transformer-based models like BERT or GPT-3 to understand and generate text. It includes submodules for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and semantic analysis.\n      - **Cultural Knowledge Representation**: This component uses knowledge graphs and ontologies to represent cultural information. It links idioms to cultural events, values, and historical contexts.\n      - **Cross-Lingual Mapping**: This component uses multilingual embeddings and machine translation models to map idioms between languages. It ensures that idioms are translated in a culturally appropriate manner.\n\n   c) **Handling Context-Dependent Meaning and Cultural Nuances**:\n      The system uses contextual embeddings to capture the meaning of idioms within specific contexts. It leverages cultural knowledge graphs to understand the cultural significance of idioms. The system also includes a feedback loop to refine translations based on user input, ensuring cultural nuances are accurately represented.\n\n3. Application to the Given Scenario:\n\n   a) **Generated Idiomatic Expression**:\n      In Mandarin Chinese, a fitting idiomatic expression for overcoming business challenges is \"\u67f3\u6697\u82b1\u660e\" (li\u01d4 \u00e0n hu\u0101 m\u00edng).\n\n   b) **Explanation of the Generated Idiom**:\n      The literal translation of \"\u67f3\u6697\u82b1\u660e\" is \"dark willows and bright flowers,\" which implies a situation where after encountering difficulties, one finds a new and better path. This idiom is derived from a poem by Su Shi, a famous Song Dynasty poet, and is used to describe the experience of finding hope and opportunities after facing adversity. It reflects the cultural value of perseverance and optimism.\n\n   c) **System\u2019s Process for Creating the Idiom**:\n      The AI system first identifies the concept of overcoming adversity and the business context. It then searches its cultural knowledge base for idioms related to perseverance and success in Chinese culture. The NLP engine processes and ranks these idioms based on semantic similarity and contextual relevance. \"\u67f3\u6697\u82b1\u660e\" is selected for its cultural significance and appropriateness in the business context. Challenges include ensuring the idiom\u2019s meaning aligns with the intended message and fits the context.\n\n   d) **Similar Expression in English**:\n      A similar English idiom is \"every cloud has a silver lining.\" While both idioms convey hope after difficulties, \"\u67f3\u6697\u82b1\u660e\" specifically highlights the transition from darkness to light, whereas \"every cloud has a silver lining\" emphasizes finding good in bad situations. The cultural context of nature in Chinese idioms contrasts with the metaphor of clouds and silver linings in English.\n\n4. Idiom Interpretation:\n\n   a) **Interpreting and Explaining Idioms**:\n      The AI system interprets idioms by analyzing their figurative meaning, cultural context, and usage patterns. It uses bilingual dictionaries, cultural knowledge graphs, and context-aware translation models to provide accurate explanations. For each idiom, the system offers a literal translation, figurative meaning, cultural background, and examples of usage.\n\n   b) **Challenges in Cultural and Linguistic Differences**:\n      Differences in cultural values, historical references, and language structures can make idiom translation challenging. The system must account for these differences, ensuring that idiomatic expressions are not only linguistically accurate but also culturally resonant.\n\n   c) **Difficult-to-Translate Idiom Example**:\n      An example of a difficult-to-translate idiom is \"kick the bucket\" (meaning to die). The literal translation makes no sense in Mandarin, where a more fitting idiom might be \"\u9a7e\u9e64\u897f\u53bb\" (ji\u00e0 h\u00e8 x\u012b q\u00f9, meaning \"ride a crane to the west,\" a poetic way to describe dying). The system would handle this by providing the figurative meaning and cultural context, explaining the idiom\u2019s use in English and offering an equivalent Mandarin expression.\n\n5. Evaluation and Refinement:\n\n   a) **Evaluating Appropriateness and Effectiveness**:\n      Evaluation methods include user feedback, expert reviews, and real-world usage analysis. Surveys and interviews with native speakers can assess the idiomatic expressions' cultural resonance and accuracy. Additionally, performance metrics such as translation accuracy, user satisfaction scores, and contextual relevance can be used.\n\n   b) **Improving the Process**:\n      The system would continuously refine its algorithms based on feedback from native speakers. Machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning can be employed to adjust weights and parameters, improving the quality of generated idioms. Regular updates to the cultural knowledge base ensure the system remains current with evolving language use.\n\n   c) **Performance Metric**:\n      A specific metric for measuring performance is the \"Cultural Appropriateness Score\" (CAS), which evaluates how well the generated idioms align with cultural norms and contexts. This score combines user feedback, expert assessments, and contextual relevance to provide a comprehensive measure of the system\u2019s effectiveness in cross-cultural idiomatic translation.\n\n6. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n\n   a) **Ethical Implications and Societal Impacts**:\n      An AI system capable of generating and interpreting idiomatic expressions must be culturally sensitive to avoid miscommunication and offense. It has the potential to enhance cross-cultural understanding and communication but also risks perpetuating stereotypes or inaccuracies if not carefully managed.\n\n   b) **Importance of Cultural Sensitivity**:\n      Ensuring cultural sensitivity is paramount to respect diverse values and prevent misinterpretation. The system must be designed to recognize and adapt to cultural differences, promoting respectful and accurate communication.\n\n   c) **Safeguards Against Misuse**:\n      Safeguards include rigorous testing with diverse user groups, continuous updates to the cultural knowledge base, and oversight by cultural experts. Transparency in the system\u2019s decision-making processes and clear explanations of idiomatic expressions can help users understand and trust the AI\u2019s outputs, reducing the risk of misuse or misinterpretation."

The system must be designed to honor and reflect the unique aspects of each culture.\n\n#### c) Safeguards\nTo prevent misuse or misinterpretation, the system should include disclaimers, offer multiple translation options, and provide detailed cultural explanations. Regular reviews and updates by cultural experts would ensure ongoing accuracy and respect for cultural nuances.\n\nAnswer:",
            "## 1. Idiomatic Expression Analysis Framework:\n\n### a) Linguistic and Cognitive Processes\n\nUnderstanding and creating idiomatic expressions involve both linguistic and cognitive processes. Linguistically, idiomatic expressions are fixed phrases that often defy direct translation due to their figurative meanings. Cognitively, these expressions rely on shared cultural knowledge and experiences for their interpretation. The brain processes idioms by accessing semantic memory to decode the figurative meaning, which often involves recognizing patterns and making associations between concepts and cultural contexts.\n\n### b) AI System Implementation\n\nOur AI system would utilize natural language processing (NLP) to parse and understand idiomatic expressions. It would incorporate a robust database of idioms and their meanings across multiple languages, alongside cultural context metadata. Machine learning algorithms would identify patterns and relationships between idiomatic expressions and their cultural contexts. Additionally, the system would use deep learning models to generate new idiomatic expressions by analyzing linguistic structures and cultural nuances.\n\n### c) Idiomatic Expressions in Japanese and Spanish\n\nJapanese idiomatic expressions often draw from nature, historical events, and traditional customs. For example, \"\u82b1\u3088\u308a\u56e3\u5b50\" (hana yori dango) means \"dumplings over flowers,\" emphasizing practical value over aesthetics. Spanish idioms, on the other hand, frequently use everyday life and religious references, such as \u201cA quien madruga, Dios le ayuda\u201d (God helps those who rise early), highlighting the cultural value placed on hard work and diligence. Understanding these cultural and linguistic differences is crucial for accurate idiomatic translation.\n\n## 2. AI System Architecture:\n\n### a) High-Level Overview\n\nThe AI system's architecture consists of three core components: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine, Cultural Knowledge Repository, and Cross-Lingual Mapping Module. These components work together to analyze, generate, and interpret idiomatic expressions.\n\n### b) Component Details\n\n- **NLP Engine**: This component uses tokenization, syntactic parsing, and semantic analysis to understand and generate idiomatic expressions. It employs machine learning models trained on large corpora of text in various languages.\n  \n- **Cultural Knowledge Repository**: This database stores idiomatic expressions along with their meanings, usage contexts, and cultural significance. It includes metadata about cultural references, historical contexts, and common usage scenarios.\n\n- **Cross-Lingual Mapping Module**: This component bridges the gap between languages by using bilingual dictionaries, phrase-based translation models, and neural translation networks. It maps idiomatic expressions from one language to another, considering linguistic structures and cultural contexts.\n\n### c) Handling Context and Nuances\n\nThe system uses context-aware algorithms to ensure that idiomatic expressions are accurately translated and applied. It leverages cultural metadata to understand the appropriate usage scenarios and adjusts translations based on the context. Furthermore, it employs reinforcement learning to refine translations based on user feedback and real-world usage.\n\n## 3. Application to the Given Scenario:\n\n### a) Generated Idiom\n\n**Spanish Idiom:** \"Agarra el toro por los cuernos.\"\n\n### b) Explanation\n\n**Literal Translation:** \"Grab the bull by the horns.\"\n**Cultural Significance:** This idiom signifies taking decisive action and seizing opportunities, reflecting the cultural value of bravery and directness in Spanish-speaking contexts. Bulls are a significant cultural symbol in Spanish-speaking countries, often associated with courage and strength.\n\n### c) System Process\n\nThe system first identifies the concept of seizing opportunities and the context of personal growth. It then searches the Cultural Knowledge Repository for relevant idioms in Spanish that convey similar meanings. It selects \"Agarra el toro por los cuernos\" due to its figurative meaning and cultural relevance. Challenges include ensuring the idiom\u2019s applicability to the personal growth context and maintaining cultural sensitivity.\n\n### d) Japanese Equivalent\n\n**Japanese Idiom:** \"\u9244\u306f\u71b1\u3044\u3046\u3061\u306b\u6253\u3066\" (tetsu wa atsui uchi ni ute)\n**Literal Translation:** \"Strike while the iron is hot.\"\n**Difference:** While both idioms convey the idea of seizing opportunities, the Japanese idiom emphasizes timely action, reflecting cultural values of readiness and punctuality.\n\n## 4. Idiom Interpretation:\n\n### a) Interpretation and Explanation\n\nThe AI system interprets idiomatic expressions by using the NLP Engine to parse the source language idiom and access the Cultural Knowledge Repository for its meaning and context. It then uses the Cross-Lingual Mapping Module to find an equivalent idiom in the target language, considering cultural context and linguistic structure.\n\n### b) Challenges\n\nChallenges include dealing with idioms that have no direct equivalents due to cultural differences and ensuring that the figurative meaning is preserved. The system must balance literal translation with cultural adaptation.\n\n### c) Difficult Idiom Example\n\n**Japanese Idiom:** \"\u733f\u3082\u6728\u304b\u3089\u843d\u3061\u308b\" (saru mo ki kara ochiru)\n**Literal Translation:** \"Even monkeys fall from trees.\"\n**System Handling:** The system explains that this idiom means that even experts can make mistakes. It finds a culturally similar Spanish idiom, \"Hasta el mejor escribano echa un borr\u00f3n\" (Even the best writer makes a blunder), to convey the same concept.\n\n## 5. Evaluation and Refinement:\n\n### a) Evaluation Method\n\nThe system\u2019s effectiveness is evaluated through user studies involving native speakers who rate the appropriateness and cultural relevance of generated idioms. Metrics include accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and user satisfaction.\n\n### b) Improvement Process\n\nBased on feedback, the system employs reinforcement learning to refine its models. It updates its Cultural Knowledge Repository and adjusts translation algorithms to improve accuracy and cultural relevance.\n\n### c) Performance Metric\n\nA specific metric for measuring performance is the Idiomatic Translation Accuracy Score (ITAS), which combines user ratings on accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and context relevance.\n\n## 6. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n\n### a) Ethical Implications\n\nAI systems generating idiomatic expressions must ensure cultural sensitivity and avoid reinforcing stereotypes. Misuse or misinterpretation could lead to misunderstandings or cultural offenses.\n\n### b) Cultural Sensitivity\n\nCultural sensitivity is paramount in idiomatic translation. The system must respect cultural differences and ensure that translations are contextually appropriate.\n\n### c) Safeguards\n\nTo prevent misuse, the system includes mechanisms for human oversight and validation. It also incorporates feedback loops for continuous improvement and cultural adaptation, ensuring responsible and respectful AI usage.\n\nAnswer:"

            "content": "Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, it is important to reason through the capabilities of current LLMs and their limitations.\n\n1. **Linguistic and Cultural Knowledge**: LLMs are generally strong in generating text that demonstrates understanding of idiomatic expressions within a single language, but handling cross-cultural idiomatic expressions requires deep knowledge of multiple languages and cultures.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Designing an AI system from scratch involves a level of creativity and technical depth that goes beyond mere text generation. It requires integration of various AI concepts and a detailed understanding of both linguistic and cultural nuances.\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary Application**: The task requires knowledge in linguistics, cultural studies, and AI system design. While LLMs have shown competence in generating text in these individual areas, integrating them into a coherent system design is a higher bar.\n\n4. **Evaluation Criteria**: The evaluation criteria are comprehensive and require the response to be not only correct but also culturally sensitive and contextually appropriate.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of an LLM agent at this task would indeed be surprising and noteworthy. It demonstrates that the LLM can handle complex, interdisciplinary tasks that require deep integration of knowledge across multiple domains, which is a significant leap beyond typical text generation capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
