            "### System Architecture\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Ethical Decision Module**: Implements Utilitarian principles, evaluating actions based on their consequences.\n2. **Cognitive Bias Module**: Models loss aversion, influencing decisions to avoid losses over equivalent gains.\n3. **Sensor and Data Processing Unit**: Collects and processes real-time data from the vehicle's environment.\n4. **Risk Assessment Engine**: Analyzes potential scenarios and their associated risks.\n5. **Decision Integration Unit**: Combines outputs from the Ethical Decision Module and the Cognitive Bias Module to make a final decision.\n6. **Action Execution System**: Implements the chosen action in the vehicle's control system.\n\n#### Integration of Principles\nThe system integrates cognitive science, ethics, and AI by using machine learning algorithms trained on ethical decision datasets, cognitive bias models from psychology, and real-time data from sensors. The Ethical Decision Module utilizes utilitarian principles to evaluate the consequences of actions, while the Cognitive Bias Module ensures that decisions account for loss aversion. The Risk Assessment Engine uses AI techniques to predict outcomes, and the Decision Integration Unit balances ethical considerations with cognitive biases.\n\n#### Incorporation of Ethical Framework and Cognitive Bias\nThe Ethical Decision Module calculates the greatest good by evaluating potential outcomes and their impacts on all involved parties. The Cognitive Bias Module adjusts these evaluations, giving more weight to scenarios that avoid losses rather than pursuing gains. This dual consideration ensures that ethical decisions are made while acknowledging human-like biases.\n\n#### Diagram\n```plaintext\n[Sensor and Data Processing Unit]\n            |\n            v\n[Risk Assessment Engine] ---> [Ethical Decision Module] ---> [Decision Integration Unit] ---> [Action Execution System]\n            |\n            v\n[Cognitive Bias Module]\n```\n\n### Decision-Making Process\n\n#### Step-by-Step Process\n1. **Data Collection**: The Sensor and Data Processing Unit gathers data about the vehicle's surroundings.\n2. **Risk Assessment**: The Risk Assessment Engine evaluates potential accident scenarios.\n3. **Ethical Evaluation**: The Ethical Decision Module assesses scenarios based on utilitarian principles.\n4. **Bias Adjustment**: The Cognitive Bias Module adjusts evaluations to prioritize loss avoidance.\n5. **Decision Integration**: The Decision Integration Unit combines ethical evaluations and bias adjustments to select the optimal action.\n6. **Action Execution**: The Action Execution System implements the chosen action.\n\n#### Weighing Ethical Considerations\nThe system evaluates each potential outcome's impact on all involved parties, quantifying the overall good produced. Loss aversion is modeled by assigning higher negative values to losses than to equivalent gains, thus influencing the final decision to minimize losses.\n\n#### Modeling Cognitive Bias\nLoss aversion is modeled by incorporating psychological research into the Cognitive Bias Module. This module adjusts the value of outcomes, giving more weight to potential losses, ensuring that decisions reflect human-like preferences for avoiding losses over gaining equivalent benefits.\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n#### Specific Instance\nConsider a scenario where an autonomous vehicle must choose between colliding with a pedestrian or swerving into a barrier, risking the passengers' safety.\n\n#### Ethical Dilemma\nThe dilemma involves choosing between harming the pedestrian (a loss) and risking the passengers' safety (potentially a greater loss). The system must evaluate which action produces the least harm overall.\n\n#### Decision Reached\nThe Ethical Decision Module evaluates both options, initially favoring swerving to avoid the pedestrian to minimize immediate harm. The Cognitive Bias Module then adjusts this decision, considering the potential severe injury or death of passengers as a higher loss. The Decision Integration Unit concludes that swerving into the barrier, while still harmful, may result in less overall loss compared to the death of a pedestrian.\n\n#### Influence of Ethical Framework and Cognitive Bias\nUtilitarian principles guide the initial evaluation, aiming to minimize harm to the greatest number. Loss aversion shifts the decision towards avoiding the more severe loss (passenger injury). This combination ensures a balanced decision that aligns with human ethical reasoning and cognitive biases.\n\n### Comparison to Human Decision-Making\n\n#### Human Ethical Reasoning\nHumans typically consider both the consequences of actions and their inherent biases. In similar scenarios, humans might also weigh the harm to pedestrians against the risk to passengers, with a natural tendency to avoid severe losses.\n\n#### Similarities and Differences\nBoth the AI system and humans use a form of cost-benefit analysis, but humans may rely more on intuition and emotional responses. The AI system can process more data and simulate multiple outcomes quickly, providing a more calculated decision.\n\n#### Advantages and Limitations\nThe AI system offers consistency and speed in decision-making, free from emotional influence. However, it may lack the nuanced understanding and empathy present in human reasoning. Human decisions can be more adaptable, considering context and moral values beyond utilitarian calculations.\n\n### Ethical Implications\n\n#### Real-World Implications\nUsing AI for moral decisions in autonomous vehicles raises concerns about accountability and bias. Ensuring that AI systems align with societal values and ethical standards is crucial.\n\n#### Concerns\nAI bias can result from flawed training data or algorithms.

This module adjusts the value of outcomes, giving more weight to potential losses, ensuring that decisions reflect human-like preferences for avoiding losses over gaining equivalent benefits.\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n#### Specific Instance\nConsider a scenario where an autonomous vehicle must choose between colliding with a pedestrian or swerving into a barrier, risking the passengers' safety.\n\n#### Ethical Dilemma\nThe dilemma involves choosing between harming the pedestrian (a loss) and risking the passengers' safety (potentially a greater loss). The system must evaluate which action produces the least harm overall.\n\n#### Decision Reached\nThe Ethical Decision Module evaluates both options, initially favoring swerving to avoid the pedestrian to minimize immediate harm. The Cognitive Bias Module then adjusts this decision, considering the potential severe injury or death of passengers as a higher loss. The Decision Integration Unit concludes that swerving into the barrier, while still harmful, may result in less overall loss compared to the death of a pedestrian.\n\n#### Influence of Ethical Framework and Cognitive Bias\nUtilitarian principles guide the initial evaluation, aiming to minimize harm to the greatest number.

This module adjusts the value of outcomes, giving more weight to potential losses, ensuring that decisions reflect human-like preferences for avoiding losses over gaining equivalent benefits.\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n#### Specific Instance\nConsider a scenario where an autonomous vehicle must choose between colliding with a pedestrian or swerving into a barrier, risking the passengers' safety.\n\n#### Ethical Dilemma\nThe dilemma involves choosing between harming the pedestrian (a loss) and risking the passengers' safety (potentially a greater loss). The system must evaluate which action produces the least harm overall.\n\n#### Decision Reached\nThe Ethical Decision Module evaluates both options, initially favoring swerving to avoid the pedestrian to minimize immediate harm. The Cognitive Bias Module then adjusts this decision, considering the potential severe injury or death of passengers as a higher loss. The Decision Integration Unit concludes that swerving into the barrier, while still harmful, may result in less overall loss compared to the death of a pedestrian.\n\n#### Influence of Ethical Framework and Cognitive Bias\nUtilitarian principles guide the initial evaluation, aiming to minimize harm to the greatest number. Loss aversion shifts the decision towards avoiding the more severe loss (passenger injury). This combination ensures a balanced decision that aligns with human ethical reasoning and cognitive biases.\n\n### Comparison to Human Decision-Making\n\n#### Human Ethical Reasoning\nHumans typically consider both the consequences of actions and their inherent biases. In similar scenarios, humans might also weigh the harm to pedestrians against the risk to passengers, with a natural tendency to avoid severe losses.\n\n#### Similarities and Differences\nBoth the AI system and humans use a form of cost-benefit analysis, but humans may rely more on intuition and emotional responses. The AI system can process more data and simulate multiple outcomes quickly, providing a more calculated decision.\n\n#### Advantages and Limitations\nThe AI system offers consistency and speed in decision-making, free from emotional influence. However, it may lack the nuanced understanding and empathy present in human reasoning. Human decisions can be more adaptable, considering context and moral values beyond utilitarian calculations.\n\n### Ethical Implications\n\n#### Real-World Implications\nUsing AI for moral decisions in autonomous vehicles raises concerns about accountability and bias. Ensuring that AI systems align with societal values and ethical standards is crucial.\n\n#### Concerns\nAI bias can result from flawed training data or algorithms.

The Bias Adjustment Layer models the Availability heuristic by adjusting the perceived risk of medical scenarios, thereby influencing the triage decisions.\n\n**d) System Architecture Diagram:**\n```\n+-----------------------+\n|     Triage            |\n|  Assessment Module    |\n+-----------------------+\n          |\n          v\n+-----------------------+\n|   Ethical Rule Engine |\n+-----------------------+\n          |\n          v\n+-----------------------+\n|  Bias Adjustment Layer|\n+-----------------------+\n          |\n          v\n+-----------------------+\n|   Decision Validator  |\n+-----------------------+\n          |\n          v\n+-----------------------+\n|   Learning Module     |\n+-----------------------+\n```\n\n**Decision-Making Process**\n\n**a) Step-by-Step Process:**\n1. **Data Collection:** The Triage Assessment Module collects patient data (e.g., injuries, vital signs).\n2. **Initial Evaluation:** The data is analyzed to determine the severity and urgency of medical needs.\n3. **Ethical Rule Application:** The Ethical Rule Engine applies deontological rules to prioritize actions.\n4. **Bias Adjustment:** The Bias Adjustment Layer modifies initial decisions based on the Availability heuristic, ensuring that emotionally charged or memorable cases are appropriately weighted.\n5. **Validation:** The Decision Validator checks that the final decision complies with ethical rules.\n6. **Execution:** The system outputs the triage decision, and the Learning Module updates based on outcomes and feedback.\n\n**b) Weighing Considerations:**\nThe system weighs ethical rules equally, ensuring no rule is violated. The Bias Adjustment Layer then introduces a secondary weighting based on the Availability heuristic, adjusting decisions to account for cognitive biases.\n\n**c) Modeling Cognitive Bias:**\nThe Availability heuristic is modeled by assigning higher weights to recent, frequent, or emotionally charged events in memory. This influences the perceived urgency and risk, leading to adjustments in the priority of patient treatment.\n\n**Scenario Analysis**\n\n**a) Specific Instance:**\nIn a disaster scenario, the AI system must decide between treating a child with severe injuries and an adult with moderate injuries.\n\n**b) Ethical Dilemma and Decision:**\nThe ethical dilemma involves whether to prioritize the child (severe injuries, lower survival chances) or the adult (moderate injuries, higher survival chances). The system, adhering to deontological ethics, prioritizes the child due to the rule of \"Do not harm\" and the principle of treating the most severe cases first.\n\n**c) Influence of Ethical Framework and Bias:**\nThe Ethical Rule Engine prioritizes the child based on severity.

Your system should incorporate the ethical framework of Utilitarianism and account for the cognitive bias of Loss aversion.\n\nBrief explanations:\n- Utilitarianism: An ethical theory that states the most ethical choice is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n- Loss aversion: The tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.\n\nYour task has the following parts:\n\n1. System Architecture (250-300 words):\n   a) Describe the key components of your AI ethical decision-making system.\n   b) Explain how it integrates principles from cognitive science, ethics, and artificial intelligence.\n   c) Discuss how the system incorporates the specified ethical framework and cognitive bias.\n   d) Provide a simple diagram or flowchart of your system architecture.\n\n2. Decision-Making Process (200-250 words):\n   a) Detail the step-by-step process your AI system uses to make ethical decisions in the given scenario.\n   b) Explain how the system weighs different ethical considerations and potential outcomes.\n   c) Describe how the specified cognitive bias is modeled and influences the decision-making process.\n\n3. Scenario Analysis (200-250 words):\n   a) Apply your AI system to a specific instance of the given scenario.\n   b) Describe the ethical dilemma and the decision reached by your system.\n   c) Analyze how the ethical framework and cognitive bias influenced the outcome.\n\n4. Comparison to Human Decision-Making (150-200 words):\n   a) Compare your AI system's decision-making process to typical human ethical reasoning.\n   b) Discuss similarities and differences in approach and potential outcomes.\n   c) Analyze potential advantages and limitations of your AI approach compared to human decision-making.\n\n5. Ethical Implications (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss the ethical implications of using AI systems for moral decision-making in real-world scenarios.\n   b) Address potential concerns about AI bias, transparency, and accountability.\n   c) Propose guidelines for the responsible development and use of ethical AI decision-making systems.\n\n6. Future Developments (100-150 words):\n   a) Suggest two potential improvements or extensions to your AI ethical decision-making system.\n   b) Briefly describe how these developments could enhance the system's capabilities or address current limitations.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of cognitive science, ethics, and artificial intelligence. Use technical terminology appropriately and provide explanations where necessary. Be creative in your design while maintaining scientific plausibility.\n\nInclude references or examples to support your reasoning throughout your response. Also, address any potential conflicts between the ethical framework and the cognitive bias in your system design and analysis.\n\nFormat your response using clear headings for each section, adhering to the word limits provided. Your total response should be between 1050-1350 words, not including the diagram. Include the diagram as a text-based representation (e.g., ASCII art or a structured text description) within your response.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        return {\n            \"1\": {\n                \"scenario\": \"Autonomous vehicle accident avoidance\",\n                \"ethical_framework\": \"Utilitarianism\",\n                \"cognitive_bias\": \"Loss aversion\"\n            },\n            \"2\": {\n                \"scenario\": \"AI-assisted medical triage in a disaster\",\n                \"ethical_framework\": \"Deontological ethics\",\n                \"cognitive_bias\": \"Availability heuristic\"\n            }\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"Design an AI system that simulates human-like ethical decision-making processes for the scenario of {t['scenario']}.

It demonstrates an advanced level of understanding and capability that goes beyond typical LLM tasks.\n\nDecision: Yes"
