            "1. Language Design\n\na) Basic Vocabulary and Grammar\nThe artificial language is called \"Tempuslex.\" Tempuslex features an extensive tense system with distinct markers for immediate future (IF), near future (NF), distant future (DF), immediate past (IP), near past (NP), and distant past (DP). Vocabulary and grammar are designed to emphasize temporal precision. For example:\n\n- \"Solvo\" (solve)\n- \"Logica\" (logic)\n- \"Puzzle\" (puzzle)\n- Tense markers: -im (IF), -nf (NF), -df (DF), -ip (IP), -np (NP), -dp (DP)\n- Example sentence structure: Subject-Verb-Object-Tense\n\nb) Influence on Cognitive Processes\nThe highly detailed tense system forces speakers to be precise about when actions and events occur, potentially enhancing their ability to plan and anticipate multiple future scenarios. This may lead to more nuanced and flexible problem-solving strategies, as speakers are accustomed to thinking in detailed temporal frameworks.\n\nc) Example Sentences\n1. \"Ego solvo puzzle-im.\" (I will solve the puzzle immediately.)\n2. \"Tu solvo puzzle-nf.\" (You will solve the puzzle in the near future.)\n3. \"Ille solvo puzzle-np.\" (He solved the puzzle recently.)\n4. \"Nos solvo puzzle-df.\" (We will solve the puzzle in the distant future.)\n5. \"Ego solvo puzzle-dp.\" (I solved the puzzle long ago.)\n\n2. AI System Architecture\n\na) Components\nThe AI system comprises several modules:\n- Language Processing Unit (LPU): Generates sentences in Tempuslex.\n- Cognitive Strategy Modeler (CSM): Simulates cognitive strategies influenced by temporal precision.\n- Problem Solver Engine (PSE): Applies generated strategies to solve logical puzzles.\n- Temporal Context Analyzer (TCA): Ensures temporal context is considered in problem-solving.\n\nb) Influence Modeling\nThe system models the influence of language structure on cognitive strategies by embedding temporal markers into the problem-solving process. The CSM uses these markers to prioritize tasks based on temporal proximity, enhancing flexibility and anticipation.\n\nc) Novel Techniques\n- Temporal Embedding Algorithm (TEA): Integrates tense markers into cognitive strategy models.\n- Adaptive Problem-Solving Neural Network (APNN): Adjusts strategies dynamically based on temporal context.\n- Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL): Continuously refines strategies by comparing predicted and actual outcomes over multiple temporal contexts.\n\n3. Problem-Solving Simulation\n\na) Problem Scenario\nThe logical puzzle: \"There are three boxes. One contains a prize, and two are empty. You can open one box. If you don't find the prize, you get a hint about which box to open next.\"\n\nb) AI Approach\nThe AI first considers immediate actions: \"Ego aperio prima box-im.\" (I will open the first box immediately.) If no prize is found, it uses near future planning: \"Ego accipio hint-nf.\" (I will receive a hint in the near future.) It then re-evaluates its strategy based on the hint: \"Ego aperio secunda box-nf.\" (I will open the second box in the near future.)\n\nc) AI 'Thought Process'\n1. \"Ego aperio prima box-im.\" (I will open the first box immediately.)\n2. \"Ego accipio hint-nf.\" (I will receive a hint in the near future.)\n3. \"Ego aperio secunda box-nf.\" (I will open the second box in the near future.)\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\na) Hypothetical Approach Without Temporal Detail\nIn a language without detailed tenses, the approach might be more linear and less adaptive. The AI might generate a simple strategy: \"Open one box. If no prize, get a hint. Open another box.\"\n\nb) Analysis of Differences\nThe Tempuslex-based AI's strategy is more nuanced, with clear temporal markers guiding each step. This leads to more adaptive planning and potentially quicker solutions, as the AI continuously re-evaluates its approach based on immediate and near future contexts.\n\nc) Relation to Linguistic Relativity\nThese differences highlight how language structure can shape cognitive processes. The detailed tense system in Tempuslex encourages a more dynamic and anticipatory problem-solving strategy, supporting the theory that language influences thought patterns and cognitive flexibility.\n\n5. Implications and Limitations\n\na) Implications for Human Cognition\nThe findings suggest that language with detailed temporal structures may enhance planning and adaptive problem-solving skills. This supports the idea that linguistic features can shape cognitive processes and decision-making strategies.\n\nb) Limitations and Biases\nThe simulation's reliance on predefined algorithms may not fully capture human cognitive flexibility. Additionally, the artificial nature of the language and problem domain might introduce biases that do not generalize to natural languages or real-world scenarios.\n\nc) Future Experiments\nFuture experiments could involve more complex problem domains and natural languages with varied temporal structures. Expanding the AI's capabilities to simulate cultural and contextual influences on language and cognition could provide deeper insights into linguistic relativity.",
            "1. Language Design\n\na) Basic Vocabulary and Grammar:\nOur artificial language, Futuro-Pastique, possesses a highly detailed tense system with multiple future and past tenses. The vocabulary emphasizes temporal nuances. For instance, verbs can be conjugated into past-past (events that occurred long ago), recent-past (events that occurred recently), immediate-future (events about to happen), and distant-future (events far ahead). \n\nSample vocabulary:\n- \"Solvo\" (solve)\n- \"Enigma\" (puzzle)\n- \"Consilus\" (strategy)\n- \"Tempus\" (time)\n- \"Verum\" (truth)\n- \"Memoria\" (memory)\n- \"Future\" (future)\n- \"Praeteritus\" (past)\n\nGrammar highlights:\n- Verb conjugation: \"Solvopastpast\" (solved long ago), \"Solvorecentpast\" (solved recently), \"Solvoimmediatefuture\" (about to solve), \"Solvodistantfuture\" (will solve far ahead).\n- Sentence structure: Subject-Verb-Object, with tense markers.\n  \nb) Influence on Cognitive Processes:\nThe intricate tense system may lead users to consider the temporal context more deeply, affecting their problem-solving strategies. They might track past attempts meticulously and forecast future steps with greater precision, fostering a detailed temporal awareness.\n\nc) Example Sentences:\n1. \"Ego Solvopastpast Enigma.\" (I solved the puzzle long ago.)\n2. \"Nos Solvoimmediatefuture Enigma.\" (We are about to solve the puzzle.)\n3. \"Ego Verum Memoria Solvorecentpast.\" (I recently remembered the truth.)\n\n2. AI System Architecture\n\na) Components:\nThe AI system, named TempusSolver, comprises several components:\n- Temporal Language Generator: Translates problem scenarios and solutions into Futuro-Pastique.\n- Temporal Cognitive Model: Simulates problem-solving strategies influenced by the language's tense system.\n- Solution Tracker: Logs past solutions and forecasts future attempts considering temporal nuances.\n- Decision Engine: Uses algorithms to choose optimal strategies based on temporal data.\n\nb) Modeling Language Influence:\nThe Temporal Cognitive Model employs neural networks trained on datasets that simulate how tense influences decision-making. It models the relationship between temporal awareness and cognitive strategies, forecasting how different tenses impact problem-solving.\n\nc) Novel Techniques/Algorithms:\n- Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks (TRNNs): Handle sequences of events with multiple temporal dimensions.\n- Temporal Attention Mechanism: Focuses on relevant temporal data, enhancing decision precision.\n- Temporal Planning Algorithm (TPA): Projects future steps based on past data, optimizing problem-solving strategies.\n\n3. Problem-Solving Simulation\n\na) Problem Scenario:\nA logical puzzle involves arranging colored blocks in a specific sequence to unlock a door. The sequence must be deduced from clues given in stages.\n\nb) AI's Approach:\nTempusSolver first logs each clue and attempts to solve the puzzle by predicting future steps based on past clues and immediate actions. It uses the Temporal Planning Algorithm to forecast potential sequences and test them systematically.\n\nc) Examples of AI's 'Thought Process':\n1. \"Ego Clue Memoria Solvorecentpast.\" (I recently remembered the clue.)\n2. \"Nos Solvoimmediatefuture Sequentia.\" (We are about to solve the sequence.)\n3. \"Praeteritus Clue Solvodistantfuture.\" (Based on past clues, we will solve the sequence far ahead.)\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\na) Hypothetical Approach in a Language Without Detailed Tenses:\nIn English, the AI might approach the puzzle by logging clues and testing sequences without nuanced temporal tracking, e.g., \"I remember a clue,\" \"We will solve the sequence.\"\n\nb) Potential Differences:\nIn Futuro-Pastique, the AI's strategy is more temporally nuanced, considering the timing of each clue and past attempts more rigorously. In English, the approach may be more linear and less temporally detailed.\n\nc) Relation to Linguistic Relativity:\nThis difference illustrates linguistic relativity, where language structure shapes cognitive processes. The detailed tense system in Futuro-Pastique fosters a more temporal and context-aware problem-solving approach, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate solutions.\n\n5. Implications and Limitations\n\na) Implications:\nThese findings suggest language structure significantly impacts cognitive processes, supporting the theory of linguistic relativity. Understanding how temporal nuances influence problem-solving can inform cognitive science and AI development, potentially leading to more sophisticated and human-like AI systems.\n\nb) Limitations:\nThe simulation may not fully capture human cognitive complexity, and biases in training data could affect results. Additionally, the artificial language's simplicity might not encompass all real-world linguistic intricacies.\n\nc) Future Experiments:\nFurther experiments could involve more complex problem domains and varied linguistic features. Expanding the AI to simulate different languages and comparing outcomes could deepen our understanding of linguistic relativity. Incorporating human-AI collaboration in problem-solving tasks could also yield insightful data on cognitive influence.",

            "1. Language Design\n\na) Basic Vocabulary and Grammar:\nThe artificial language, \"ColorLang,\" is constructed with a rich color vocabulary that includes fine-grained distinctions. The vocabulary includes terms like \"bluered\" (a color between blue and red), \"lightgreen,\" \"darkblue,\" \"sunsetorange,\" and \"skyblue.\" The grammar follows Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) structure, with modifiers preceding nouns. For example, \"bright-skyblue flower see.\"\n\nb) Influence on Cognitive Processes:\nThe fine-grained color distinctions in ColorLang could enhance visual discrimination abilities and influence cognitive processes by making speakers more attuned to subtle differences. In problem-solving, this heightened perceptual sensitivity may lead to more detailed and nuanced approaches, especially in tasks requiring color-based differentiation.\n\nc) Example Sentences:\n1. \"Bright-red square find.\" (Find the bright red square.)\n2. \"Darkblue circle move.\" (Move the dark blue circle.)\n3. \"Lightgreen and sunsetorange pieces arrange.\" (Arrange the light green and sunset orange pieces.)\n\n2.

Cognitive Model: Simulates problem-solving strategies influenced by ColorLang\u2019s structure.\n3. Solution Generator: Produces problem-solving approaches and outputs them in ColorLang.\n\nb) Modeling Language Influence:\nThe system models the influence of ColorLang by incorporating a perceptual sensitivity module that enhances attention to color distinctions. This module affects the cognitive model, prioritizing strategies that leverage detailed color differentiation.\n\nc) Novel Techniques:\nThe system uses a novel algorithm called \"Color-Enhanced Problem Solver\" (CEPS), which integrates color perception data into logical reasoning.

The tiles are various shades of red, blue, and green.\n\nb) AI Approach:\nThe AI system first translates the puzzle instructions into ColorLang. It then uses CEPS to analyze the clues, focusing on the fine-grained color distinctions to determine the correct order of tiles.\n\nc) AI's Thought Process:\n1. \"Sunsetorange tile first place.\" (Place the sunset orange tile first.)\n2. \"Darkgreen and lightgreen tiles adjacent put.\" (Put the dark green and light green tiles adjacent.)\n3. \"Bluered tile next after darkblue tile position.\" (Position the bluered tile next after the dark blue tile.)\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\na) Hypothetical Approach in a Language Without Fine-Grained Color Vocabulary:\nIn a language with a basic color vocabulary (e.g., just \"red,\" \"blue,\" and \"green\"), the AI might use broader categories and rely more on positional or shape-based cues rather than color.\n\nb) Differences in Strategy:\nThe approach in ColorLang would involve more precise color-based differentiation, leading to a potentially more accurate and efficient solution. In contrast, the basic color language approach might result in trial-and-error or less optimal arrangements due to the lack of detailed color information.\n\nc) Relation to Linguistic Relativity:\nThese differences illustrate the theory of linguistic relativity, suggesting that the structure of ColorLang enhances perceptual and cognitive abilities related to color, influencing problem-solving strategies towards more detailed and nuanced solutions.\n\n5. Implications and Limitations\n\na) Implications:\nThe findings suggest that language structure can significantly influence cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies. This supports the idea that linguistic relativity extends beyond perceptual tasks to logical reasoning and problem-solving domains.\n\nb) Limitations:\nThe simulation may not fully capture the complexity of human cognition and the influence of other cognitive factors. Additionally, biases in the AI's design and the artificiality of ColorLang may limit the generalizability of the findings.\n\nc) Future Experiments:\nFuture experiments could involve testing human subjects with different linguistic backgrounds on similar tasks to validate the AI's findings. Expanding the AI system to include other structural properties, such as spatial vocabulary, could further explore the breadth of linguistic relativity\u2019s impact on cognition.",

The task demands a high level of creativity, interdisciplinary knowledge, and analytical reasoning that goes beyond typical text generation capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
