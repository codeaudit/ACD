This requires a deep understanding of quantum computing principles, algorithm design, and complexity analysis. It is also an interdisciplinary problem-solving task, which is extremely challenging.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty:** The task is estimated to be very difficult for humans, particularly requiring expertise in both quantum computing and classical algorithm design.\n\n3. **LLM Capabilities:** While LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text and even solving some complex problems, quantum computing is a highly specialized field. The intricate details and deep understanding required for this task could be beyond the current capabilities of even advanced LLMs.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method:** The task is evaluated using the `eval_with_llm_judge` function, which relies on specific criteria to score the submission. This method can be suitable for assessing the LLM's performance if the criteria are well-defined and the evaluation is rigorous.\n\nConsidering these points, it is not surprising that the LLM agent failed at this task. The requirement to deeply understand and integrate quantum and classical computing principles, perform a thorough complexity analysis, and provide innovative solutions is exceptionally demanding. \n\nDecision: No"
