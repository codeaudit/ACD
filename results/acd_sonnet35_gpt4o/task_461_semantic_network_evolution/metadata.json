A semantic network is a graph structure for representing knowledge in patterns of interconnected nodes and arcs, where concepts are represented by nodes and relationships between concepts by arcs.\n\nYour task involves the following steps:\n\n1. Semantic Network Design (200-250 words):\n   a) Starting with the seed concept \"music\", create a semantic network using the provided related concepts: rhythm, melody, instrument, composer, concert, emotion, harmony, genre, performance, sound.\n   b) Explain the relationships between concepts, including hierarchical, associative, and causal connections.\n   c) Describe how you would visually represent this network (e.g., nodes, edges, weights).\n   d) Provide a simple ASCII art representation of your initial semantic network.\n\n2. Network Evolution (200-250 words):\n   a) Propose a method to evolve this semantic network towards the target concept \"quantum physics\".\n   b) Describe 3-4 intermediate steps in this evolution, explaining how new concepts are introduced and connections are formed or strengthened.\n   c) Discuss any cognitive principles or heuristics you're applying in this evolution process.\n\n3. AI Comparison (150-200 words):\n   a) Hypothesize how an AI language model might approach this task of semantic expansion.\n   b) Discuss potential differences between human-designed and AI-generated semantic networks.\n   c) Propose a method to quantitatively compare the two approaches.\n\n4. Cognitive Implications (100-150 words):\n   a) Discuss what this task reveals about human cognition and knowledge representation.\n   b) Explain how this might inform our understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\n5. Practical Applications (100-150 words):\n   a) Propose two practical applications of this semantic network evolution in fields such as education, scientific research, or AI development.\n   b) Briefly explain how each application would work and its potential benefits.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of semantic relationships, cognitive science principles, and AI concepts.
