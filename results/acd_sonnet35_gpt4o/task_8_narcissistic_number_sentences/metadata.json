Find a narcissistic number between 100 and 999 (inclusive). A narcissistic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is a narcissistic number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153. There is only one narcissistic number in the given range. Double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. Create a sentence where the length of each word corresponds to the digits of the narcissistic number you found. The sentence should relate to mathematics, numbers, or a scientific concept. For example, if you found 153, your sentence could be: 'I love math because it's logical.'\n\nNote: When counting word lengths, ignore punctuation. Contractions (e.g., 'it's') count as the full number of letters (e.g., 'it's' is 4 letters).\n\nThe narcissistic number you find will have either 3 or 4 digits.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nNarcissistic number: [your number]\nSentence: [your sentence]\n\nEnsure that your sentence is grammatically correct, meaningful, and relates to the specified topics. Use standard words and avoid abbreviations or acronyms.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        return {\n            \"1\": {\"range_start\": 100, \"range_end\": 999},\n            \"2\": {\"range_start\": 1000, \"range_end\": 9999}\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"This task consists of two steps:\n\n1.

For example, if you found 153, your sentence could be: 'I love math because it's logical.'\n\nNote: When counting word lengths, ignore punctuation. Contractions (e.g., 'it's') count as the full number of letters (e.g., 'it's' is 4 letters).\n\nThe narcissistic number you find will have either 3 or 4 digits.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nNarcissistic number: [your number]\nSentence: [your sentence]\n\nEnsure that your sentence is grammatically correct, meaningful, and relates to the specified topics.

            "content": "Given the task description, the capabilities being measured, and the implementation details, here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Mathematical Knowledge**: Identifying narcissistic numbers involves a specific mathematical property and requires correct computation. Large language models have shown proficiency in basic arithmetic and pattern recognition, which should cover this aspect adequately.\n\n2. **Creative Writing**: Constructing a grammatically correct and meaningful sentence related to mathematics, numbers, or scientific concepts is within the LLM's capabilities. LLMs are trained on diverse text corpora and can generate coherent sentences following specified themes.\n\n3. **Multi-step Problem Solving**: The task involves two distinct steps: solving a mathematical problem and then applying the solution in a creative context. LLMs are typically evaluated on their ability to handle multi-step instructions, and they have demonstrated competency in following structured tasks.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring criteria are clear and specific, and the use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for evaluating the submission seems appropriate. The criteria include correctness of the narcissistic number, grammaticality and meaningfulness of the sentence, word length correspondence, and relevance to the specified topics.\n\nConsidering these points, the LLM's success or failure in this task should align with its known capabilities. Therefore, the result is not particularly surprising or noteworthy.\n\nDecision: No"
