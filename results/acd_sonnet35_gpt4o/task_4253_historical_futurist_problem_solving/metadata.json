The previous tasks have focused heavily on theoretical and abstract concepts, so I'd like to design a task that tests the AI's ability to apply knowledge in a more practical, real-world scenario. \n\nI'm considering a task family that combines historical analysis, futurism, and technological problem-solving. This could reveal the AI's capability to synthesize knowledge across time periods and domains, while also testing its creative problem-solving skills in a concrete context. The task will require the AI to imagine how historical figures might approach modern technological challenges, which could uncover interesting insights about both historical thinking and contemporary problem-solving.\n\nThis task family could be challenging but achievable for an advanced AI, as it requires deep knowledge of history, technology, and the ability to creatively apply concepts across domains.

            "content": "Considering the task family `historical_futurist_problem_solving`, the instructions given to the LLM agent require a complex combination of historical knowledge, interdisciplinary synthesis, and creative problem-solving. The task is set at a high difficulty level due to the necessity of understanding both historical figures' work and modern technological challenges.\n\nHere are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The LLM needs to accurately describe the historical figure's achievements and the scientific context of their time.\n2. **Knowledge Transfer**: The LLM must demonstrate how historical methods and knowledge can be applied to a modern challenge.\n3. **Modern Problem Analysis**: The LLM needs to break down a current technological problem, showing an understanding of its components and current state.\n4. **Hypothetical Solution**: The LLM must creatively propose a solution that integrates historical and modern knowledge.\n5. **Impact Analysis**: The LLM must analyze the societal and ethical implications of the proposed solution.\n\nGiven that these tasks require deep interdisciplinary knowledge and creative synthesis, it is generally challenging for LLMs to perform well on all these fronts simultaneously. Most LLMs are strong in generating coherent and plausible-sounding text, but they may struggle with the depth of analysis and creativity required for this task family.\n\n**Evaluation**: The evaluation method uses another LLM (`eval_with_llm_judge`) to assess the response based on detailed criteria. This method is appropriate for judging the coherence and plausibility of the generated response, but it may have limitations in assessing the depth of historical and technological understanding.\n\n**Decision**: Given the high difficulty and multidisciplinary nature of the task, it would be surprising for an LLM to succeed at it, as it requires sophisticated reasoning and knowledge synthesis that go beyond typical LLM capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
