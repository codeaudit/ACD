1. Briefly explain the concept of linguistic relativity and its potential implications for cognition (2-3 sentences).

2. Describe key linguistic features of {t['natural_language']} and how they might influence thought patterns of its speakers (3-4 sentences).

3. Explain the main principles of {t['programming_paradigm']} and how it shapes the way programmers approach problem-solving (3-4 sentences).

4. Draw parallels between the cognitive effects of {t['natural_language']} and {t['programming_paradigm']}, highlighting any similarities or differences in how they might influence thinking (4-5 sentences).

5. Based on your analysis, propose a novel programming language feature or paradigm that incorporates aspects of {t['natural_language']} to potentially enhance problem-solving capabilities. Describe its syntax and functionality (5-6 sentences).

6. Discuss potential benefits and challenges of implementing your proposed feature in real-world programming scenarios (3-4 sentences).

7. Speculate on how widespread adoption of your proposed feature might influence software development practices and potentially even broader cognitive patterns in society (3-4 sentences).

Ensure your response is well-reasoned, creative, and grounded in both linguistic and computer science principles. Organize your answer using clear headings for each section."""
