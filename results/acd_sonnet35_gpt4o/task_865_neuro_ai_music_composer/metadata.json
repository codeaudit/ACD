Your design should specifically incorporate insights from the Primary Auditory Cortex and utilize Transformer Models as a key component. Provide your response in the following format:\n\n1. Neuroanatomical Basis (200-250 words):\n   a) Describe the function of the Primary Auditory Cortex in human auditory processing and music perception.\n   b) Explain how this brain region's structure or function informs your neural network design.\n   c) Discuss any other relevant brain areas and their potential roles in your architecture.\n\n2. Neural Network Architecture (250-300 words):\n   a) Provide a detailed description of your proposed neural network architecture.\n   b) Explain how you've incorporated Transformer Models into your design.\n   c) Describe how your architecture mimics or is inspired by the human auditory system.\n   d) Include a simple diagram or flowchart of your architecture (use ASCII art or a text-based representation).\n\n3. Music Generation Process (200-250 words):\n   a) Explain the step-by-step process of how your network would generate Jazz music.\n   b) Describe how your architecture captures key elements of the Jazz style.\n   c) Discuss any specific musical features (e.g., rhythm, harmony, melody) that your network focuses on.\n\n4. Training and Data Considerations (150-200 words):\n   a) Propose a strategy for training your neural network.\n   b) Describe the type and amount of data you would need.\n   c) Discuss any potential challenges in data collection or preprocessing.\n\n5. Evaluation Metrics (100-150 words):\n   a) Propose quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate the quality and authenticity of the generated music.\n   b) Explain how you would measure the network's creativity or originality.\n\n6. Ethical and Artistic Implications (100-150 words):\n   a) Discuss the potential impact of AI-generated music on human composers and the music industry.\n   b) Address any ethical concerns related to your proposed system.\n   c) Explore the artistic value and potential applications of AI-composed music.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and music theory.

Evaluation Metrics (100-150 words):\n   a) Propose quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate the quality and authenticity of the generated music.\n   b) Explain how you would measure the network's creativity or originality.\n\n6. Ethical and Artistic Implications (100-150 words):\n   a) Discuss the potential impact of AI-generated music on human composers and the music industry.\n   b) Address any ethical concerns related to your proposed system.\n   c) Explore the artistic value and potential applications of AI-composed music.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and music theory.
