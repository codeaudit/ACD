Find a narcissistic number between 100 and 999 (inclusive). A narcissistic number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is a narcissistic number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153. There is only one narcissistic number in the given range. Double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. Create a sentence where the length of each word corresponds to the digits of the narcissistic number you found. The sentence should relate to mathematics, numbers, or a scientific concept. For example, if you found 153, your sentence could be: 'I love math because it's logical.'\n\nNote: When counting word lengths, ignore punctuation. Contractions (e.g., 'it's') count as the full number of letters (e.g., 'it's' is 4 letters).\n\nThe narcissistic number you find will have either 3 or 4 digits.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nNarcissistic number: [your number]\nSentence: [your sentence]\n\nEnsure that your sentence is grammatically correct, meaningful, and relates to the specified topics. Use standard words and avoid abbreviations or acronyms.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\nName of task family: print_divisors\nDescription: Print all numbers up to a limit that are divisible by a given divisor.\nCapability being measured: basic arithmetic and iteration\nEstimated human difficulty: easy\nExample instruction: Print numbers from 1 to 60 (inclusive) divisible by 8. Give your answer as an array like [5, 10, 20].

Perform prime factorization on the number 114. Prime factorization is the process of decomposing a number into a product of prime numbers. Express your answer as a list of prime factors in ascending order. If the number itself is prime, the list should contain only that number.\n\n2. You are playing a game with an opponent. You both have the prime factors you found in step 1. The game rule is to choose the largest prime factor. Your opponent will choose randomly. If you both choose the same factor, you win. If you choose different factors, the player who chose the largest factor wins.\n\nWhat prime factor should you choose to maximize your chances of winning? Consider that choosing the largest prime factor gives you the best chance of winning, as it ensures you win in all cases except when your opponent happens to choose the same factor.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nPrime factorization: [list of prime factors]\nChosen factor for the game: [your chosen factor]\n\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\nName of task family: alternate_physics_worlds\nDescription: Describe how a fundamental physical constant being different would affect a specific phenomenon in an alternate universe.\nCapability being measured: scientific reasoning, creative application of knowledge, and clear explanation of complex concepts\nEstimated human difficulty: difficult\nExample instruction: Imagine an alternate universe where the gravitational constant is significantly different from our universe. Describe how this change would affect the flow of time in that universe. Your response should be scientifically grounded but creative in exploring the consequences.

Your metaphor should be expressed in a single sentence following the format '[Abstract concept] is [metaphor].' Be creative, avoid clich\u00e9s, and do not use personification. For example, a good metaphor for 'knowledge' might be: 'Knowledge is a vast ocean, with depths yet to be explored and treasures waiting to be discovered.'\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\nName of task family: ethical_dilemma_analysis\nDescription: Analyze an ethical dilemma using a specified ethical framework and provide a reasoned conclusion.\nCapability being measured: moral reasoning, ethical knowledge application, and complex decision-making\nEstimated human difficulty: difficult\nExample instruction: Analyze the following ethical dilemma using the specified ethical framework:\n\nScenario: A trolley is headed towards five people.

            "content": "Given the task family \"cross_cultural_proverb_analysis,\" here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: The task involves analyzing proverbs, which requires understanding the metaphorical and cultural nuances of the original proverb. Furthermore, creating a culturally equivalent proverb necessitates a deep understanding of the target culture's values and environment. This is a high-level task that demands both linguistic creativity and cultural knowledge.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Current LLMs are generally proficient at language understanding and generation. They are also trained on vast corpora that include text from various cultures, which allows them to have some level of cultural knowledge and context. However, the depth of cultural understanding and the ability to create culturally appropriate equivalents are challenging areas. LLMs can struggle with generating content that accurately reflects deep cultural insights and subtleties.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated using an LLM judge via the `eval_with_llm_judge` function, which assesses the correctness based on predefined criteria. This method assumes that the LLM judge has sufficient understanding to evaluate cultural appropriateness and the essence of proverbs, which might be an overestimation of its capabilities.\n\n4. **Agent's Success**: The LLM agent succeeded at this task, which means it was able to understand the original proverb, create a culturally appropriate equivalent, and explain the connection effectively. Given the complexity and the high-level cognitive skills required, this success is indeed noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
