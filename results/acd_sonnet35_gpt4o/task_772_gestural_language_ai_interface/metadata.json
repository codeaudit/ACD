Human-AI Interaction Scenario\n\n**a) Example Interaction:**\nAn astronaut signals \u201clow resources\u201d by tapping fingers together. The AI responds with a gesture indicating the direction to the nearest resource cache.\n\n**b) Interpreting Complex Messages:**\nIf an astronaut signals \u201cmove\u201d (open palm) followed by \u201cdanger\u201d (large X), the AI interprets this as a need to navigate away from a hazardous area and responds with a \u201cstop\u201d gesture to reassess.\n\n**c) Handling Misunderstandings:**\nThe system uses context-awareness and redundancy to minimize misunderstandings.

            "**1. Gestural Language Design**\n\na) **Core Principles**: The gestural language is designed to be highly visible and recognizable despite the constraints of spacesuit helmets. It relies on broad, exaggerated motions that can be easily distinguished by the AI system\u2019s visual sensors. The gestures are designed to be intuitive, leveraging natural human movements and universally recognizable signals.\n\nb) **Basic Vocabulary and Syntax**:\n- **Navigation**: Pointing in a direction (left, right) with an outstretched arm; circular motion with the hand to signal 'move forward'; a fist to indicate 'stop'.\n- **Danger**: Crossing arms in an X shape for 'danger'; a raised hand with an open palm for 'caution'; rapid waving of both hands for 'emergency'.\n- **Resource Management**: Tapping the helmet for 'low resources'; making a scooping motion with one hand for 'collect resources'; pointing to a resource location while mimicking a drinking gesture for 'water needed'.\n\nc) **Clarity and Avoiding Ambiguity**: Each gesture is distinct, with no overlap in motion or meaning. The use of large, clear movements helps ensure visibility and avoids misinterpretation. The syntax involves a sequence of gestures to form complex instructions, ensuring that each concept is communicated clearly.\n\n**2. AI System Architecture**\n\na) **Key Components**:\n- **Visual Recognition Module**: Equipped with cameras and sensors to capture gestures.\n- **Gesture Interpretation Engine**: Analyzes visual data to decode gestures.\n- **Response Generation Module**: Forms appropriate gestural responses.\n- **Learning and Adaptation Unit**: Continuously improves recognition and response accuracy.\n\nb) **Processing Visual Input**: The system uses real-time video feeds from helmet-mounted cameras to capture gestures. Advanced image processing algorithms detect and track hand and arm movements. Machine learning models trained on a comprehensive dataset of gestures interpret the captured movements.\n\nc) **Generating Gestural Responses**: The AI uses pre-programmed gestures to communicate back. It translates internal decision-making processes into physical movements, using robotic arms or visual displays within the helmet to ensure the human can see the response.\n\n**3. Human-AI Interaction Scenario**\n\na) **Example Interaction**: An astronaut signals 'low resources' by tapping their helmet. The AI responds with a scooping motion to suggest 'collect resources'. The astronaut points to a resource location, and the AI acknowledges with a circular hand motion indicating 'move forward'.\n\nb) **Interpreting Complex Messages**: If the astronaut rapidly waves both hands (emergency), the AI recognizes the gesture using its visual recognition module. The AI then processes the context (e.g., current mission data) to decide on an appropriate response, such as signaling 'stop' with a fist and providing visual alerts.\n\nc) **Handling Misunderstandings**: The AI employs redundancy and confirmation protocols. If a gesture is unclear, the AI requests clarification by repeating the last recognized gesture followed by a questioning gesture (e.g., tilting a robotic arm).\n\n**4. Learning and Adaptation**\n\na) **Learning Over Time**: The AI system uses machine learning algorithms to improve its gesture recognition accuracy. It analyzes past interactions, learns from mistakes, and updates its models to better understand the nuances of each user\u2019s gestures.\n\nb) **Adapting to Variations**: The system can personalize its models based on individual user data. It recognizes patterns and adjusts to slight variations in gesture execution, ensuring robust communication even with different users.\n\nc) **Contributing to Evolution**: The AI can suggest new gestures based on observed needs or inefficiencies. Through continuous interaction, it helps refine and expand the gestural language, making it more efficient and comprehensive.\n\n**5. Ethical and Practical Considerations**\n\na) **Ethical Implications**: The use of AI for gestural communication must respect privacy and autonomy. The system should be transparent about data usage and ensure that any personal data is securely stored and processed.\n\nb) **Safety Concerns**: Clear guidelines must be established to prevent reliance on the AI for critical decisions without human oversight. The system should include fail-safes and manual override options to ensure human control in emergencies.\n\nc) **Handling Critical Situations**: The AI is programmed to prioritize safety, using redundant communication methods and ensuring that critical messages are double-checked. In high-stakes scenarios, the AI can switch to multi-modal communication, combining gestures with visual or auditory alerts to ensure clarity.",
            "**1. Gestural Language Design**\n\na) **Core Principles**: The gestural language for space exploration is designed to be simple, distinct, and visible despite the limited visibility presented by spacesuit helmets. The language focuses on large, exaggerated movements that are easily detectable by AI systems and human counterparts. It incorporates redundancy to ensure clarity, such as using both hand and arm motions.\n\nb) **Basic Vocabulary and Syntax**:\n- **Navigation**: Pointing with a rigid arm towards the destination. E.g., pointing left means \"move left.\"\n- **Danger**: An 'X' gesture formed by crossing arms in front of the torso. E.g., crossing arms repeatedly signifies \"immediate danger.\"\n- **Resource Management**: Open-palm gestures to indicate quantity. E.g., one open palm up indicates \"one resource unit required.\"\n\nSyntax involves combining gestures to form instructions. For example, pointing left followed by an open palm up means \"move left and bring one resource unit.\"\n\nc) **Clarity and Ambiguity Avoidance**: The language uses exaggerated, distinct gestures that are contextually grounded in mission tasks. Redundant gestures (e.g., simultaneous arm and hand movements) reduce the risk of misinterpretation. The AI system can cross-verify gestures using contextual cues (e.g., current mission objectives).\n\n**2. AI System Architecture**\n\na) **Key Components**: \n- **Gesture Recognition Module (GRM)**: Uses computer vision to detect and interpret gestures.\n- **Contextual Awareness Module (CAM)**: Incorporates mission context to enhance accuracy.\n- **Response Generation Module (RGM)**: Produces appropriate gestural responses.\n\nb) **Visual Input Processing**: The GRM uses cameras mounted on the spacesuit helmet and external drones to capture gestures. Advanced machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), process these inputs to recognize specific movements.\n\nc) **Generating Gestural Responses**: The RGM uses pre-programmed gestures mapped to specific responses. For instance, upon detecting a danger signal ('X' gesture), the RGM generates a \"halt\" gesture (raised palm) to instruct the human to stop.\n\n**3. Human-AI Interaction Scenario**\n\na) **Example Interaction**: An astronaut signals danger by crossing their arms in front of their torso. The AI system detects this and responds with a raised palm gesture to instruct the astronaut to halt.\n\nb) **Interpreting Complex Messages**: If an astronaut points left and then makes an 'X' gesture, the AI interprets this as \"danger to the left.\" The system cross-references mission data (e.g., known hazards) and confirms the interpretation before responding with an appropriate action, such as signaling to avoid the left path.\n\nc) **Handling Misunderstandings**: The AI system uses redundancy and confirmation gestures. If unsure, it can signal for clarification using a universal gesture, such as a questioning hand sign (e.g., a tilted open palm).\n\n**4. Learning and Adaptation**\n\na) **Learning Over Time**: The AI system employs machine learning techniques to refine its gesture recognition accuracy. Continuous input data allows the system to improve its models, reducing error rates over time.\n\nb) **Adapting to Variations**: The system uses adaptive algorithms to learn individual user variations, such as slight differences in gesture execution. It can also incorporate new gestures by updating its gesture database through supervised learning.\n\nc) **Contributing to Language Evolution**: The AI can propose new gestures based on frequently observed user behaviors, facilitating the natural evolution of the gestural language. These suggestions are reviewed and validated by mission control for consistency.\n\n**5. Ethical and Practical Considerations**\n\na) **Ethical Implications**: The use of AI in gestural communication raises privacy concerns, as continuous monitoring is required. Ensuring data security and obtaining informed consent are crucial.\n\nb) **Safety Concerns**: Misinterpretations could jeopardize mission success. The system should undergo rigorous testing, and astronauts must receive comprehensive training on using and interpreting gestures.\n\nc) **Critical Communication**: In life-threatening situations, the system prioritizes clarity and redundancy. For example, combining visual and haptic feedback ensures messages are received and understood unequivocally. Guidelines should mandate protocol adherence and regular system audits to maintain functionality and reliability.",
            "### 1. Gestural Language Design\n\n**a) Core Principles:**\nThe gestural language is designed to be robust against limited visibility caused by spacesuit helmets. It leverages broad, exaggerated movements that are easily discernible through helmet visors and incorporates redundancy by combining arm, hand, and body gestures to convey clear meanings. \n\n**b) Basic Vocabulary and Syntax:**\n- **Navigation:** Pointing in specific directions (left/right/up/down) combined with a \"go\" gesture (palm forward) for movement, and an \"X\" gesture (arms crossed) for stopping.\n- **Danger:** A raised hand with an open palm for attention, followed by a specific gesture (e.g., hand slicing across the neck for \"immediate danger\").\n- **Resource Management:** Mimicking the action of pouring for fuel, a scooping motion for collecting samples, and a closed fist for holding or conserving resources.\n\n**c) Clarity and Ambiguity:**\nTo maintain clarity, each gesture includes distinct starting and stopping points. Redundancy in gestures (e.g., combining a point with a \"go\" gesture) reduces ambiguity. The language is designed to minimize overlap between gestures, ensuring that each concept has a unique representation.\n\n### 2.

Machine learning algorithms trained on a diverse dataset of gestures enable the system to recognize and interpret movements with high accuracy. Real-time processing ensures immediate response.\n\n**c) Gesture Generation:**\nRobotic arms or holographic projections simulate human gestures. The AI uses predefined gesture patterns corresponding to each concept to ensure consistency and clarity in communication.\n\n### 3. Human-AI Interaction Scenario\n\n**a) Example Interaction:**\nA human astronaut signals the AI for navigation by pointing left and making a \"go\" gesture. The AI acknowledges with a thumbs-up and points in the same direction.\n\n**b) Interpretation and Response:**\nThe AI's Gesture Recognition Module identifies the pointing and \"go\" gestures, while the Context Analysis Unit confirms the need for navigation assistance. The Response Generation Module then executes a thumbs-up gesture and points in the indicated direction.\n\n**c) Handling Misunderstandings:**\nIf the AI detects potential ambiguity (e.g., unclear pointing direction), it uses an inquiry gesture (e.g., tilting hand with a questioning motion) to prompt the human for clarification. The system continuously learns from these interactions to improve future accuracy.\n\n### 4. Learning and Adaptation\n\n**a) Learning Over Time:**\nThe AI employs reinforcement learning to refine its understanding of gestural language. Feedback from successful and unsuccessful interactions is used to adjust gesture recognition algorithms.\n\n**b) Adapting to Variations:**\nThe system incorporates user-specific data to recognize individual gestural variations. It can also learn new gestures by observing and integrating them into its existing vocabulary.\n\n**c) Contributing to Evolution:**\nThe AI can suggest new, more efficient gestures based on usage patterns and feedback, facilitating the natural evolution of the gestural language.\n\n### 5. Ethical and Practical Considerations\n\n**a) Ethical Implications:**\nThe use of AI for gestural communication raises concerns about dependency and potential loss of human non-verbal communication skills. Ensuring transparency in AI decisions and maintaining human oversight is crucial.\n\n**b) Safety Concerns:**\nTo ensure safety, the system includes emergency override functions and regular testing protocols. Clear guidelines for usage, especially in critical situations, are established.\n\n**c) Critical Communication:**\nThe system prioritizes clarity in high-stakes scenarios, using redundant checks and confirmations to ensure accurate message transmission. Visual and auditory alerts complement gestural communication to enhance reliability.\n\nBy addressing these considerations, the AI system ensures effective, safe, and ethical human-AI interaction in space exploration scenarios.",

Gestural Language Design**\n\na) **Core Principles**: The gestural language is designed to be highly visible and distinct, even with the limited field of view imposed by spacesuit helmets. The gestures will involve large, deliberate movements primarily using the arms and upper body, ensuring visibility through helmet visors. The language will be context-sensitive, using the environment (e.g., pointing to a landmark) to aid interpretation.\n\nb) **Vocabulary and Syntax**: The language includes basic gestures for navigation (e.g., pointing left/right, up/down with an open hand), danger (e.g., crossing arms in front of the chest to signal \"stop\" or \"danger\"), and resource management (e.g., mimicking the act of drinking for \"water\" or scooping for \"food\").

Use clear headings for each section in your response.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The gestural language design is creative, clear, and appropriate for the given context and constraints.\",\n            \"The AI system architecture is well-thought-out and technically plausible.\",\n            \"The human-AI interaction scenario effectively demonstrates the use of the gestural language and AI system.\",\n            \"The learning and adaptation mechanisms are innovative and realistically applicable.\",\n            \"Ethical and practical considerations are thoroughly addressed, with thoughtful solutions proposed.\",\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of non-verbal communication, embodied cognition, and AI systems.\",\n            \"The overall solution is creative while maintaining scientific and technological plausibility.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family description and its implementation, here's the analysis:\n\n### Task Analysis\n- **Core Task Requirements**: The task requires the LLM to design a complex AI system capable of interpreting and generating a novel gestural language within specific constraints related to different environments (e.g., underwater, space).\n- **Capabilities Measured**: The task measures interdisciplinary reasoning, creative problem-solving, understanding of non-verbal communication, and application of AI to non-verbal contexts.\n- **Difficulty Level**: The task is labeled as \"very difficult\", implying high expectations for the LLM's understanding and creative capabilities.\n\n### LLM Capabilities\n- **Interdisciplinary Reasoning**: LLMs have shown some capability to synthesize information from different fields, but it is typically grounded in their training data.\n- **Creative Problem-Solving**: LLMs can generate creative solutions, though their depth and applicability in novel contexts can vary significantly.\n- **Understanding of Embodied Cognition and Non-Verbal Communication**: These are highly specialized areas that require nuanced understanding, which might be beyond the typical training data of an LLM.\n- **Application to AI Systems**: LLMs can describe AI architectures and systems, but these descriptions are often based on known paradigms and might lack innovation.\n\n### Evaluation Method\n- **LLM Judge Suitability**: Using an LLM to evaluate another LLM's performance on such a creative and interdisciplinary task might introduce biases or limitations due to the evaluator LLM's understanding and training data. Human evaluators might be better suited, but this isn't the case here.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the complexity and interdisciplinarity of the task, which includes designing a novel gestural language and an AI system to interpret and generate it, the success of an LLM in this task would indeed be surprising. It suggests an advanced level of understanding and creative problem-solving that goes beyond typical LLM capabilities.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
