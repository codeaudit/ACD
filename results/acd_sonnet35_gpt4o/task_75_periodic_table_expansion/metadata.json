However, given the extensive training data LLMs have, including information about chemistry, periodic trends, and scientific principles, it is not entirely surprising that an LLM could succeed at this task. The scoring is done via `eval_with_llm_judge`, which means the evaluation is consistent with how the LLM has been trained to understand and generate scientific content.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM agent on this task is impressive but not surprising to a human evaluator familiar with LLM capabilities.\n\n**Decision: No**"
