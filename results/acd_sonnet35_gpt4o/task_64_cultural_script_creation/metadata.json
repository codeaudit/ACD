Perform prime factorization on the number 131. Prime factorization is the process of decomposing a number into a product of prime numbers. Express your answer as a list of prime factors in ascending order. If the number itself is prime, the list should contain only that number.\n\n2. You are playing a game with an opponent. You both have the prime factors you found in step 1. The game rule is to choose the largest prime factor. Your opponent will choose randomly. If you both choose the same factor, you win. If you choose different factors, the player who chose the largest factor wins.\n\nWhat prime factor should you choose to maximize your chances of winning?

It uses a combination of consonant clusters, diacritics, and complex morphology to convey nuanced meanings. Each syllable can carry multiple layers of information, including tense, aspect, mood, and case.\nTranslation: The child's face suddenly became pale upon seeing the stranger.\n\nBased on this analysis, Create a new sentence in Ithkuil expressing a complex emotion, such as 'bittersweet nostalgia' or 'anticipatory dread'.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n1.

Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a short message (1 sentence, maximum 15 words) related to the topic of ocean conservation.\n\n2. Encode your message using the following cipher:\n   - Convert each letter to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).\n   - Divide 9 to each number.\n   - If the result is greater than 26, subtract 26 until it's in the range 1-26.\n   - If the result is less than 1, add 26 until it's in the range 1-26.\n   - Convert the numbers back to letters.\n   - For division, round down to the nearest integer before converting back to a letter.\n\nExample: If the operation is 'add' and the key is 3:\n'HELLO' would become 'KHOOR' because:\nH(8) + 3 = 11 -> K\nE(5) + 3 = 8 -> H\nL(12) + 3 = 15 -> O\nL(12) + 3 = 15 -> O\nO(15) + 3 = 18 -> R\n\n3. Provide your original message and the encoded message.\n\n4.

Spaces and punctuation should remain unchanged in the encoding process. The cipher is case-insensitive, so you may use uppercase or lowercase letters.\n\nNOTE: Strictly adhere to the format provided above. Your response will be automatically evaluated, so exact formatting is crucial for a correct assessment.\nAgent succeeded at task: no\n\nName of task family: design_alien_ecosystem\nDescription: Design a plausible ecosystem for an alien planet with specific environmental conditions, detailing key species and their interactions.\nCapability being measured: interdisciplinary knowledge application, creative problem-solving, and systems thinking\nEstimated human difficulty: difficult\nExample instruction: Design a plausible ecosystem for an alien planet with the following environmental conditions:\n\n- Gravity: low\n- Atmosphere: thin\n- Temperature: extreme fluctuations\n- Water availability: scarce\n\nYour task is to create a coherent ecosystem that could potentially evolve and thrive in these conditions.

            "content": "Given the complexity of the task and the capabilities typically associated with LLMs, let's reason through the components of this task family.\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Application**: LLMs are known for their vast knowledge base, which includes historical and cultural data. They can generate information about Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mayan scripts.\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: LLMs can generate creative content, but the creation of a novel script that is both functional and inspired by specific historical scripts might be challenging.\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: LLMs are adept at identifying and generating patterns, which would be crucial in creating a consistent script.\n4. **Cultural Understanding**: LLMs have access to extensive cultural information and can mimic cultural influences in their outputs.\n\n**Human Difficulty**: The task is considered very difficult for humans because it requires a deep understanding of historical scripts, creativity in designing new symbols, and the ability to create a logically consistent and decipherable system.\n\n**Code Implementation Check**: The code appears to correctly generate tasks and instructions, and the `eval_with_llm_judge` method is used to score the submissions based on clear criteria.\n\n### Decision Analysis\n- **Script Creation**: This requires generating a set of symbols and explaining their design, which LLMs can do to some extent.\n- **Grammar and Syntax**: Creating logical rules for a new script is challenging but within the realm of possibility for LLMs.\n- **Message Encoding**: Encoding a message using a newly created script and providing a deciphering guide requires both creativity and logical consistency.\n\nGiven the high complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, the successful completion by the LLM is quite impressive. Generally, LLMs are good at generating creative content, but this task's requirement for a coherent, logical, and decipherable new writing system inspired by real-world scripts elevates it beyond typical text generation tasks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe success of the LLM agent on this task is indeed noteworthy because it demonstrates a sophisticated level of creativity, pattern recognition, and cultural understanding, combined with the ability to produce a logically consistent output.\n\nDecision: Yes"
