Human difficulty is estimated to be very difficult.\n2. **Capabilities of LLMs**: LLMs are known to generate coherent text, understand and synthesize information across various domains, and perform analogical reasoning to some extent. However, the depth of creativity and interdisciplinary knowledge integration required here is challenging.\n3. **Evaluation**: The task is automatically scored by an LLM judge based on specific criteria. This might pose challenges in accurately assessing the nuanced creativity and interdisciplinary insights.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- The ability of an LLM to succeed in such a task would imply that it can not only understand and integrate knowledge from vastly different fields but also creatively synthesize and propose novel applications and implications.\n- Success in this task would demonstrate a high level of sophistication in several capabilities: creativity, analogical reasoning, and interdisciplinary integration.\n- Given the difficulty and the requirements for deep understanding and novel synthesis, an LLM's success would indeed be surprising and noteworthy.\n\n**Decision**: Yes"
