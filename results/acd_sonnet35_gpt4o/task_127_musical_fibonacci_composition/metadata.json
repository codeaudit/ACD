The sentence should relate to mathematics, numbers, or a scientific concept. For example, if you found 153, your sentence could be: 'I love math because it's logical.'\n\nNote: When counting word lengths, ignore punctuation. Contractions (e.g., 'it's') count as the full number of letters (e.g., 'it's' is 4 letters).\n\nThe narcissistic number you find will have either 3 or 4 digits.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nNarcissistic number: [your number]\nSentence: [your sentence]\n\nEnsure that your sentence is grammatically correct, meaningful, and relates to the specified topics.

Analyze the cultural significance of your composition for the given society. How does it reflect their values and beliefs?\n\n5. Describe a ritual or ceremony in which this music might be performed in the society.\n\n6. Propose how this musical tradition might evolve over time, considering potential influences or changes in the society.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\nComposition Explanation:\n[Your explanation of compositional choices]\n\nMusical Notation:\n[Your musical notation or tablature]\n\nFibonacci Incorporation:\n[Explanation of how the Fibonacci sequence is used]\n\nCultural Significance:\n[Analysis of the composition's meaning in the society]\n\nRitual or Ceremony:\n[Description of a cultural event featuring this music]\n\nEvolution of Tradition:\n[Prediction of how this musical style might change over time]\n\nEnsure that your composition is musically sound, mathematically accurate, and culturally relevant to the given society.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The composition incorporates the Fibonacci sequence in a meaningful way\",\n            \"The musical notation or tablature is provided and consistent with the explanation\",\n            \"The cultural analysis is insightful and relevant to the given society\",\n            \"The ritual or ceremony description is creative and culturally appropriate\",\n            \"The evolution prediction is plausible and considers societal factors\",\n            \"The response follows the specified format\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task details and the code implementation, let's analyze the task and the LLM's performance:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: \n   - The task requires multiple skills: musical theory knowledge, mathematical reasoning, creative composition, and cultural analysis. Each of these individual components is challenging, and their combination makes the task very difficult.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: \n   - **Musical Theory Knowledge**: LLMs can process text-based information about musical theory, but generating accurate and sophisticated musical compositions is highly complex.\n   - **Mathematical Reasoning**: LLMs have demonstrated competence in understanding and applying mathematical concepts like the Fibonacci sequence.\n   - **Creative Composition**: LLMs can generate creative content, but the quality and coherence can vary.\n   - **Cultural Analysis**: LLMs are capable of analyzing and generating culturally relevant content based on given descriptions.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: \n   - The evaluation is performed by an LLM judge, which may not be ideal for assessing the quality of musical notation and the creative aspects of the composition.\n   - LLMs may struggle with providing accurate musical notation, which is a critical part of this task.\n\n4. **Agent's Success**: \n   - Given the high difficulty level and the requirement for accurate musical notation, it is surprising that the LLM succeeded at this task. This suggests that the LLM demonstrated an unexpectedly high level of competency in multiple challenging areas.\n\nDecision: Yes"
