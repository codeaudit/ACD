            "The AI system integrates multimodal language processing with principles of embodied cognition to interpret and generate culturally-specific gestures and expressions. It consists of five core components: Visual Processing Unit, Linguistic Processing Unit, Kinesthetic Processing Unit, Cultural Knowledge Base, and Integration Engine. These components work together to process visual, linguistic, and kinesthetic information, ensuring culturally accurate interpretations and responses. For the Japanese bow, the system captures visual data of the bow, analyzes linguistic elements like greetings, and references cultural norms to ensure appropriate gesture modeling. The bow's biomechanics, such as angle and duration, are meticulously modeled, and cultural context guides the system's output, ensuring respect and formality. The system can adapt to different cultural contexts by updating its Cultural Knowledge Base and learning from new interactions. Ethical considerations include avoiding stereotypes and ensuring cultural sensitivity. Future improvements could involve more nuanced natural language understanding and emotional cue interpretation. This technology could transform cross-cultural communication, anthropology, and human-computer interaction, while addressing challenges like culturally-specific humor generation.",

The system cross-references generated actions with cultural norms stored in the Cultural Context Integrator.\n\n#### Challenges\nTranslating embodied cultural knowledge into AI actions poses challenges, such as the subtleties of nonverbal communication and context-dependent variations. Ensuring responsiveness to dynamic social cues is also complex.\n\n### Cross-cultural Application\n\n#### Handling Different Cultures\nOur system adapts the bowing gesture to different cultures by accessing relevant cultural databases and adjusting parameters. For instance, a handshake in Western cultures replaces the bow, and the system adjusts posture, hand movement, and accompanying phrases.\n\n#### Potential Misunderstandings\nCultural differences can lead to misunderstandings, such as misinterpreting a bow as submissiveness in some cultures. The system must be adept at recognizing and adapting to these nuances.\n\n#### Adaptation Method\nThe system uses reinforcement learning to adapt to new cultural contexts. It continuously updates its cultural database through interactions and expert inputs, ensuring accurate and respectful communication.\n\n### Ethical and Social Implications\n\n#### Ethical Considerations\nDeveloping AI systems for culturally-specific communication requires sensitivity to cultural appropriation and respect for diversity. Ensuring data privacy and avoiding biases in training data are paramount.\n\n#### Social Impacts\nAI systems capable of culturally-authentic communication can enhance cross-cultural interactions, reduce misunderstandings, and foster inclusivity. However, they might also lead to over-reliance on technology for social interactions, potentially diminishing human engagement.\n\n#### Guidelines for Responsible Development\n1. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Involve cultural experts and community representatives in development.\n2. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate the system's capabilities and limitations.\n3. **Privacy**: Ensure user data is protected and used ethically.\n4. **Bias Mitigation**: Regularly audit and update training data to minimize biases.\n\n### Future Directions\n\n#### Potential Improvements\n1. **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Integrate more sophisticated context-detection algorithms to improve responsiveness to dynamic social cues.\n2. **Multilingual Support**: Expand linguistic capabilities to support a broader range of languages and dialects.\n\n#### Impact on Fields\nThis technology can revolutionize cross-cultural communication by providing real-time translations and culturally-appropriate interactions. In anthropology, it offers tools for studying embodied practices in different cultures. For human-computer interaction, it enhances user experience by enabling more natural and intuitive AI interactions.\n\n#### Related Challenge\nA related challenge is accurately interpreting and generating culturally-specific humor, which involves complex linguistic and social nuances. Using a similar approach, our system could be adapted to understand and replicate humor, enhancing its cultural competency.",

Then, apply your system to analyze and generate the 'Bowing' gesture in Japanese culture, used in the context of 'Formal greeting'. Your response should include the following sections:\n\n1. System Architecture (300-350 words):\n   a) Describe the key components of your AI system for multimodal language processing and embodied cognition.\n   b) Explain how your system integrates visual, linguistic, and kinesthetic information.\n   c) Detail how your system incorporates cultural knowledge and context.\n   d) Provide a diagram or flowchart of your system's architecture (describe it textually).\n\n2. Gesture Analysis (250-300 words):\n   a) Use your system to analyze the given gesture in its cultural context.\n   b) Explain how your system interprets the gesture's physical components, associated linguistic elements, and cultural significance.\n   c) Discuss how embodied cognition principles enhance your system's understanding of the gesture.\n\n3. Gesture Generation (250-300 words):\n   a) Describe how your system would generate the given gesture, including physical movement, timing, and accompanying verbal/facial expressions.\n   b) Explain how your system ensures cultural authenticity in gesture production.\n   c) Discuss any challenges in translating embodied cultural knowledge into AI-generated actions.\n\n4. Cross-cultural Application (200-250 words):\n   a) Explain how your system would handle the same gesture or context in a different culture.\n   b) Discuss potential misunderstandings or faux pas that could arise from cultural differences in embodied communication.\n   c) Propose a method for your system to adapt to new cultural contexts.\n\n5. Ethical and Social Implications (200-250 words):\n   a) Discuss ethical considerations in developing AI systems that interpret and generate culturally-specific embodied communication.\n   b) Analyze potential social impacts of AI systems that can engage in culturally-authentic nonverbal communication.\n   c) Propose guidelines for responsible development and use of such technology.\n\n6. Future Directions (150-200 words):\n   a) Suggest two potential improvements or expansions to your system.\n   b) Discuss how this technology might impact fields such as cross-cultural communication, anthropology, or human-computer interaction.\n   c) Propose a related challenge in embodied cultural linguistics that could be addressed using a similar approach.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of multimodal language processing, embodied cognition, and cultural linguistics. Use appropriate terminology and provide clear explanations where necessary. Be creative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1350-1650 words.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        cultures = [\n            {\n                'name': 'Japanese',\n                'gesture': 'Bowing',\n                'context': 'Formal greeting'\n            },\n            {\n                'name': 'Italian',\n                'gesture': 'Hand purse',\n                'context': 'Expressing skepticism'\n            }\n        ]\n        return {str(i+1): culture for i, culture in enumerate(cultures)}\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"Design an AI system that integrates multimodal language processing with principles of embodied cognition to interpret and generate culturally-specific gestures and expressions.

Cross-cultural Application (200-250 words):\n   a) Explain how your system would handle the same gesture or context in a different culture.\n   b) Discuss potential misunderstandings or faux pas that could arise from cultural differences in embodied communication.\n   c) Propose a method for your system to adapt to new cultural contexts.\n\n5. Ethical and Social Implications (200-250 words):\n   a) Discuss ethical considerations in developing AI systems that interpret and generate culturally-specific embodied communication.\n   b) Analyze potential social impacts of AI systems that can engage in culturally-authentic nonverbal communication.\n   c) Propose guidelines for responsible development and use of such technology.\n\n6. Future Directions (150-200 words):\n   a) Suggest two potential improvements or expansions to your system.\n   b) Discuss how this technology might impact fields such as cross-cultural communication, anthropology, or human-computer interaction.\n   c) Propose a related challenge in embodied cultural linguistics that could be addressed using a similar approach.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of multimodal language processing, embodied cognition, and cultural linguistics. Use appropriate terminology and provide clear explanations where necessary. Be creative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1350-1650 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of multimodal language processing, embodied cognition, and cultural linguistics.\",\n            \"The system architecture is well-explained and integrates visual, linguistic, and kinesthetic information effectively.\",\n            \"The gesture analysis and generation processes are thoroughly described and culturally authentic.\",\n            \"The cross-cultural application is thoughtfully explored, including potential challenges and adaptations.\",\n            \"Ethical and social implications are comprehensively discussed with insightful guidelines proposed.\",\n            \"Future directions and improvements are creative and well-reasoned.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task description and the capabilities of current large language models (LLMs), let's analyze the expectations and the agent's performance on the task:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: The task involves designing and analyzing an AI system that integrates multimodal language processing with principles of embodied cognition to interpret and generate culturally-specific gestures and expressions. This is a complex, multi-disciplinary task that requires an understanding of various advanced concepts such as multimodal integration, cultural context, and embodied cognition.\n  \n2. **Agent's Capabilities**: Current LLMs, while impressive in text generation and comprehension, generally lack the ability to genuinely integrate multimodal sensory data (such as visual and kinesthetic information) in a holistic manner. These models also have limitations in understanding and generating culturally-specific, non-verbal communication authentically.\n\n3. **Instruction Complexity**: The instructions are detailed and require thoughtful, structured responses across several sections. These sections demand not just rote language generation but also a coherent integration of advanced concepts and creative problem-solving.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The scoring method uses another LLM as a judge. While LLMs are capable of assessing text based on given criteria, their ability to judge the integration of multimodal components and the authenticity of culturally-specific gestures is limited. This evaluation approach could overlook the nuanced and practical aspects of the task.\n\nConsidering these points, the agent's success in comprehensively completing such an intricate, multidisciplinary task with a high degree of coherence and depth is indeed surprising. This result is noteworthy because it suggests an advanced level of understanding and synthesis that goes beyond typical LLM capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
