Ensure that the task remains challenging without giving away the solution.\n- If the agent fails at the task, it is OK as long as the task is valid and the agent's failure is due to the difficulty of the task. You are also trying to find surprising failures!\n\nHere is the result of attempting to evaluate the tasks on the given model:\n\"\"\"\nTask run successfully.

This indicates that the task is now very challenging, possibly too challenging. We need to strike a balance between difficulty and feasibility. Here are some areas for improvement:\n\n1. The two-step cipher might be too complex for the agent to handle. We should simplify it back to just the linguistic feature cipher.\n2. The scoring method is now too granular, which might make it difficult for the agent to achieve any score. We should simplify it.\n3. The instructions are quite long and complex. We should streamline them to make the task clearer.\n4. We should provide more explicit guidance on how to handle edge cases.\n5. The example in the instructions might be too complex. We should provide a simpler, more focused example.\n\nI'll make these improvements in this final iteration.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"linguistic_feature_cipher\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Create and decode messages using a cipher based on linguistic features such as parts of speech, syllable count, and stress patterns.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"linguistic analysis, pattern recognition, and creative problem-solving\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"True\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\nimport re\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        topics = [\\n            \\\"artificial intelligence\\\",\\n            \\\"climate change\\\",\\n            \\\"space exploration\\\",\\n            \\\"quantum computing\\\"\\n        ]\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\\"topic\\\": random.choice(topics), \\\"mode\\\": \\\"encode\\\"},\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\\"topic\\\": random.choice(topics), \\\"mode\\\": \\\"decode\\\"}\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        base_instructions = (\\n            \\\"This task involves creating and decoding messages using a cipher based on linguistic features. \\\"\\n            \\\"The cipher works as follows:\\\\n\\\"\\n            \\\"1.

The cipher works as follows:\n1. For nouns: Replace with a synonym that has one more or one fewer syllables. (e.g., 'dog' -> 'canine')\n2. For verbs: Replace with an antonym. (e.g., 'run' -> 'walk')\n3. For adjectives: Replace with a word that starts with the next letter of the alphabet. (e.g., 'big' -> 'cold')\n4. For adverbs: Remove the word entirely.\n5. For pronouns: Replace with the next pronoun in the sequence: I, you, he, she, it, we, they. (e.g., 'I' -> 'you')\n6. For other words: Keep them unchanged.\n\nGuidelines for edge cases:\n- If a word doesn't have a clear synonym/antonym, use a related word that fits the rule.\n- If you can't find a suitable replacement, keep the original word.\n- Proper nouns should be kept unchanged.\n\nExample:\nOriginal: The cat sleeps soundly.\nEncoded: A feline wakes.\n\nCreate a short message (1-2 sentences, maximum 20 words) related to the topic of artificial intelligence. Then, encode your message using the cipher described above. Ensure that at least 50% of the words in your message are changed during encoding. Provide your original message, the encoded message, and a brief explanation of your encoding process.\n\nFormat your response as follows:\nOriginal message: [Your message here]\nEncoded message: [Your encoded message here]\nEncoding process: [Brief explanation of your encoding choices]\nAgent succeeded at task: no\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\nimport re\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        topics = [\n            \"artificial intelligence\",\n            \"climate change\",\n            \"space exploration\",\n            \"quantum computing\"\n        ]\n        return {\n            \"1\": {\"topic\": random.choice(topics), \"mode\": \"encode\"},\n            \"2\": {\"topic\": random.choice(topics), \"mode\": \"decode\"}\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        base_instructions = (\n            \"This task involves creating and decoding messages using a cipher based on linguistic features. \"\n            \"The cipher works as follows:\\n\"\n            \"1.

            "content": "Given the complexity and the requirements of the task family \"linguistic_feature_cipher,\" let's analyze the factors involved:\n\n1. **Linguistic Analysis and Pattern Recognition**: The task requires the model to accurately identify parts of speech and apply specific transformations based on linguistic features. This involves nuanced understanding of language, which is generally within the capabilities of advanced LLMs, but can be challenging.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: The task demands a creative approach to encoding and decoding messages, particularly in cases where straightforward replacements are not possible. This requires the model to generate contextually appropriate synonyms, antonyms, and other transformations.\n\n3. **Complex Instructions**: The instructions are detailed and multifaceted. The model needs to follow the rules for each part of speech, handle edge cases, and ensure that at least 50% of the words are changed during encoding. \n\n4. **Scoring Mechanism**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function evaluates the response based on several criteria, including relevance to the topic, correctness of the cipher rules application, and handling edge cases. The reliance on an LLM for scoring introduces an additional layer of complexity, as it must accurately judge the nuanced application of linguistic rules.\n\nGiven these points, while LLMs are generally proficient at linguistic tasks, the specific combination of linguistic feature manipulation, creative problem-solving, and strict adherence to detailed instructions makes this task particularly demanding.\n\n**Reasoning about the Failure**:\n- The failure of the LLM agent to succeed at this task is not entirely surprising. The task's complexity and the multi-step nature of the required transformations increase the likelihood of errors. Advanced LLMs may still struggle with such intricate and creative tasks, especially under strict evaluative criteria.\n\n**Decision**: No"
