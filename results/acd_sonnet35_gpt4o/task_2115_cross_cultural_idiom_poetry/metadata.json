To diversify our task set and explore a different aspect of language model capabilities, I'd like to propose a task family that combines artistic creativity, cultural understanding, and linguistic analysis. This task will challenge the model's ability to generate and analyze creative content while considering complex cultural and linguistic factors.\n\nThe task family I'm proposing is called \"cross_cultural_idiom_poetry\". It will require the model to create poetry using idioms from different cultures, analyze the cultural significance of these idioms, and explore how they can be creatively combined to convey new meanings. This task will measure the model's linguistic creativity, cultural knowledge, and ability to synthesize information across languages and cultures.\n\nI believe this task will be challenging for the model, as it requires not only knowledge of various idioms and their cultural contexts but also the ability to use them creatively in poetry while maintaining coherence and meaning. It will be interesting to see how the model handles the nuances of idiomatic expressions and their translation across cultural boundaries.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"cross_cultural_idiom_poetry\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Create and analyze poetry that incorporates idioms from different cultures, exploring their meanings and cultural significance.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"linguistic creativity, cultural knowledge, and cross-cultural synthesis\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        cultures = ['Chinese', 'Russian', 'Arabic', 'Spanish']\\n        tasks = [\\n            {\\n                'culture1': random.choice(cultures),\\n                'culture2': random.choice([c for c in cultures if c != cultures[0]])\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'culture1': random.choice(cultures),\\n                'culture2': random.choice([c for c in cultures if c != cultures[2]])\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        return {str(i+1): task for i, task in enumerate(tasks)}\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Create a poem that incorporates idioms from {t['culture1']} and {t['culture2']} cultures, and then analyze its cultural significance.

Idiom Explanations\n- **Russian Idiom 1: \"\u0421\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0445\" (To sit on two chairs)**  \n  Meaning: To attempt to do two contradictory things at the same time.  \n  Origin: This idiom implies the difficulty and instability of trying to balance two opposing situations or commitments.\n\n- **Russian Idiom 2: \"\u0412\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0430\u043f\u0448\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0448\u0438\" (To hang noodles on one's ears)**  \n  Meaning: To deceive or tell lies to someone.  \n  Origin: This phrase humorously describes the act of feeding someone falsehoods, likened to the absurdity of hanging noodles on their ears.\n\n- **English Idiom 1: \"Burning the midnight oil\"**  \n  Meaning: To work late into the night.  \n  Origin: From the time when oil lamps were used for light, this idiom highlights the dedication and effort of working late hours.\n\n- **English Idiom 2: \"The ball is in your court\"**  \n  Meaning: It is up to you to make the next decision or take action.  \n  Origin: This idiom comes from tennis, where the ball must be returned by the player whose court it lands in, indicating responsibility and action.\n\n2. Poem\nIn the quiet hours, burning the midnight oil,\nHe sat on two chairs, a life in turmoil.\nWith tales of grandeur, he did unfold,\nHanging noodles on ears, stories bold.\n\nThe ball in his court, the choice so clear,\nYet he lingered in shadows, driven by fear.\nBetween two worlds, he did reside,\nA heart divided, no place to hide.\n\nIn the silence, he found his voice,\nTo leave behind the deceit, to make a choice.\nNo longer swayed by tales untrue,\nHe stood his ground, a path anew.\n\n3. Analysis\na) The idioms were integrated to reflect a narrative of struggle and decision-making. \"Burning the midnight oil\" sets the scene of late-night introspection. \"To sit on two chairs\" portrays the protagonist's internal conflict of balancing contradictory lives. \"Hanging noodles on one's ears\" illustrates the deceit he indulges in or faces. Finally, \"The ball is in your court\" underscores the moment of decision and responsibility.\n\nb) One challenge was ensuring the idioms from different cultures blended seamlessly into a coherent narrative. Russian idioms often carry a humorous or metaphorical weight, while English idioms can be more straightforward. Balancing these tones while maintaining the poem's theme was challenging.\n\nc) The juxtaposition of these idioms enriches the poem by highlighting universal themes of struggle, deceit, and decision-making across cultures. It illustrates how different cultural expressions can convey similar human experiences, offering new perspectives on common life challenges.\n\n4. Cultural Reflection\na) The poem reflects the Russian value of wit and metaphor in expressing life's complexities and the English emphasis on diligence and responsibility. It comments on how individuals from different cultures face similar challenges, such as deceit and the need for decisive action.\n\nb) Potential misunderstandings could arise from the literal interpretation of idioms unfamiliar to the reader. For example, \"hanging noodles on one's ears\" might be confusing without cultural context. These idioms need careful explanation to fully grasp their metaphorical meanings.\n\nc) This exercise in cross-cultural poetry fosters intercultural understanding by demonstrating how idioms, despite their cultural specificity, can convey universal human experiences. It encourages readers to appreciate the richness of different languages and the shared human emotions and situations they describe.",
            "1. Idiom Explanations\n\n1.1. Russian Idiom: \"\u0412\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0430\u043f\u0448\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0448\u0438\" (Veshat' lapshu na ushi)\nMeaning: \"To hang noodles on someone\u2019s ears\" - to deceive or fool someone.\nOrigin: This idiom likely comes from the idea of something light and trivial being used to cover up or disguise the truth.\n\n1.2. Russian Idiom: \"\u0417\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438\" (Za sem'yu pechatyami)\nMeaning: \"Under seven seals\" - something highly secret or mysterious.\nOrigin: The phrase references ancient practices of sealing important documents with multiple seals to ensure their secrecy and protection.\n\n1.3. [Your second culture] Idiom: \"Break the ice\"\nMeaning: To initiate conversation in a social setting, especially to ease tension.\nOrigin: The phrase comes from the practice of breaking ice to allow ships to pass through frozen waters, symbolizing the clearing of barriers to communication.\n\n1.4. [Your second culture] Idiom: \"Bite the bullet\"\nMeaning: To face a difficult situation with courage and determination.\nOrigin: This idiom originates from the practice of having soldiers bite on a bullet during surgery to endure pain before the advent of anesthesia.\n\n2. Poem\n\nUnder seven seals, the secrets lie,\nIn shadows deep, where truths reside.\nA whispered word, to break the ice,\nIn twilight\u2019s glow, where fears subside.\n\nTo hang noodles on the ears they try,\nYet courage calls, we bite the bullet high.\nIn tangled webs of truth and lies,\nWe find our strength where darkness dies.\n\nA bridge of words, from heart to heart,\nAcross the seas, where cultures part.\nIn shared embrace, our spirits rise,\nThrough idioms\u2019 dance, we realize.\n\n3. Analysis\n\na) The idioms were integrated into the poem by weaving them into a narrative of uncovering truths and facing challenges. \"Under seven seals\" and \"hang noodles on the ears\" were used to set up the themes of secrecy and deception. \"Break the ice\" and \"bite the bullet\" were used to depict overcoming these challenges through communication and courage.\n\nb) Combining idioms from different cultures posed challenges in maintaining a coherent narrative and ensuring that the transitions between idioms felt natural. The key was to find a common theme that could link these idioms together, which in this case was the journey from secrecy and deception to understanding and courage.\n\nc) The juxtaposition of these idioms creates a layered narrative that explores the interplay between hidden truths and the bravery needed to confront them. It highlights the universal nature of these experiences, despite the cultural differences in how they are expressed. This blending of idioms offers fresh perspectives on familiar concepts, enriching the poem's thematic depth.\n\n4. Cultural Reflection\n\na) The poem reflects the cultural values of both chosen cultures by highlighting the importance of truth, communication, and courage. Russian culture\u2019s emphasis on the importance of secrecy and the potential for deception is balanced by the other culture\u2019s focus on breaking barriers and facing challenges head-on. This fusion underscores the universality of these themes.\n\nb) Potential misunderstandings might arise from the literal translation of idioms, as their figurative meanings might not be immediately clear to those unfamiliar with the cultural contexts. The idiomatic expressions could be misinterpreted if taken at face value, losing their intended nuance.\n\nc) This exercise in cross-cultural poetry fosters intercultural understanding by demonstrating how different cultures express similar human experiences through their unique idioms. It encourages readers to look beyond surface-level differences and appreciate the deeper connections that unite us all. By blending idioms from different cultures, the poem serves as a bridge, promoting empathy and shared understanding.",

Idiom Explanations\n- Russian Idiom: \"\u0421\u0435\u043c\u044c \u043f\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\" (Seven Fridays a week) \u2013 This means someone is very indecisive or constantly changes their plans. It originates from the idea that Fridays are often seen as the day plans and promises are made.\n- Russian Idiom: \"\u0412\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0441\" (To lead by the nose) \u2013 This means to deceive or mislead someone. It stems from the practice of leading animals by a rope attached to a ring in their nose, metaphorically implying control and manipulation.\n- English Idiom: \"Bite the bullet\" \u2013 This means to face a painful situation with courage. It originates from the practice of having soldiers bite on a bullet during surgery without anesthesia.\n- English Idiom: \"The ball is in your court\" \u2013 This means it is someone\u2019s turn to take action or make a decision. It comes from tennis, where the ball being in one\u2019s court signifies it\u2019s their turn to play.\n\n2. Poem\nIn a world where seven Fridays bloom,\nDecisions waver, plans consume,\nTo lead by the nose, a game we play,\nIn shadows of deceit, truth fades away.\n\nBite the bullet, face the storm,\nBravery in its truest form,\nThe ball is in your court, my friend,\nA choice to make, a path to mend.\n\nThrough cultures vast, our stories weave,\nIn idioms, our souls believe,\nFrom Russia\u2019s tales to English lands,\nUnited by the words we understand.\n\n3. Analysis\na) I integrated the idioms into the poem by building a narrative around decision-making, deception, courage, and responsibility. The idioms are used to highlight key moments in the story: indecision (\"Seven Fridays a week\"), deception (\"lead by the nose\"), bravery (\"bite the bullet\"), and decision-making (\"the ball is in your court\").\nb) One challenge was ensuring the idioms from different cultures fit naturally into a single narrative. I had to carefully craft the poem so that the transition between idioms felt seamless and the overall theme remained coherent.\nc) The juxtaposition of these idioms creates new meanings by highlighting universal human experiences\u2014indecision, deceit, bravery, and responsibility\u2014through different cultural lenses. This blending illustrates how, despite cultural differences, there are common threads in the way we understand and express complex emotions and situations.\n\n4. Cultural Reflection\na) The poem reflects the cultural values of decisiveness, honesty, bravery, and responsibility. Russian culture often emphasizes the importance of reliability and truthfulness, as seen in the idioms about deception and indecision. English idioms, on the other hand, highlight facing challenges with courage and taking responsibility for one\u2019s actions.\nb) Potential misunderstandings might arise from the direct translation of idioms, as they may lose their nuanced meanings. For example, \"Seven Fridays a week\" might not be immediately understood by an English-speaking audience without explanation.\nc) This exercise fosters intercultural understanding by showing how different cultures express similar human experiences through idioms. It emphasizes the shared aspects of our humanity and the unique ways we articulate them, encouraging appreciation and deeper comprehension of diverse cultural expressions.",

The theme centers around facing challenges and deceit with courage and integrity. Each idiom is seamlessly incorporated into the lines to maintain the flow and cohesiveness of the poem.\n\nb) One challenge was ensuring that the idioms from different cultures did not clash in meaning or tone.

The poem thus highlights a shared appreciation for these values across cultures.\n\nb) Potential misunderstandings could arise from the literal translation of idioms, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with their metaphorical meanings. For instance, \"hanging noodles on someone's ears\" might be puzzling without context. However, in the poem, the context provided helps mitigate this risk by aligning the idioms with universally understood themes.\n\nc) This exercise in cross-cultural poetry contributes to intercultural understanding by demonstrating how idiomatic expressions, though unique to their cultures, can convey similar sentiments and values. By creatively blending these idioms, the poem fosters an appreciation for the richness of diverse linguistic traditions, promoting empathy and connection between cultures."

However, his downfall begins when he attempts to \"add feet to a snake,\" symbolizing his overreach and the ruinous addition of unnecessary details.\n   - The struggle of \"sitting between two chairs\" reflects his indecision and the risk of failure from trying to balance incompatible paths.\n   - Finally, being \"led by the nose\" illustrates how deception and manipulation further complicate his journey, leading to his realization and growth.\n\nb) **Challenges Faced:**\n   - One challenge was ensuring that the idioms, despite their cultural specificity, blended seamlessly into a cohesive narrative without losing their original meanings.\n   - Another challenge was maintaining the poem's flow and coherence while embedding the idioms naturally within the storyline.\n\nc) **Juxtaposition of Idioms:**\n   - The juxtaposition of these idioms highlights the universal themes of human excellence, folly, indecision, and deception. It creates a rich tapestry that shows how different cultures address similar human experiences and moral lessons.\n\n4. Cultural Reflection\n\na) **Cultural Values and Worldviews:**\n   - The poem reflects Chinese values of wisdom and excellence, as seen in the \"dragon among men,\" and the caution against unnecessary embellishments in \"adding feet to a snake.\"\n   - It also comments on Russian cultural insights into the dangers of indecision (\"sitting between two chairs\") and the susceptibility to manipulation (\"led by the nose\").\n   - Together, these idioms underscore a shared human value: the importance of wisdom, balance, and integrity.\n\nb) **Potential Misunderstandings:**\n   - Combining idioms from different cultures might lead to misinterpretations if readers are unfamiliar with the cultural contexts. For instance, the symbolic significance of a dragon in Chinese culture might not be immediately clear to those from other backgrounds.\n\nc) **Contribution to Intercultural Understanding:**\n   - This exercise fosters intercultural understanding by illustrating common human experiences through the lens of different cultural idioms. It encourages readers to appreciate the richness of cultural expressions and the universal lessons they convey, promoting empathy and cross-cultural dialogue.",
            "1. Idiom Explanations\n\n- Chinese Idiom: \"\u753b\u86c7\u6dfb\u8db3\" (hu\u00e0 sh\u00e9 ti\u0101n z\u00fa) \u2013 \"Drawing legs on a snake.\" This idiom means to ruin something by adding unnecessary details. It originates from a story where a man, after completing a perfect drawing of a snake, added legs and thus spoiled it.\n\n- Chinese Idiom: \"\u585e\u7fc1\u5931\u9a6c\" (s\u00e0i w\u0113ng sh\u012b m\u01ce) \u2013 \"The old man lost his horse.\" This idiom signifies that a loss may turn into a gain and vice versa, deriving from a tale of an old man who lost his horse, which later turned out to be a blessing.\n\n- Russian Idiom: \"\u0412\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0430\u043f\u0448\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0448\u0438\" (veshat' lapshu na ushi) \u2013 \"To hang noodles on someone's ears.\" This idiom means to deceive or tell lies, akin to pulling the wool over someone\u2019s eyes.\n\n- Russian Idiom: \"\u041d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\" (ne vse kotu maslenitsa) \u2013 \"Not every day is Pancake Week for the cat.\" It means that good times do not last forever, implying the need to be prepared for less favorable times.\n\n2. Poem\n\nBeneath the sky, the old man sighs,\nHis horse is gone, but wisdom lies.\nHe knows well, the snake with legs,\nA ruinous touch, a mind that begs.\n\nIn distant lands, the cat awaits,\nNo endless feast on golden plates.\nNoodles dangled, ears deceive,\nYet truth endures in hearts that grieve.\n\nFrom east to west, the tales entwine,\nIn shadows cast, in sun they shine.\nA dance of words, a bridge to span,\nThe shared dreams of every man.\n\n3. Analysis\n\na) The idioms were woven into the poem to create a narrative of life's perennial ups and downs. \"The old man lost his horse\" and \"Not every day is Pancake Week for the cat\" both emphasize the transient nature of fortune. These are juxtaposed with \"Drawing legs on a snake,\" highlighting the folly of unnecessary embellishments, and \"To hang noodles on someone's ears,\" underscoring the theme of deception.\n\nb) A significant challenge was maintaining a cohesive narrative while integrating idioms from distinct cultures with different linguistic structures and cultural connotations. Balancing these idioms to respect their origins while crafting a poem that reads smoothly in English required thoughtful selection of context and phrasing.\n\nc) The juxtaposition of these idioms offers a fresh perspective on universal themes such as wisdom, deception, and the transient nature of good fortune. It highlights how different cultures, through their idioms, address similar human experiences and emotions, fostering a deeper appreciation for shared human values.\n\n4. Cultural Reflection\n\na) The poem reflects the shared human experience of navigating life's vicissitudes, a theme prevalent in both Chinese and Russian cultures. The Chinese idioms offer insights into wisdom through restraint and the natural ebb and flow of fortune, while the Russian idioms emphasize the impermanence of good times and the prevalence of deception.\n\nb) Potential misunderstandings could arise from readers unfamiliar with the cultural contexts of the idioms, leading to misinterpretations of their deeper meanings. For instance, \"Drawing legs on a snake\" might be misunderstood as merely artistic folly rather than a broader caution against unnecessary actions.\n\nc) This cross-cultural poetic exercise fosters intercultural understanding by illustrating common human experiences through the lens of different cultures. It underscores the idea that despite linguistic and cultural differences, there are universal truths and wisdoms that resonate across humanity, thereby promoting empathy and global interconnectedness."

            "content": "Given the task family \"cross_cultural_idiom_poetry,\" the capabilities being measured include linguistic creativity, cultural knowledge, and cross-cultural synthesis. The task is described as difficult for humans, which suggests a high level of complexity.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Linguistic Creativity:**\n   - LLMs are known for their ability to generate creative text, including poetry. However, the creativity required here is not just in generating text but in weaving together idioms from different cultures into a coherent poem.\n\n2. **Cultural Knowledge:**\n   - LLMs have been trained on vast corpora that include a wide variety of cultural content. Hence, they are likely to have access to idiomatic expressions from multiple cultures.\n   - However, understanding the nuances and origins of idioms, and correctly applying them in a culturally sensitive manner, is more challenging.\n\n3. **Cross-Cultural Synthesis:**\n   - Combining idioms from different cultures in a meaningful way requires a deep understanding of both cultures. This goes beyond mere translation and involves a synthesis of cultural contexts and values.\n   - The analysis and cultural reflection parts of the task require the LLM to demonstrate a nuanced understanding of cultural values and potential misinterpretations.\n\n### Evaluation Considerations:\n\n- **LLM Judge Suitability:**\n  - The evaluation involves subjective criteria such as creativity and cultural sensitivity, which could be challenging for an automated LLM judge to assess accurately.\n  - Despite this, the criteria are well-defined, which may help in achieving a consistent evaluation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the complexity of the task and the high level of cultural and linguistic understanding required, the LLM agent's success in this task is indeed noteworthy and surprising. It indicates that the LLM can not only generate creative text but also navigate the intricate cultural nuances involved in idiomatic expressions from different cultures.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
