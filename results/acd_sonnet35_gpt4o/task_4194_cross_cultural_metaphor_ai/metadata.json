            "**1. AI System Architecture**\n\n**a) Key Components**\n\nThe AI system for metaphor generation and interpretation consists of several key components: a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine, a cultural knowledge base, a metaphor database, a machine learning model, and an evaluation module. The NLP engine processes input texts to identify and analyze metaphors. The cultural knowledge base stores information about cultural norms, values, and linguistic patterns. The metaphor database provides examples of metaphors across different cultures. The machine learning model, which includes neural networks and transformer models such as GPT-4, generates new metaphors. Lastly, the evaluation module assesses the appropriateness and cultural authenticity of the generated metaphors.\n\n**b) Incorporating Cultural Knowledge and Linguistic Patterns**\n\nThe system incorporates cultural knowledge through a combination of curated databases and automated learning from large-scale text corpora. It uses cultural informants and experts to enrich the knowledge base with contextually relevant information. Linguistic patterns are learned using NLP techniques, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic analysis, which help the system understand and generate language specific to different cultures.\n\n**c) Data Sources and Knowledge Bases**\n\nThe primary data sources include ethnographic studies, literary texts, folklore, proverbs, and contemporary media from various cultures. The knowledge base is built using a combination of structured databases, such as Ethnologue and World Bank cultural datasets, and unstructured text corpora from sources like news articles, books, and social media. This ensures a rich and diverse understanding of different cultural contexts.\n\n**d) Novel Machine Learning Models or Algorithms**\n\nThe system employs state-of-the-art transformer models, such as GPT-4, for language generation and BERT for understanding context. These models are fine-tuned on culturally specific corpora to enhance their sensitivity to cultural nuances. Additionally, a novel algorithm is used for metaphor extraction, combining rule-based and machine learning approaches to accurately identify and interpret metaphors in text.\n\n**2. Cross-Cultural Metaphor Analysis**\n\n**a) Analyzing Metaphors in Nigerian Culture**\n\nThe AI system analyzes existing metaphors for success in Nigerian culture by first collecting a comprehensive dataset of Nigerian texts, including literature, proverbs, and contemporary media. The NLP engine processes these texts to identify metaphorical expressions related to success. By applying semantic analysis, the system determines the underlying concepts and cultural values these metaphors represent.\n\n**b) Extracting Cultural Nuances and Conceptual Mappings**\n\nThe system uses a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches to extract cultural nuances. It identifies common themes and values associated with success in Nigerian culture, such as community achievement, resilience, and overcoming adversity. Conceptual mappings are created by linking these themes to metaphorical expressions, providing a structured understanding of how success is conceptualized.\n\n**c) Comparing Metaphors Across Cultures**\n\nTo compare Nigerian metaphors with those from other cultures, the system uses its metaphor database, which contains a wide range of metaphors from diverse cultural contexts. It employs clustering algorithms to group similar metaphors and identify unique cultural features. This comparative analysis helps to highlight both common and distinct conceptualizations of success across cultures.\n\n**3. Metaphor Generation Process**\n\n**a) Step-by-Step Generation Process**\n\n1. **Input Processing**: The user inputs the concept and cultural context (e.g., success in Nigerian culture).\n2. **Data Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant cultural and metaphorical data from the knowledge base.\n3. **Conceptual Mapping**: It identifies key cultural themes and values related to the concept.\n4. **Metaphor Generation**: Using the fine-tuned GPT-4 model, the system generates candidate metaphors by combining cultural themes with linguistic patterns.\n5. **Evaluation**: The generated metaphors are evaluated for cultural appropriateness and coherence using the evaluation module.\n6. **Output**: The best metaphors are presented to the user.\n\n**b) Ensuring Cultural Appropriateness and Linguistic Coherence**\n\nCultural appropriateness is ensured through continuous input from cultural experts and feedback loops. The evaluation module includes a scoring system that assesses metaphors based on cultural relevance, linguistic accuracy, and contextual fit. Additionally, the system uses cultural informants to validate the outputs.\n\n**c) Creativity-Enhancing Mechanisms**\n\nThe system incorporates mechanisms such as novelty detection algorithms and creative constraints to enhance metaphor generation. Novelty detection ensures that new metaphors are unique and not mere repetitions of existing ones. Creative constraints guide the generation process by imposing specific cultural and linguistic rules, fostering innovative yet culturally grounded metaphors.\n\n**4. Generated Metaphors**\n\n**Metaphor 1: \"Success is a well-tended yam farm.\"**\n- **Meaning**: Success is the result of hard work, care, and consistent effort.\n- **Cultural Elements**: Yam farming is a significant aspect of Nigerian agriculture and symbolizes prosperity and diligence.\n- **Differences from Other Cultures**: Unlike Western metaphors that may equate success with rapid growth (e.g., \"a rocket\"), this metaphor emphasizes steady and sustained effort.\n\n**Metaphor 2: \"Success is climbing the iroko tree.\"**\n- **Meaning**: Achieving success requires overcoming significant challenges and reaching great heights.\n- **Cultural Elements**: The iroko tree is a tall and strong tree native to Nigeria, symbolizing strength and ambition.\n- **Differences from Other Cultures**: Western metaphors might use skyscrapers or ladders, while this metaphor is deeply rooted in the local natural landscape.\n\n**Metaphor 3: \"Success is weaving a colorful aso-oke.\"**\n- **Meaning**: Success is a skillful and creative process that results in something beautiful and valuable.\n- **Cultural Elements**: Aso-oke is a traditional Yoruba fabric, representing cultural heritage and craftsmanship.\n- **Differences from Other Cultures**: This metaphor highlights artistic creation, contrasting with metaphors from industrialized cultures that may focus on production or competition.\n\n**5. Evaluation and Limitations**\n\n**a) Evaluation Methods**\n\nThe evaluation of cultural authenticity and effectiveness involves both qualitative and quantitative methods. User feedback and expert reviews provide qualitative insights, while sentiment analysis and user engagement metrics offer quantitative data. The system also employs A/B testing to compare different metaphor outputs and refine its algorithms based on performance.\n\n**b) Potential Limitations or Biases**\n\nOne limitation is the potential for cultural bias in the training data, which may affect the system's ability to generate accurate metaphors for less-represented cultures. Additionally, the system might struggle with the dynamic nature of cultural values, leading to outdated or irrelevant metaphors. Bias in the input data or the interpretation algorithms could also skew the results.\n\n**c) Areas for Future Improvement**\n\nFuture improvements could include expanding the cultural knowledge base to cover more diverse cultures and continuously updating it with current data. Enhancing the system's adaptability to evolving cultural contexts and integrating more sophisticated sentiment analysis tools would also improve metaphor generation. Collaborating with cultural experts for regular updates and validations can further refine the system's accuracy.\n\n**6. Ethical and Cultural Considerations**\n\n**a) Ethical Implications**\n\nUsing AI to generate culturally-specific metaphors raises ethical concerns about authenticity and respect for cultural heritage. It is crucial to ensure that the metaphors generated are not only accurate but also respectful and representative of the culture in question.\n\n**b) Cultural Appropriation and Misrepresentation**\n\nThere is a risk of cultural appropriation or misrepresentation if the AI system generates metaphors without a deep understanding of the cultural context. To mitigate this, the system must be designed with input from cultural experts and continuously validated against authentic cultural sources.\n\n**c) Guidelines for Responsible Development**\n\nResponsible development of cross-cultural AI systems should include transparency in the data sources and algorithms used, regular consultation with cultural informants, and mechanisms for users to provide feedback and corrections. It is also essential to prioritize ethical considerations, such as cultural sensitivity and respect for intellectual property, in the design and deployment of the system.\n\n**Answer:**\n**1.

Use appropriate terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts. Be creative and culturally sensitive in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1350-1650 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of metaphor theory and cultural nuances.\",\n            \"The AI system design is innovative and plausibly incorporates cultural knowledge and linguistic patterns.\",\n            \"The generated metaphors are creative, culturally appropriate, and coherent.\",\n            \"The analysis includes thoughtful consideration of ethical implications and cultural sensitivity.\",\n            \"The response addresses all required sections with appropriate depth and clarity.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complexity of the task, which involves deep interdisciplinary knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and advanced AI system design, it is indeed a very challenging task for an LLM. \n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: The task requires a deep understanding of metaphor theory, cultural anthropology, and AI system design. This is a high bar even for advanced LLMs, as it demands not only linguistic capabilities but also sophisticated conceptual and cultural understanding.\n\n2. **Cultural Understanding and Linguistic Creativity**: Generating metaphors that are culturally appropriate and linguistically coherent across different cultures is a non-trivial task. It involves nuanced understanding of cultural contexts and the ability to create new, meaningful expressions.\n\n3. **AI System Design**: Designing an AI system, detailing its architecture, incorporating cultural knowledge bases, and employing novel machine learning models requires a high level of technical sophistication.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the task. While LLMs can be good at assessing language and coherence, evaluating the cultural appropriateness and the innovative aspects of AI system design might be challenging for an LLM judge.\n\nGiven these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would be surprising and noteworthy due to the depth and breadth of expertise required and the complexity of the task.\n\nDecision: Yes"
