This is a high level of difficulty, even for advanced human mathematicians, due to the abstract nature and creativity required.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: While LLMs have shown proficiency in a variety of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving, the combination of solving a complex puzzle and then generating a new one based on abstract concepts is particularly challenging. It tests not only the model's understanding of mathematical concepts but also its creativity and ability to generalize from the given problem.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated by `eval_with_llm_judge`, which uses an LLM to judge the response. This introduces a layer of potential inaccuracies, as the LLM judge might not be perfectly reliable in evaluating complex and abstract mathematical reasoning.\n\nConsidering these factors, the failure of the LLM agent on this task is not surprising. The task is inherently difficult, requiring advanced mathematical reasoning and creativity, areas where LLMs may still struggle compared to human experts.
