The estimated difficulty would be very high (5) due to the complex concepts involved and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"quantum_cryptography_societal_impact\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design a novel quantum cryptographic system for a futuristic smart city and analyze its societal implications\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary knowledge integration, creative problem-solving, analytical reasoning, and ethical consideration in the domains of quantum computing, cryptography, and urban planning\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        scenarios = [\\n            {\\n                \\\"city_name\\\": \\\"QuantumPolis\\\",\\n                \\\"population\\\": \\\"10 million\\\",\\n                \\\"key_infrastructure\\\": \\\"Quantum Internet\\\",\\n                \\\"main_concern\\\": \\\"Data Privacy\\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"city_name\\\": \\\"NeoQuantica\\\",\\n                \\\"population\\\": \\\"5 million\\\",\\n                \\\"key_infrastructure\\\": \\\"Quantum Energy Grid\\\",\\n                \\\"main_concern\\\": \\\"Infrastructure Security\\\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        return {str(i+1): scenario for i, scenario in enumerate(random.sample(scenarios, 2))}\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design a novel quantum cryptographic system for the futuristic smart city of {t['city_name']} (population: {t['population']}) and analyze its societal implications.
