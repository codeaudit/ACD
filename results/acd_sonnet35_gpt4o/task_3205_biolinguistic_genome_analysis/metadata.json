            "1. Conceptual Framework (300-350 words):\n\na) To integrate syntactic trees, gene expression regulation, and mutual information into a biolinguistic framework, we start by treating genomic sequences as structured linguistic entities. Syntactic trees, which represent hierarchical relationships in sentences, can analogously represent the structural organization of genetic elements. The biological process of gene expression regulation can be mapped to the functional interpretation of these structures, akin to how syntax influences meaning in language. Mutual information, a measure of the dependency between variables, helps quantify the information shared between genetic elements and their regulatory outcomes.\n\nb) The key components of this biolinguistic framework are:\n   - Genomic Syntactic Trees (GSTs): These trees represent the hierarchical organization of genes, promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory elements.\n   - Regulatory Syntax Rules: Analogous to grammatical rules, these dictate how genetic elements interact to regulate gene expression.\n   - Mutual Information Matrix (MIM): This matrix quantifies the mutual information between different parts of the genomic sequence, indicating how changes in one part can affect others.\n\nThese components interact as follows: GSTs provide the structural backbone, Regulatory Syntax Rules define the functional relationships, and the MIM quantifies the information flow within the structure.\n\nc) Traditional genomic analysis often focuses on linear sequences and statistical correlations. Our approach differs by emphasizing hierarchical structure and information flow, akin to understanding sentences rather than just word frequencies. This allows for a more nuanced analysis of how genetic elements interact and regulate gene expression.\n\n2. Methodology (250-300 words):\n\na) Steps to apply the framework:\n   1. Convert the genomic sequence into a GST using predefined rules for identifying genes, promoters, and regulatory elements.\n   2. Apply Regulatory Syntax Rules to interpret the GST, identifying potential regulatory interactions.\n   3. Calculate the MIM to quantify the information flow between different parts of the sequence.\n   4. Integrate these insights to predict gene expression outcomes and regulatory dynamics.\n\nb) Genetic information is represented as nodes and branches in the GST. Nodes represent genetic elements (e.g., genes, promoters), while branches indicate regulatory relationships. The sequence is processed by parsing it into this tree structure, applying syntax rules to define interactions, and using mutual information to quantify dependencies.\n\nc) Novel algorithms/data structures:\n   - GST Construction Algorithm: Parses sequences into hierarchical trees.\n   - Regulatory Syntax Parser: Applies grammatical rules to define interactions.\n   - MIM Calculator: Computes mutual information between nodes.\n\n3. Application Example (250-300 words):\n\na) Analyzing sequence: ATCG GTTA CCTA GGAC TAAT CGGA\n\nb) Analysis process:\n   1. Convert sequence into GST:\n       Root\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 ATCG\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 GTTA\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 CCTA\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 GGAC\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 TAAT\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 CGGA\n\n   2. Apply syntax rules to identify interactions:\n       Root\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 Gene (ATCG)\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Promoter (GTTA)\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 Enhancer (CCTA)\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Gene (GGAC)\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 Promoter (TAAT)\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Enhancer (CGGA)\n\n   3. Calculate MIM to quantify information flow:\n       MIM shows high mutual information between GTTA-ATCG and TAAT-GGAC, indicating strong regulatory interactions.\n\nc) Insights:\n   - GTTA likely regulates ATCG gene expression.\n   - TAAT likely regulates GGAC gene expression.\n   - Enhancers CCTA and CGGA may have additional regulatory roles.\n\nd) Visual representation:\n   ```\n       Root\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 ATCG\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 GTTA\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 CCTA\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 GGAC\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 TAAT\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 CGGA\n   ```\n\n4. Comparative Analysis (200-250 words):\n\na) Traditional genomic methods often rely on linear sequence analysis and correlation-based methods. Our framework, using GSTs and syntax rules, introduces a hierarchical and structural perspective.\n\nb) Advantages:\n   - Captures complex regulatory interactions.\n   - Provides a holistic view of gene regulation.\n   - More predictive of functional outcomes.\n\n   Limitations:\n   - Requires extensive annotation of genomic elements.\n   - Computationally intensive due to tree construction and mutual information calculation.\n\nc) Our framework challenges the linear paradigm, emphasizing structure and information flow, which can complement existing methods by providing deeper insights into gene regulation mechanisms.\n\n5. Implications and Future Directions (200-250 words):\n\na) The biolinguistic framework bridges genetics and linguistics, offering a novel perspective on genomic analysis.

Syntactic trees, which represent hierarchical relationships in sentences, can analogously represent the structural organization of genetic elements. The biological process of gene expression regulation can be mapped to the functional interpretation of these structures, akin to how syntax influences meaning in language. Mutual information, a measure of the dependency between variables, helps quantify the information shared between genetic elements and their regulatory outcomes.\n\nb) The key components of this biolinguistic framework are:\n   - Genomic Syntactic Trees (GSTs): These trees represent the hierarchical organization of genes, promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory elements.\n   - Regulatory Syntax Rules: Analogous to grammatical rules, these dictate how genetic elements interact to regulate gene expression.\n   - Mutual Information Matrix (MIM): This matrix quantifies the mutual information between different parts of the genomic sequence, indicating how changes in one part can affect others.\n\nThese components interact as follows: GSTs provide the structural backbone, Regulatory Syntax Rules define the functional relationships, and the MIM quantifies the information flow within the structure.\n\nc) Traditional genomic analysis often focuses on linear sequences and statistical correlations.

Use appropriate technical terminology from all relevant fields and provide clear explanations for complex concepts.\n\nYour total response should be between 1200-1450 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the given linguistic concept, biological process, and information theory principle.\",\n            \"The biolinguistic framework is innovative and integrates concepts from multiple disciplines coherently.\",\n            \"The methodology is clearly explained and scientifically plausible.\",\n            \"The application example effectively analyzes the given genomic sequence using the proposed framework.\",\n            \"The response includes an ASCII art representation of the framework's interpretation of the sequence.\",\n            \"The comparative analysis shows critical thinking and awareness of existing methods.\",\n            \"The implications and future directions are insightful and demonstrate the broader potential of the framework.\",\n            \"The response is well-structured and adheres to the specified word count for each section.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task's complexity and interdisciplinary nature, let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**:\n   - The task requires integrating concepts from linguistics, genetics, and information theory. This is a high level of interdisciplinary knowledge, which is challenging even for human experts.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving and Abstract Reasoning**:\n   - Designing a novel framework that combines these diverse fields involves a significant degree of creativity and abstract reasoning. This is a complex cognitive task.\n\n3. **Technical Terminology and Plausibility**:\n   - The task demands the use of appropriate technical terminology and scientific plausibility across all sections. This requires the LLM to not only understand the concepts but also present them in a coherent and scientifically accurate manner.\n\n4. **Example and Comparative Analysis**:\n   - Applying the framework to a genomic sequence and then comparing it to existing methods in genomics and bioinformatics requires practical application skills and critical thinking.\n\n5. **Implications and Future Directions**:\n   - Discussing broader implications and proposing future research directions shows a forward-thinking approach, which is generally more challenging for LLMs.\n\nGiven these points, if an LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would indeed be surprising and noteworthy. This level of interdisciplinary integration, creative problem-solving, and detailed technical explanation is challenging and not typically expected of current LLM capabilities.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
