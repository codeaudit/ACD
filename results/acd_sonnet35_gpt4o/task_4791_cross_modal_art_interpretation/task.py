Visual Artwork: {t['visual_art']} by {t['artist']}
Target Medium: {t['target_medium']}

Your task is to:

1. Visual Analysis (200-250 words):
   a) Describe the key visual elements of the artwork.
   b) Analyze the composition, use of color, shapes, and space.
   c) Interpret the possible meanings or emotions conveyed by the visual elements.

2. Conceptual Interpretation (200-250 words):
   a) Identify the main themes or ideas expressed in the artwork.
   b) Explain how these themes relate to the artist's known style or philosophy.
   c) Discuss any historical or cultural context that informs your interpretation.

3. Cross-Modal Translation (250-300 words):
   Cross-modal translation involves expressing the essence of one art form in another medium.
   a) Translate the key elements and themes of the visual artwork into the specified target medium.
   b) Describe your translation conceptually, explaining how each element corresponds to the original.
   c) Justify your creative choices in the translation process.
   Note: Do not generate or describe actual images, music, or poetry. Focus on the conceptual translation.

4. Comparative Analysis (200-250 words):
   a) Compare and contrast the original visual artwork with your translated version.
   b) Analyze how the change in medium affects the expression of the core concepts.
   c) Discuss any new meanings or interpretations that emerge through the translation.

5. Reflection on Cross-Modal Creativity (150-200 words):
   a) Reflect on the challenges and insights gained from this cross-modal translation process.
   b) Discuss how this exercise relates to human cognition and creativity.
   c) Speculate on the implications for AI systems attempting similar tasks.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of both visual art and the target medium, as well as the ability to draw meaningful connections between different forms of artistic expression. Be creative and insightful in your interpretation and translation while maintaining logical consistency in your analysis.

Format your response with clear headings for each section as numbered above. Your total response should be between 1000-1250 words."""
