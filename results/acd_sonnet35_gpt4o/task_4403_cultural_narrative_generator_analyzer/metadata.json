Your response should include the following sections:\n\n1. System Architecture (250-300 words):\n   a) Describe the key components of your AI system for generating and analyzing culturally-specific narratives.\n   b) Explain how your system integrates computational linguistics, literary theory, and cultural anthropology.\n   c) Detail the process of narrative generation and analysis, focusing on cultural authenticity.\n   d) Propose a novel algorithm for incorporating the specified narrative element into the story structure.\n\n2. Cultural-Narrative Mapping (200-250 words):\n   a) Explain the significance of the Trickster archetype in Maori storytelling traditions.\n   b) Describe how your system translates cultural knowledge into narrative features and structures.\n   c) Discuss how variations in cultural parameters would result in different narrative outputs.\n\n3. Narrative Generation and Analysis (200-250 words):\n   a) Explain the process by which your AI system generates narratives based on the cultural-narrative mapping.\n   b) Describe how the system ensures cultural authenticity and narrative coherence.\n   c) Detail how the AI analyzes the generated narratives in terms of their cultural significance and literary merit.\n   d) Provide a brief example (100-150 words) of a narrative snippet generated by your system, demonstrating its cultural specificity and incorporation of the Trickster archetype.\n\n4. Linguistic and Stylistic Considerations (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss how your system incorporates Maori-specific linguistic features and literary devices.\n   b) Explain how the AI adapts its language model to capture the unique voice and style of Maori narratives.\n   c) Propose a method to evaluate the linguistic and stylistic authenticity of the generated narratives.\n\n5. Applications and Implications (150-200 words):\n   a) Suggest potential applications of your cultural narrative AI system in fields such as education, cultural preservation, or creative writing.\n   b) Discuss the implications of this technology for cross-cultural understanding and literary studies.\n   c) Propose an experiment to test the system's effectiveness in generating culturally authentic and engaging narratives.\n\n6. Ethical Considerations (100-150 words):\n   a) Identify potential ethical concerns related to AI-generated cultural narratives.\n   b) Discuss the implications of using AI to represent and potentially influence cultural storytelling traditions.\n   c) Propose guidelines for the responsible development and use of cultural narrative AI systems.\n   d) Briefly explain how your system would address potential cultural biases or misrepresentations.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of computational linguistics, literary theory, and cultural anthropology. Use appropriate terminology from all relevant fields and provide clear explanations where necessary. Be creative in your approach while maintaining cultural sensitivity and academic rigor.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section. Your total response should be between 1150-1500 words, including the example narrative snippet.

            "content": "Given the nature of the task family \"cultural_narrative_generator_analyzer,\" it is designed to measure complex skills including interdisciplinary knowledge integration, creative storytelling, cultural understanding, and analytical reasoning. The task requires the LLM to not only generate culturally-specific narratives but also to analyze them through the lens of computational linguistics, literary theory, and cultural anthropology.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: Integrating knowledge from computational linguistics, literary theory, and cultural anthropology is a high-level requirement that demands sophisticated understanding and synthesis of diverse academic fields.\n2. **Creative Storytelling**: Generating culturally-specific narratives, particularly with elements like the Trickster archetype, involves deep cultural insights and advanced narrative generation capabilities.\n3. **Cultural Understanding**: The task requires the LLM to have or simulate a nuanced understanding of specific cultural traditions, which is challenging given the diversity and depth of cultural knowledge.\n4. **Analytical Reasoning**: Analyzing the generated narratives for cultural authenticity, narrative coherence, and literary merit involves complex reasoning skills.\n\n### Human Difficulty:\nThe task is described as \"very difficult\" for humans, indicating that it requires significant expertise and effort even for knowledgeable individuals.\n\n### LLM Capabilities:\nWhile LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in generating text and responding to complex prompts, this task's interdisciplinary and culturally-sensitive requirements push the boundaries of typical LLM capabilities.\n\n### Evaluation:\nThe task is evaluated using an LLM judge via the `eval_with_llm_judge` function. Given the complexity and the need for sophisticated judgment on cultural and interdisciplinary integration, this method of evaluation might not capture the full depth of the requirements.\n\n### Decision:\nThe fact that the LLM agent succeeded at this task is surprising due to the intricate and multi-faceted nature of the task, which goes beyond simple text generation and involves deep cultural and academic understanding.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
