            "Puzzle: It's raining ______ and ______.\n\nSolution: \n1. The original idiom is \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"\n2. This idiom means that it is raining very heavily.\n3. The phrase \"cats and dogs\" is used metaphorically to imply a chaotic, heavy downpour, similar to how cats and dogs might create chaos if they were falling from the sky.\n4. Filling in the blanks with \"cats\" and \"dogs\" completes the idiom to convey the intended meaning of a heavy rainstorm.\n\nNew idiom: It's raining elephants and buffaloes.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The new idiom \"It's raining elephants and buffaloes\" captures the essence of the original idiom by using large, heavy animals to emphasize the intensity of the rain.\n2. Elephants and buffaloes are significant animals in many cultures, particularly in regions like Africa and India. These animals are known for their size and presence, which helps to convey the idea of a powerful and overwhelming downpour.\n3. By using imagery of elephants and buffaloes, the new idiom maintains the metaphorical representation of a heavy rainstorm while incorporating cultural elements from areas where these animals are prominent. This serves to create a vivid and relatable picture for those familiar with these creatures, making the idiom both effective and culturally relevant.",
            "Puzzle: It's raining _____ and _____.\n\nSolution: \n1. The original idiom is \"It's raining cats and dogs,\" which means it is raining very heavily.\n2. To solve the puzzle, identify the two missing words that complete the phrase: \"cats\" and \"dogs.\"\n3. Thus, the answer to the fill in the blank puzzle is \"cats\" and \"dogs.\"\n\nNew idiom: It's raining tigers and elephants.\n\nExplanation: \nThis new idiom captures the essence of heavy rain by using imagery from Indian culture, where tigers and elephants are iconic and significant animals. Just as the original idiom uses the unexpected and chaotic imagery of cats and dogs raining from the sky, the new idiom uses the powerful and grand imagery of tigers and elephants to convey the intensity and heaviness of the rain. In Indian culture, these animals are often associated with strength and majesty, which enhances the sense of a formidable downpour.",
            "Puzzle: It's raining ____ and ____.\n\nSolution:\n1. This idiom describes a situation where it is raining very heavily.\n2. The idiomatic expression is \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"\n3. The phrase is used to emphasize the intensity of the rainfall by comparing it to the unlikely event of cats and dogs falling from the sky.\n4. The missing words are \"cats\" and \"dogs.\"\nSo the complete idiom is: \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"\n\nNew idiom: It's raining elephants and buffaloes.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The original idiom \"It's raining cats and dogs\" uses common animals in Western culture to describe heavy rain.\n2. In many African cultures, elephants and buffaloes are significant and powerful animals.\n3. By using \"elephants and buffaloes,\" the new idiom captures the essence of heavy rain by referring to large, powerful animals that symbolize strength and presence in African culture.\n4. The imagery of elephants and buffaloes falling from the sky conveys an exaggerated and intense form of rainfall, much like the original idiom.\n\nTherefore, the new idiom \"It's raining elephants and buffaloes\" captures the original meaning of heavy rain while incorporating cultural elements from Africa.",
            "Puzzle: It's raining ___ and ___.\n\nSolution:\n1. The original idiom is \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"\n2. The meaning of this idiom is that it is raining very heavily.\n3. The words to fill in the blanks are \"cats\" and \"dogs.\"\n4. Hence, the completed idiom is \"It's raining cats and dogs.\"\n\nNew idiom: It's a monsoon of elephants and peacocks.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The new idiom uses imagery from Indian culture, where monsoons are a significant weather event known for heavy rains.\n2. Elephants and peacocks are iconic animals in Indian culture: elephants symbolize strength and grandeur, while peacocks symbolize beauty and are often associated with the rainy season.\n3. This new idiom captures the essence of the original by using culturally significant animals to convey the idea of very heavy rain.",
            "Puzzle: It's raining _____ and dogs.\n\nSolution:\n1. Identify the idiom: 'It's raining cats and dogs'.\n2. Determine the missing word: In this case, 'cats' is the missing word.\n3. Fill in the blank: The completed idiom is 'It's raining cats and dogs'.\n4. Explanation: This idiom is used to describe very heavy rainfall. The phrase is thought to originate from 17th-century England, where \"cats and dogs\" could refer to the noise made by the rain and wind, or it might refer to a time when street drainage systems were so poor that heavy rains could carry away debris, including dead animals.\n\nNew idiom: It's raining elephants and tigers.\n\nExplanation: This new idiom captures the essence of the original by using animals to describe heavy rain, but it draws from Indian culture, where elephants and tigers are significant and powerful animals. In India, the monsoon season brings very heavy and intense rainfall, and using large, powerful animals like elephants and tigers emphasizes the strength and intensity of the rain, much like the original idiom does with cats and dogs."

            "Puzzle: \ud83d\udc31\ud83e\udd32\ud83d\udd52\n\nSolution: \n1. The cat emoji (\ud83d\udc31) represents \"\u732b (neko),\" which means \"cat\" in Japanese.\n2. The hand emoji (\ud83e\udd32) represents \"\u624b (te),\" which means \"hand\" in Japanese.\n3. The clock emoji (\ud83d\udd52) indicating 3 o'clock can be interpreted as a symbol of time or urgency. \n\nPutting these elements together, we get \"cat's hand time,\" which points to the Japanese idiom \"\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044\" (neko no te mo karitai), meaning \"to be so busy that you'd even ask a cat for help.\"\n\nNew idiom: \"Borrowing the elephant's trunk\"\n\nExplanation: In many African cultures, elephants are seen as wise and strong creatures. The idiom \"Borrowing the elephant's trunk\" conveys the same urgency and busyness as the original Japanese idiom. The imagery of needing assistance from an elephant, a large and powerful animal, emphasizes the extent of the busyness, similar to how the Japanese idiom suggests asking even a cat for help. This idiom captures the essence of being overwhelmed and needing help from any available source, fitting well within the cultural context of valuing the strength and wisdom of elephants.",
            "Puzzle: \ud83d\udc31\u270b\ud83d\udd04\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSolution: \n1. The first emoji \ud83d\udc31 represents a \"cat\".\n2. The second emoji \u270b represents a \"hand\".\n3. The third emoji \ud83d\udd04 represents \"borrowing\" or \"asking for help\".\n4. The fourth emoji \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f represents \"running\" which symbolizes being busy.\n\nPutting these elements together, the rebus puzzle translates to \"Cat's hand borrow running\" or \"So busy that you would even ask for a cat\u2019s hand to help,\" which is a direct reference to the Japanese idiom '\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044' meaning to be extremely busy.\n\nNew idiom: \"Even the camel's hump is needed.\"\n\nExplanation: \nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, camels are essential animals, especially in desert regions. They are known for their ability to carry heavy loads and travel long distances without water. The hump of the camel is a distinctive feature that stores fat, which the camel uses to survive in harsh conditions. \n\nThis new idiom, \"Even the camel's hump is needed,\" captures the essence of being so busy that every possible resource, even those not typically used or considered, is necessary. It conveys the idea of extreme busyness and the need for all hands on deck, similar to the original Japanese idiom. The imagery relates to the Middle Eastern culture where camels are a symbol of endurance and survival.",
            "Puzzle: \ud83d\udc31\u270b\ud83d\udd04\ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udcbc\n\nSolution: \n1. The first emoji \ud83d\udc31 represents a \"cat.\"\n2.

The fourth emoji \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f represents \"running\" or \"being in a hurry.\"\n5. The fifth emoji \ud83d\udcbc represents \"work\" or \"busy.\"\n\nPutting these together, we get \"Cat's hand, borrowing, busy,\" which translates to the Japanese idiom '\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044' (neko no te mo karitai), meaning \"to be so busy that you'd even borrow a cat's paw for help.\"\n\nNew idiom: \"Borrowing the dragon's tail\"\n\nExplanation: In Chinese culture, dragons are powerful and revered creatures. Saying \"borrowing the dragon's tail\" would imply seeking help from an incredibly powerful and busy being, emphasizing the extremity of one's busyness. This idiom captures the essence of desperately needing help, similar to the Japanese idiom, but uses the culturally significant imagery of a dragon from Chinese mythology.",

The first image is a cat (\ud83d\udc31), which represents \"\u732b\" (neko) in Japanese.\n2. The second image is a hand (\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f), representing \"\u624b\" (te) in Japanese.\n3. The plus sign (\u2795) indicates the combination of elements.\n4. The third image is a pair of hands (\ud83e\udd32), suggesting the idea of borrowing or needing help.\n5. The final image is a distressed face (\ud83d\ude29) and a clock (\u23f0), indicating being extremely busy or pressed for time.\n\nCombining these elements, we get: \n- \"\u732b\" (cat) \n- \"\u624b\" (hand) \n- needing help (\ud83e\udd32) \n- and being extremely busy (\ud83d\ude29\u23f0).\n\nThis illustrates the Japanese idiom '\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044' (neko no te mo karitai), which means \"to be so busy that you would even welcome the help of a cat.\"\n\nNew idiom: \"As busy as a camel in a desert bazaar.\"\n\nExplanation: \nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, camels are integral to daily life and commerce, especially in desert regions where bazaars (markets) are bustling hubs of activity. A camel in a desert bazaar would be extremely busy carrying goods, navigating the crowds, and performing various tasks. This imagery captures the essence of being extremely busy, similar to the Japanese idiom '\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044'.\n\nBy using the camel and bazaar imagery, the new idiom conveys a sense of overwhelming busyness and the need for additional help, drawing on the cultural context of Middle Eastern markets where activity is constant and intense.",

The hand emoji (\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f) represents \"\u624b\" (te), which means \"hand.\"\n3. The back arrow emoji (\ud83d\udd19) represents the concept of borrowing, as in \"\u501f\u308a\u308b\" (kariru), which means \"to borrow.\"\n4. The clock emoji (\u23f0) signifies the urgency or busyness, aligning with the context of time.\n\nPutting these elements together, we get \"\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044\" (neko no te mo karitai), which translates to \"Even want to borrow a cat's hand,\" meaning to be extremely busy.\n\nNew idiom: \"Even the camel's shadow is needed.\"\n\nExplanation: \nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, the camel is a vital animal known for its resilience and ability to carry heavy loads across vast deserts. The idiom \"Even the camel's shadow is needed\" captures the essence of being overwhelmed with work to the point that even the most insignificant help (like the shadow of a camel, which cannot physically assist) is desired. This imagery reflects the importance of camels in Middle Eastern culture while conveying a similar sense of extreme busyness as the original Japanese idiom."

The final image is a distressed face (\ud83d\ude29) and a clock (\u23f0), indicating being extremely busy or pressed for time.\n\nCombining these elements, we get: \n- \"\u732b\" (cat) \n- \"\u624b\" (hand) \n- needing help (\ud83e\udd32) \n- and being extremely busy (\ud83d\ude29\u23f0).\n\nThis illustrates the Japanese idiom '\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044' (neko no te mo karitai), which means \"to be so busy that you would even welcome the help of a cat.\"\n\nNew idiom: \"As busy as a camel in a desert bazaar.\"\n\nExplanation: \nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, camels are integral to daily life and commerce, especially in desert regions where bazaars (markets) are bustling hubs of activity. A camel in a desert bazaar would be extremely busy carrying goods, navigating the crowds, and performing various tasks. This imagery captures the essence of being extremely busy, similar to the Japanese idiom '\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044'.\n\nBy using the camel and bazaar imagery, the new idiom conveys a sense of overwhelming busyness and the need for additional help, drawing on the cultural context of Middle Eastern markets where activity is constant and intense.",
            "Puzzle: \ud83d\udc08 + \ud83d\udd90\ufe0f + \ud83d\udd19 + \u23f0\n\nSolution: \n1. The cat emoji (\ud83d\udc08) represents \"\u732b\" (neko), which means \"cat\" in Japanese.\n2. The hand emoji (\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f) represents \"\u624b\" (te), which means \"hand.\"\n3. The back arrow emoji (\ud83d\udd19) represents the concept of borrowing, as in \"\u501f\u308a\u308b\" (kariru), which means \"to borrow.\"\n4. The clock emoji (\u23f0) signifies the urgency or busyness, aligning with the context of time.\n\nPutting these elements together, we get \"\u732b\u306e\u624b\u3082\u501f\u308a\u305f\u3044\" (neko no te mo karitai), which translates to \"Even want to borrow a cat's hand,\" meaning to be extremely busy.\n\nNew idiom: \"Even the camel's shadow is needed.\"\n\nExplanation: \nIn many Middle Eastern cultures, the camel is a vital animal known for its resilience and ability to carry heavy loads across vast deserts. The idiom \"Even the camel's shadow is needed\" captures the essence of being overwhelmed with work to the point that even the most insignificant help (like the shadow of a camel, which cannot physically assist) is desired. This imagery reflects the importance of camels in Middle Eastern culture while conveying a similar sense of extreme busyness as the original Japanese idiom."

            "content": "Given the task family \"cross_cultural_idiom_puzzles,\" here is my reasoning:\n\n1. **Linguistic Creativity**: LLMs are generally well-equipped to handle tasks requiring linguistic creativity, as they have been trained on diverse text corpora. They can generate creative and contextually appropriate text.\n\n2. **Cultural Knowledge**: LLMs have access to a vast amount of cultural knowledge from their training data. They can recognize and explain idioms from different languages and cultures to a reasonable extent.\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: LLMs can follow structured instructions and create puzzles like crosswords or word scrambles. They can also provide step-by-step solutions if the task is well-defined.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: While the task is difficult for humans due to the need for cross-cultural understanding and creativity, LLMs have the advantage of their extensive training data which includes idiomatic expressions and cultural references.\n\nThe scoring is done via `eval_with_llm_judge`, which means the evaluation is consistent with how the LLM would understand and generate language, making it a suitable method for this task.\n\n**Decision**: No\n\nThe success of the LLM agent on this task is not surprising. Given the capabilities of modern LLMs in handling linguistic creativity, cultural knowledge, and structured problem-solving, it is expected that an LLM could successfully complete this task."
