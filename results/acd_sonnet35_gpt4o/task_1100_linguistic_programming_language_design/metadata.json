            "1. Language Design:\n\na) Key Features: \nThe programming language, \"KiswahiliCode\", is designed to emulate the grammatical structure of Swahili. Key features include:\n- Simple and readable syntax.\n- Variable names and functions use Swahili words.\n- Control structures align with Swahili's word order (SVO - Subject, Verb, Object).\n- Functions and loops use Swahili conjunctions and prepositions.\n\nb) Grammatical Structures:\nKiswahiliCode incorporates the agglutinative nature of Swahili by using prefixes and suffixes for different operations. For example, variable declarations and loops use Swahili words like \"weka\" (put/set) and \"kwa\" (for).\n\nc) Syntax Examples:\n- Variables: `weka x = 5`\n- Functions: `kazi hesabuFibonacci(n) { ... }`\n- Control Structures:\n```\nikiwa (x > 5) {\n    fanya (print(\"x ni kubwa\"))\n}\nkwa (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n    fanya (print(i))\n}\n```\n\nd) Handling Unique Aspects:\nSwahili tonal systems are not directly applicable. However, noun class prefixes like \"ki-\" and \"ma-\" are used for namespaces and collections. Word order and agglutinative properties simplify nested structures and concatenations.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\n\na) Relation to Swahili Structures:\nKiswahiliCode mirrors Swahili's simple, direct grammatical structure. By using Swahili conjunctions and prepositions, the language maintains natural readability for Swahili speakers.\n\nb) Challenges:\nOne challenge was adapting Swahili's noun classes and verb conjugations into a programming context. Also, ensuring that the language remained flexible enough for various programming paradigms while staying true to Swahili grammar was difficult.\n\nc) Influence on Thought Processes:\nKiswahiliCode encourages programmers to think in a linear, structured manner, similar to forming sentences in Swahili. This could make the language more intuitive for native Swahili speakers and promote a natural flow in coding.\n\n3. Problem Solution:\n\na) Fibonacci Sequence Solution:\n```\nkazi hesabuFibonacci(n) {\n    weka a = 0\n    weka b = 1\n    weka i = 0\n    kwa (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        weka temp = a\n        a = b\n        b = temp + b\n    }\n    rudisha a\n}\nweka n = 10\nprint(hesabuFibonacci(n))\n```\n\nb) Step-by-Step Explanation:\n- Define a function `hesabuFibonacci` taking `n` as input.\n- Initialize `a` to 0 and `b` to 1.\n- Use a for-loop to iterate `n` times.\n- Swap values of `a` and `b` and update `b`.\n- Return the value of `a` after the loop.\n- Call the function with `n = 10` and print the result.\n\nc) Unique Features:\nUsing Swahili syntax and structure makes the code more readable for Swahili speakers. The natural flow of Swahili grammar simplifies understanding loops and conditionals.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n\na) Comparison to Existing Languages:\nKiswahiliCode is similar to Python in its readability but incorporates Swahili grammatical structures. Unlike languages like C++ or Java, it uses simpler syntax.\n\nb) Advantages and Disadvantages:\nAdvantages include intuitive syntax for Swahili speakers and natural readability. Disadvantages might include a steeper learning curve for non-Swahili speakers and potential limitations in expressing more advanced programming concepts.\n\nc) Suitability:\nKiswahiliCode is particularly suited for educational purposes in Swahili-speaking regions, as well as for projects that benefit from natural language processing in Swahili.\n\n5. Future Developments:\n\na) Extensions or Modifications:\n- Implementing support for object-oriented programming.\n- Adding libraries for common tasks like web development and data analysis.\n\nb) Applying Design Process:\nThis process could be applied to other languages by identifying key grammatical structures and natural syntax patterns, making programming more accessible to native speakers.\n\nc) Research Question:\nHow does programming in a natural language-based syntax influence problem-solving approaches and cognitive load for native speakers?",
            "1. Language Design:\na) Key features of the programming language \"KiswahiliCode\" include a simple syntax inspired by Swahili grammar, ease of readability, and an emphasis on verb-centric commands. Variables are declared with the word \"ni\" (is), and functions use the verb \"fanya\" (do). Control structures rely on Swahili's natural word order, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).\nb) KiswahiliCode incorporates Swahili grammatical structures by using prefixes and suffixes to denote tense and aspect, similar to Swahili verbs. For instance, \"andika\" (write) becomes \"kuandika\" (to write) for infinitives.\nc) Example syntax:\n   - Variable declaration: `x ni 5`\n   - Function definition: `fanya kuhesabu(x) { kurudi x * 2 }`\n   - If statement: `ikiwa x > 5 { andika \"x ni kubwa\" }`\nd) KiswahiliCode handles unique aspects of Swahili by using prefixes like \"ku-\" for infinitives and \"ki-\" for conditional clauses, maintaining the Subject-Verb-Object order, and avoiding complex tonal systems by relying on consistent verb forms.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\na) KiswahiliCode mirrors Swahili\u2019s natural language structures by using verb-centric commands and a straightforward SVO order. The language\u2019s simplicity and regularity make it intuitive for Swahili speakers.\nb) Challenges included adapting Swahili's agglutinative nature to programming constructs while maintaining readability and simplicity. Ensuring that tense and aspect markers did not complicate the syntax was also difficult.\nc) KiswahiliCode may influence programmers to think in terms of actions and results, due to its verb-centric nature, potentially leading to more intuitive problem-solving approaches.\n\n3. Problem Solution:\na) To calculate the Fibonacci sequence in KiswahiliCode:\n```\nfanya fibonacci(n) {\n    ikiwa n <= 1 { kurudi n }\n    vinginevyo { kurudi fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) }\n}\nandika fibonacci(10)\n```\nb) Explanation:\n   - `fanya fibonacci(n) { ... }`: Defines a function named `fibonacci` that takes a parameter `n`.\n   - `ikiwa n <= 1 { kurudi n }`: If `n` is less than or equal to 1, return `n`.\n   - `vinginevyo { kurudi fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) }`: Otherwise, return the sum of `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`.\n   - `andika fibonacci(10)`: Prints the result of `fibonacci(10)`.\nc) KiswahiliCode's verb-centric commands and clear conditional structures made implementing the Fibonacci sequence straightforward and readable.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\na) Compared to languages like Python, KiswahiliCode has a simpler and more intuitive syntax for Swahili speakers, but it might lack the extensive libraries and community support of more established languages.\nb) Advantages include ease of learning for Swahili speakers and readability. Disadvantages might be limited functionality and a smaller user base.\nc) KiswahiliCode is particularly suited for educational purposes and introductory programming courses for Swahili speakers.\n\n5. Future Developments:\na) Potential extensions include adding object-oriented features and integrating more advanced data structures.\nb) The design process for KiswahiliCode could be applied to other natural languages by identifying key grammatical structures and adapting them to programming constructs.\nc) A research question might be: How does programming in a natural language-based syntax affect cognitive load and problem-solving efficiency in novice programmers?",
            "1. Language Design:\n   a) My programming language, \"Kifaranga\" (Swahili for \"chick\"), features simple and intuitive syntax inspired by Swahili. Key features include straightforward variable declarations, functions, and control structures. It supports both procedural and functional paradigms.\n   b) Kifaranga incorporates Swahili's Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, noun class system, and agglutinative nature. For example, variables and functions are named using Swahili nouns and verbs, and control structures follow Swahili sentence structures.\n   c) Example syntax:\n      - Variables: `variable(x = 5)` (Declares x and assigns it 5)\n      - Functions: `function(jumla(a, b) { return(a + b) })` (Defines a function named 'jumla' to add two numbers)\n      - Control structures: `kama (x > 5) { soma(\"kubwa\") }` (If x > 5, print \"kubwa\")\n   d) Kifaranga handles Swahili's noun classes by prefixing variable names with class markers (e.g., `mtu` for person). Tonal features are not directly implemented due to the textual nature of programming.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\n   a) Kifaranga mimics Swahili's grammatical structure by using SVO order and noun class prefixes. This makes the language intuitive for Swahili speakers.\n   b) A challenge was adapting Swahili's rich noun class system to a programming context, requiring clear rules for variable naming and function definitions.\n   c) Kifaranga's design encourages programmers to think in Swahili syntax, potentially simplifying learning for Swahili speakers and fostering a more natural thought process in their native language.\n\n3. Problem Solution:\n   a) Kifaranga solution for the Fibonacci sequence:\n      ```\n      function fibonacci(n) {\n          kama (n == 0) { return(0) }\n          kama (n == 1) { return(1) }\n          ni (a = 0, b = 1, i = 2)\n          wakati (i <= n) {\n              ni (c = a + b)\n              ni (a = b)\n              ni (b = c)\n              ni (i = i + 1)\n          }\n          return(b)\n      }\n      soma(fibonacci(10))\n      ```\n   b) Explanation:\n      - `function fibonacci(n)` defines the Fibonacci function.\n      - `kama (n == 0) { return(0) }` and `kama (n == 1) { return(1) }` handle base cases.\n      - `ni` initializes variables a, b, and i.\n      - `wakati (i <= n)` is a while loop to compute Fibonacci numbers.\n      - `ni` updates the values of a, b, and i.\n      - `return(b)` returns the nth Fibonacci number.\n   c) Kifaranga's straightforward syntax and use of Swahili structures make it easy to read and understand, especially for Swahili speakers.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Compared to Python, Kifaranga is more verbose but aligns closely with Swahili syntax, making it accessible for Swahili speakers.\n   b) Advantages include natural syntax for Swahili speakers and clear structure. Disadvantages include verbosity and potential difficulty for non-Swahili speakers.\n   c) Kifaranga is well-suited for educational settings in Swahili-speaking regions and for applications requiring clear, human-readable code.\n\n5. Future Developments:\n   a) Extensions could include support for object-oriented programming and integration with existing libraries.\n   b) The design process can be applied to other languages by aligning syntax with their grammatical structures, enhancing accessibility.\n   c) A research question: How does programming in a native language influence cognitive load and problem-solving efficiency?",
            "1. Language Design:\na) The programming language, named 'KiswahiliCode', features a syntax inspired by Swahili's grammatical structure. Key features include:\n- Verb-object-subject (VOS) order for statements.\n- Inflectional prefixes and suffixes to denote tenses and aspects.\n- Use of noun classes to categorize variables and types.\n- Polymorphic functions to handle different data types seamlessly.\n\nb) KiswahiliCode incorporates Swahili grammatical structures by:\n- Using prefixes and suffixes to denote variable types and function behaviors.\n- Implementing VOS order, e.g., \"calculate fibonacci sequence\" instead of \"calculate sequence fibonacci.\"\n- Utilizing noun-class prefixes for variable declarations, reflecting Swahili's noun classification system.\n\nc) Examples:\n- Variable: `msemo x = 10;` (integer variable `x`)\n- Function: `kazi hesabuFibonacci(n) { ... }` (function `hesabuFibonacci` with parameter `n`)\n- Control: `ikiwa (n < 2) { rudi n; }` (if statement)\n\nd) Unique aspects:\n- Tones: Not encoded, as Swahili relies more on prefixes/suffixes than tonal variation.\n- Case structures: Handled through noun classes and verb inflections.\n- Word order: VOS order is a core syntax feature, ensuring natural Swahili-like readability.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\na) KiswahiliCode mirrors Swahili\u2019s natural structures by adopting its noun classes, verb conjugations, and word order. This makes the language intuitive for native Swahili speakers and helps in fostering a more natural coding experience.\nb) Challenges included adapting verb conjugations for programming logic and ensuring that the VOS order didn't conflict with conventional programming logic. Additionally, balancing readability and functionality required careful design.\nc) KiswahiliCode encourages a more natural flow of thought for Swahili speakers, likely making programming more accessible. The structure promotes clear, concise code that aligns with natural language processing.\n\n3. Problem Solution:\na) Code:\n```\nkazi hesabuFibonacci(n) {\n    ikiwa (n < 2) {\n        rudi n;\n    }\n    msemo a = 0;\n    msemo b = 1;\n    msemo matokeo = 0;\n    kwa (msemo i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        matokeo = a + b;\n        a = b;\n        b = matokeo;\n    }\n    rudi matokeo;\n}\n\nmsemo n = 10;\nandika(hesabuFibonacci(n));\n```\nb) Explanation:\n- `hesabuFibonacci` function calculates Fibonacci numbers.\n- Base case: returns `n` if `n` < 2.\n- Initializes variables `a`, `b`, and `matokeo`.\n- Iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` to hold the last two Fibonacci numbers.\n- Returns `matokeo` as the `n`th Fibonacci number.\n- Calls the function with `n = 10` and prints the result.\nc) Unique features like VOS order and noun class prefixes make the code more aligned with Swahili grammar, enhancing readability for Swahili speakers.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\na) Compared to languages like Python or Java, KiswahiliCode is more linguistically intuitive for Swahili speakers due to its adherence to Swahili grammar. However, it may be less familiar to non-Swahili speakers.\nb) Advantages include enhanced readability and accessibility for Swahili speakers. Disadvantages might include a steeper learning curve for those unfamiliar with Swahili grammatical structures.\nc) KiswahiliCode is particularly suited for educational contexts in Swahili-speaking regions, making programming more accessible. It may also excel in natural language processing tasks due to its alignment with natural language syntax.\n\n5. Future Developments:\na) Potential extensions include adding support for more complex data structures and enhancing integration with existing libraries. Another modification could be the implementation of a more sophisticated error-handling system.\nb) The design process can be applied to other natural languages by adapting their grammatical structures and syntax rules, making programming more inclusive globally.\nc) A research question could be: \"How does programming in a natural language-inspired syntax affect cognitive load and problem-solving efficiency among native speakers?\"",
            "1. Language Design:\na) Key features of the programming language include:\n   - Syntax that mimics Swahili sentence structures, emphasizing subject-verb-object (SVO) order.\n   - Keywords and functions named using Swahili vocabulary.\n   - Use of prefix and suffix conjugation to indicate different programming constructs, akin to Swahili verb conjugations.\n   - Simple and intuitive type system aligned with Swahili's noun classes.\n\nb) The language incorporates grammatical structures from Swahili by:\n   - Using Swahili prefixes for variable declarations (e.g., \"ni\" for defining variables).\n   - Employing subject prefixes (e.g., \"ni-\" for \"I\", \"u-\" for \"you\") to denote function definitions and calls.\n   - Utilizing verb conjugations to indicate actions (e.g., \"andika\" for \"write/print\").\n   - Placing the main verb before the object, maintaining the SVO order.\n\nc) Basic syntax examples:\n   - Variables: `ni x = 5`\n   - Functions: `uandika(x) { rudisha x + 1 }`\n   - Control Structures: `kama (x > 5) { andika(\"Kubwa\") }`\n\nd) Handling unique aspects of Swahili:\n   - Tonal systems are not explicitly represented as they are non-critical for programming.\n   - Case structures are handled using prefixes and suffixes.\n   - Word order is strictly maintained to follow SVO, making the language more intuitive for native Swahili speakers.\n\n2.

            "1. Language Design:\na) Key Features: The programming language, called KiswahiliCode, is designed to be intuitive for Swahili speakers. It features a simple syntax that mirrors the subject-verb-object (SVO) order of Swahili, uses prefixes and suffixes to denote variable types and operations, and incorporates noun classes for data structures. Keywords and function names are derived from Swahili vocabulary.\nb) Incorporation of Swahili Grammar: KiswahiliCode uses the SVO order, and employs noun classes as type indicators. For example, \"mtu\" (person) could represent an object type. Prefixes like \"ku-\" (to) signify functions, and suffixes like \"-a\" (of) indicate ownership or association.\nc) Basic Syntax:\n   - Variables: \"nambari x = 5\" (number x = 5)\n   - Functions: \"kuongeza(x, y) { rudi x + y }\" (add(x, y) { return x + y })\n   - Control Structures: \"kama (x > y) { fanya ... }\" (if (x > y) { do ... })\nd) Handling Unique Aspects of Swahili: KiswahiliCode does not incorporate tonal systems, as they are not prominent in Swahili. Case structures are handled through prefixes and suffixes, while word order is strictly SVO. For instance, \"kama\" (if) statements follow the natural flow of Swahili sentences.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\na) Relation to Natural Language: KiswahiliCode closely follows Swahili syntax and structure, making it intuitive for native speakers. It uses familiar grammatical constructs like noun classes and verb prefixes.\nb) Challenges: Adapting flexible Swahili grammar to the rigid syntax of programming languages was challenging. Ensuring clear and unambiguous commands while maintaining natural language flow required careful design.\nc) Influence on Thought Processes: KiswahiliCode encourages programmers to think in their native language, potentially reducing cognitive load. It promotes a natural flow of logic, aligning programming structures with everyday communication.\n\n3. Problem Solution:\na) Sorting Algorithm:\n```\nfanyasort(arr) {\n    kwa (i = 0; i < urefu(arr) - 1; i++) {\n        kwa (j = 0; j < urefu(arr) - i - 1; j++) {\n            kama (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n                temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n                arr[j + 1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    rudi arr;\n}\n```\nb) Explanation: The function \"fanyasort\" (do sort) takes an array \"arr\". It uses two nested loops to iterate through the array. The \"kama\" (if) statement checks if adjacent elements are out of order, and swaps them if necessary. The sorted array is returned.\nc) Unique Features: The use of Swahili keywords makes the logic more accessible to native speakers. The SVO order and familiar syntax help in understanding and debugging the code.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\na) Comparison to Existing Languages: KiswahiliCode is similar to Python in its readability and use of natural language constructs. However, it is unique in its incorporation of Swahili grammar and vocabulary.\nb) Advantages and Disadvantages: Advantages include ease of use for Swahili speakers and intuitive syntax. Disadvantages might include a steep learning curve for non-Swahili speakers and limited existing libraries.\nc) Suitability: KiswahiliCode is particularly suited for educational purposes in Swahili-speaking regions and for projects aimed at local communities.\n\n5. Future Developments:\na) Extensions: Introducing advanced data structures and integrating with popular libraries. Adding support for concurrent programming.\nb) Application to Other Languages: The design process can be applied to other natural languages by identifying key grammatical structures and vocabulary, then mapping them to programming constructs.\nc) Research Question: How does the use of native language programming impact the learning curve and problem-solving efficiency of novice programmers?",

It features a syntax that mirrors the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, uses prefixes and suffixes for variable types and scopes, and emphasizes readability and simplicity. It supports dynamic typing, functions as first-class objects, and has built-in concurrency features inspired by Swahili's fluid sentence structures.\n\nb) Incorporation of Swahili Grammar:\nKujenga uses Swahili's SVO word order in its syntax. For example, a variable declaration in Kujenga follows the pattern `n-ingiza jina=\"value\"` (let name=\"value\"). Functions are defined using the verb \"fanya\" (to do), and control structures use clear, Swahili-based keywords.\n\nc) Basic Syntax:\n- Variables: `n-ingiza jina=\"value\"`\n- Functions: `fanya onyesha(jina) { andika jina; }`\n- Control Structures: `ikiwa (hali) { // do something }`\n\nd) Handling Unique Aspects:\nSwahili's lack of case distinction simplifies keyword design. Kujenga uses prefixes like `n-` for variable declarations and `f-` for functions. The tonal system of Swahili is not directly represented, but the natural flow of code mimics Swahili's readability. Word order is strictly maintained to ensure clarity.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\na) Relation to Natural Language:\nKujenga mirrors Swahili's grammatical structures, making it intuitive for native Swahili speakers. The SVO order is preserved to maintain readability and natural flow.\n\nb) Challenges:\nAdapting Swahili's agglutinative nature to a programming context required careful consideration of prefixes and suffixes to avoid ambiguity. Ensuring that the language remained clear and unambiguous while staying true to Swahili's grammar was challenging.\n\nc) Influence on Thought Processes:\nKujenga encourages programmers to think in a structured, step-by-step manner, reflecting Swahili's clear and logical sentence construction. This can lead to more readable and maintainable code.\n\n3. Problem Solution:\na) Sorting Algorithm in Kujenga:\n```kujenga\nfanya panga(array) {\n    n-ingiza n=urefu(array);\n    kwa (i=0; i<n-1; i++) {\n        kwa (j=0; j<n-i-1; j++) {\n            ikiwa (array[j] > array[j+1]) {\n                n-ingiza muda=array[j];\n                array[j]=array[j+1];\n                array[j+1]=muda;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    rudisha array;\n}\n\nn-ingiza namba=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];\nnamba=panga(namba);\nandika(namba);\n```\n\nb) Explanation:\nThe `panga` function sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm. It iterates through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The `kwa` loop handles iteration, and the `ikiwa` statement performs the comparison and swapping.\n\nc) Unique Features:\nThe SVO word order and clear syntax make the sorting algorithm easy to understand.

            "Answer: \n\n1. Language Design:\na) Key features of the programming language \"KiswahiliCode\" include a simple syntax inspired by Swahili grammar, ease of readability, and an emphasis on verb-centric commands. Variables are declared with the word \"ni\" (is), and functions use the verb \"fanya\" (do). Control structures rely on Swahili's natural word order, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).\nb) KiswahiliCode incorporates Swahili grammatical structures by using prefixes and suffixes to denote tense and aspect, similar to Swahili verbs. For instance, \"andika\" (write) becomes \"kuandika\" (to write) for infinitives.\nc) Example syntax:\n   - Variable declaration: `x ni 5`\n   - Function definition: `fanya kuhesabu(x) { kurudi x * 2 }`\n   - If statement: `ikiwa x > 5 { andika \"x ni kubwa\" }`\nd) KiswahiliCode handles unique aspects of Swahili by using prefixes like \"ku-\" for infinitives and \"ki-\" for conditional clauses, maintaining the Subject-Verb-Object order, and avoiding complex tonal systems by relying on consistent verb forms.\n\n2. Linguistic Analysis:\na) KiswahiliCode mirrors Swahili\u2019s natural language structures by using verb-centric commands and a straightforward SVO order.

            "Answer: \n\n1. **Language Design**\n\n   a) **Key Features of the Language:**\n   - **Variable declaration** and **assignment syntax** mimics noun class prefixes in Swahili.\n   - **Function definitions** use Swahili verb conjugation patterns.\n   - **Control structures** (if, while, for) are based on Swahili conditional forms.\n   - **Automatic memory management** similar to high-level languages like Python.\n   - **Dynamic typing** to reflect the fluid nature of Swahili word classes.\n\n   b) **Incorporation of Swahili Grammar:**\n   - **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)** word order is maintained.\n   - **Noun classes** are used to manage variable types.\n   - **Prefixes and infixes** are used to denote operations and conditions, similar to Swahili verb conjugations.\n\n   c) **Basic Syntax Examples:**\n   ```swahili\n   // Variable declaration\n   noun mtu = 10\n\n   // Function definition\n   verb ongeza(noun a, noun b) {\n       return a + b\n   }\n\n   // Control structure\n   kama (mtu > 5) {\n       chora(\"Zaidi ya tano\")\n   }\n   ```\n\n   d) **Handling Unique Aspects of Swahili:**\n   - **Tonal systems:** Not explicitly represented as Swahili tones do not affect grammatical structure.\n   - **Case structures:** Variables are managed using noun class prefixes.\n   - **Word order:** Maintains natural SVO order for readability and ease of transition for Swahili speakers.\n\n2. **Linguistic Analysis**\n\n   a) **Relation to Swahili Structures:**\n   - The language uses **noun classes** for variable types, reflecting Swahili's grammatical system.\n   - **Verb conjugations** are adapted for functions, making operations intuitive for Swahili speakers.\n   - **Control structures** mimic conditional forms from Swahili, ensuring a natural flow.\n\n   b) **Challenges:**\n   - **Adaptation of noun classes** to fit programming types was complex, requiring a balance between grammatical integrity and practical functionality.\n   - **Verb conjugations** needed to be simplified to avoid overly complex syntax.\n\n   c) **Influence on Programmer Thought Processes:**\n   - Programmers may think more in terms of **natural language** constructs, potentially making the language more intuitive for Swahili speakers.\n   - Encourages a more **contextual and relational** approach to problem-solving, similar to natural language use.\n\n3. **Problem Solution**\n\n   a) **Basic Sorting Algorithm:**\n   ```swahili\n   verb panga(noun orodha) {\n       noun n = urefu( orodha )\n       kwa (noun i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\n           kwa (noun j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {\n               kama (orodha[j] > orodha[j+1]) {\n                   noun muda = orodha[j]\n                   orodha[j] = orodha[j+1]\n                   orodha[j+1] = muda\n               }\n           }\n       }\n       return orodha\n   }\n\n   noun orodha = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n   orodha = panga(orodha)\n   chora(orodha)\n   ```\n\n   b) **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n   - **Function Definition:** `panga` function takes a list `orodha` and sorts it.\n   - **Nested Loops:** Outer loop iterates over each element, inner loop compares adjacent elements.\n   - **Swapping Elements:** If elements are out of order, they are swapped.\n   - **Return Sorted List:** The sorted list is returned and printed.\n\n   c) **Unique Language Features:**\n   - **Noun classes** for variable types make the code more readable and intuitive.\n   - **Swahili-based control structures** make the loops and conditions easy to understand for Swahili speakers.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis**\n\n   a) **Comparison to Existing Languages:**\n   - Similar to **Python** in terms of high-level constructs and readability.\n   - Incorporates **natural language features** like COBOL but more focused on Swahili grammar.\n\n   b) **Advantages and Disadvantages:**\n   - **Advantages:** Natural flow for Swahili speakers, intuitive syntax, clear structure.\n   - **Disadvantages:** May be less familiar to non-Swahili speakers, initial learning curve for those unfamiliar with Swahili grammar.\n\n   c) **Suitability for Problems/Domains:**\n   - Particularly suited for **education** in Swahili-speaking regions.\n   - Useful for **linguistic research** and applications requiring natural language processing.\n\n5. **Future Developments**\n\n   a) **Potential Extensions:**\n   - **Integration with other languages:** Allow seamless integration with languages like Python or JavaScript.\n   - **Expanded library support:** Develop libraries for web development, data analysis, etc.\n\n   b) **Application to Other Languages:**\n   - The design process can be adapted to other **Bantu languages** or languages with rich grammatical structures.\n\n   c) **Research Question:**\n   - How does the use of natural language constructs in programming languages affect problem-solving efficiency and cognitive load for native speakers?"

            "content": "Given the task family \"linguistic_programming_language_design,\" let's analyze whether the success of the LLM agent is surprising or noteworthy based on the following aspects:\n\n1. **Task Complexity and Requirements**:\n   - The task requires a deep understanding of both linguistics and programming language design.\n   - It also demands creativity in incorporating grammatical structures from a natural language into a programming language, which is a non-trivial interdisciplinary challenge.\n   - The task includes multiple detailed sections: language design, linguistic analysis, problem solution, comparative analysis, and future developments.\n\n2. **Capabilities of LLMs**:\n   - LLMs are known to perform well in natural language understanding, generation, and even basic programming tasks.\n   - However, designing a new programming language based on linguistic structures and solving a specific problem using that language is an advanced task that typically requires human expertise and creativity.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the submission. This implies that another LLM is judging the quality of the response.\n   - While LLMs can be effective judges in certain contexts, evaluating the nuanced and interdisciplinary aspects of this task might be challenging for an LLM.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The estimated human difficulty is \"very difficult,\" indicating that even expert humans would find this task challenging.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy. It demonstrates an impressive level of interdisciplinary knowledge application, creativity, and problem-solving that goes beyond typical LLM capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
