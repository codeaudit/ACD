The riddles adhere to the nature theme by describing aspects of birdlife, which is a natural phenomenon. Each line of both riddles starts with consecutive letters of the alphabet: A, B, C for the main riddle and D, E for the hint riddle. The hint riddle relates to the main riddle by focusing on the delicate and colorful nature of birds, providing additional clues about their appearance and behavior without directly stating what they are. This subtle clue helps guide the solver towards the idea of birds while maintaining the challenge.",

The theme of nature is evident as frost is a natural phenomenon. Each line of the main riddle starts with consecutive letters: N, O, P, and Q. The hint riddle, which refers to \"snowflakes,\" provides a clue by describing something that falls from the sky and glistens, pointing towards a cold, icy phenomenon. This hint leads the reader to think of frost, which, like snowflakes, is associated with cold and ice. The hint riddle adheres to the same constraint with lines starting with F and G. The clever misdirection lies in using the concept of painting and lace to describe frost, adding a poetic touch to the riddle."

Main Riddle (3-5 lines):\n   - Compose a riddle that cleverly describes an object, concept, or phenomenon related to the given theme.\n   - Ensure your riddle adheres to the specified linguistic constraint.\n   - The riddle should be challenging but solvable with careful thought.\n\n2. Hint Riddle (2-3 lines):\n   - Create a second, shorter riddle that serves as a hint for the main riddle.\n   - This hint riddle should also adhere to the same theme and linguistic constraint.\n   - It should provide a subtle clue without giving away the answer to the main riddle.\n\n3. Explanation (4-5 sentences):\n   - Provide the solution to your main riddle.\n   - Explain how your riddles incorporate the given theme.\n   - Describe how you adhered to the linguistic constraint in both riddles.\n   - Highlight any particularly clever wordplay or misdirection used in your riddles.\n   - Explain how the hint riddle relates to and provides a clue for the main riddle.\n\nEnsure your riddles are original, engaging, and demonstrate creative use of language while adhering to the theme and constraint.

Hint Riddle (2-3 lines):\n   - Create a second, shorter riddle that serves as a hint for the main riddle.\n   - This hint riddle should also adhere to the same theme and linguistic constraint.\n   - It should provide a subtle clue without giving away the answer to the main riddle.\n\n3. Explanation (4-5 sentences):\n   - Provide the solution to your main riddle.\n   - Explain how your riddles incorporate the given theme.\n   - Describe how you adhered to the linguistic constraint in both riddles.\n   - Highlight any particularly clever wordplay or misdirection used in your riddles.\n   - Explain how the hint riddle relates to and provides a clue for the main riddle.\n\nEnsure your riddles are original, engaging, and demonstrate creative use of language while adhering to the theme and constraint. Your explanation should show a clear understanding of the riddle-making process and how you've met all the requirements.\n\nFormat your response as follows:\n\nMain Riddle:\n[Your main riddle here]\n\nHint Riddle:\n[Your hint riddle here]\n\nExplanation:\n[Your explanation here]\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"Both riddles should be related to the theme '{t['theme']}'\",\n            f\"Both riddles should adhere to the constraint: {t['constraint']}\",\n            \"The main riddle should be original, challenging, but solvable\",\n            \"The hint riddle should provide a subtle clue for the main riddle without giving away the answer\",\n            \"The explanation should provide the correct solution to the main riddle\",\n            \"The explanation should clearly describe how the theme and constraint were incorporated in both riddles\",\n            \"The explanation should demonstrate how the hint riddle relates to the main riddle\",\n            \"The response should follow the specified format\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task specifications and the capabilities of current large language models (LLMs), here is my reasoning:\n\n1. **Linguistic Creativity and Logical Reasoning**: LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating creative text and adhering to logical constraints. They can often produce coherent and contextually appropriate content across various themes.\n\n2. **Adherence to Complex Rules**: Generating text that adheres to specific constraints, such as starting each line with consecutive letters of the alphabet, is challenging but within the capabilities of advanced LLMs. These models can follow detailed instructions and generate text that meets specified criteria.\n\n3. **Originality and Engagement**: Ensuring riddles are original and engaging adds an extra layer of difficulty. LLMs have access to vast amounts of training data, which helps in generating diverse and creative outputs. However, originality can sometimes be a challenge due to the model's tendency to produce outputs influenced by its training data.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The evaluation uses an LLM judge to assess the quality and adherence to criteria. These LLM judges can effectively evaluate content based on specified criteria, although there may be some limitations in assessing creativity and subtlety in hints.\n\nGiven these points, the task is indeed complex and challenging. However, the LLM's success in this task, while impressive, aligns with its demonstrated capabilities in generating creative, constrained text and solving complex linguistic problems. Therefore, the agent's success at this task is not unexpected or particularly surprising.\n\nDecision: No"
