            "**1. Ethical Framework Design**\n\n**a) Outline the key principles and concepts of your novel ethical framework.**\n\nThe framework, called \"Compassionate Wisdom Ethics\" (CWE), is built on four key principles:\n\n1. **Compassion**: Prioritizing empathy and care in decision-making processes.\n2. **Prudence**: Exercising wise judgment to balance various ethical considerations.\n3. **Justice**: Ensuring fairness and equity in resource distribution.\n4. **Integrity**: Maintaining consistency with moral values and principles.\n\n**b) Explain how it draws inspiration from Virtue Ethics while introducing new elements.**\n\nCWE draws from Virtue Ethics by emphasizing the development of moral character and virtues such as empathy, wisdom, fairness, and integrity. However, it introduces new elements by explicitly incorporating principles of justice and systemic equity, which are often implicit in traditional Virtue Ethics. CWE also emphasizes the practical application of these virtues in complex decision-making processes, such as those involving AI.\n\n**c) Discuss how your framework addresses potential limitations or criticisms of Virtue Ethics.**\n\nVirtue Ethics is sometimes criticized for being too individualistic and lacking clear action-guidance. CWE addresses these limitations by incorporating a principle of justice, which demands fairness in the distribution of resources, and by providing a structured approach to decision-making that can be applied in systemic contexts like healthcare.\n\n**d) Provide a name for your ethical framework and explain its significance.**\n\nThe name \"Compassionate Wisdom Ethics\" reflects its dual focus on empathy and wise judgment. \"Compassionate\" highlights the importance of empathy and care, while \"Wisdom\" emphasizes the need for prudent and fair decision-making.\n\n**2. Framework Application**\n\n**a) Apply your ethical framework to the scenario of AI-driven resource allocation in healthcare.**\n\nIn applying CWE to AI-driven resource allocation, the framework would prioritize decisions that maximize compassion, prudence, justice, and integrity. For instance, in deciding how to allocate limited medical resources, such as ventilators or vaccines, the AI system should be programmed to optimize for equitable access while considering the diverse needs of different patient populations.\n\n**b) Identify the key ethical issues and stakeholders involved in this scenario.**\n\nKey ethical issues include the fairness of resource distribution, the potential biases in AI algorithms, and the transparency of decision-making processes. Stakeholders include patients, healthcare providers, AI developers, policymakers, and the broader community.\n\n**c) Explain how your framework would guide decision-making in this context.**\n\nCWE would guide AI decision-making by ensuring that algorithms are designed to prioritize compassionate outcomes, such as treating the most vulnerable populations with care, while also being prudent by considering the long-term implications of resource allocation. Justice and integrity would be ensured by implementing transparent algorithms that are regularly audited for fairness and bias.\n\n**d) Discuss any potential conflicts or dilemmas that arise when applying your framework.**\n\nPotential conflicts might include balancing individual patient needs with broader public health goals or addressing disparities between different demographic groups. For example, prioritizing resources for the most vulnerable might conflict with the need to ensure overall public health safety.\n\n**3. Comparative Analysis**\n\n**a) Compare your framework's approach to this scenario with that of traditional Virtue Ethics.**\n\nTraditional Virtue Ethics focuses on the character of individuals making decisions, which can be somewhat abstract in the context of AI. CWE, however, provides concrete principles (compassion, prudence, justice, integrity) that can be directly integrated into AI algorithms, offering more actionable guidance for systemic healthcare decisions.\n\n**b) Identify at least two other ethical theories and briefly contrast their potential approaches.**\n\n1. **Utilitarianism**: Would focus on maximizing overall happiness, potentially at the expense of fairness or equity for minority groups.\n2. **Deontology**: Would emphasize adherence to moral rules, such as not discriminating, but might lack the flexibility to adapt to complex, real-world scenarios where competing goods must be balanced.\n\n**c) Argue for the advantages of your framework in addressing this specific scenario.**\n\nCWE offers a balanced approach that integrates compassion and fairness, ensuring that resource allocation is not only efficient but also equitable. By focusing on virtues that can be operationalized within AI systems, CWE provides actionable guidance while addressing systemic biases and promoting transparency.\n\n**4. Practical Implementation**\n\n**a) Propose guidelines or a decision-making process based on your framework for addressing AI-driven resource allocation in healthcare.**\n\n1. **Define Objectives**: Ensure AI systems prioritize compassionate care, fairness, and prudent judgment.\n2. **Develop Criteria**: Create transparent criteria for resource allocation based on need, equity, and long-term outcomes.\n3. **Audit Algorithms**: Regularly review AI algorithms for biases and fairness.\n4. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Include diverse stakeholders in the development and oversight of AI systems.\n\n**b) Discuss potential challenges in implementing your framework in real-world situations.**\n\nChallenges include overcoming existing biases in data, ensuring stakeholder participation, and balancing competing interests. There may also be resistance to changing established procedures and integrating new ethical guidelines into existing AI systems.\n\n**c) Suggest ways to measure the effectiveness and outcomes of applying your framework.**\n\nEffectiveness can be measured through regular audits of AI decisions for fairness and equity, patient satisfaction surveys, and health outcomes data. Additionally, tracking the inclusivity of stakeholder involvement in decision-making processes can provide insights into the framework's impact.\n\n**5. Critique and Reflection**\n\n**a) Identify potential weaknesses or limitations of your ethical framework.**\n\nCWE might be criticized for being overly idealistic or difficult to implement in practice, especially in emergency situations where rapid decisions are required. Balancing compassion with practical constraints might also be challenging.\n\n**b) Discuss how your framework might evolve or be refined based on its application to this scenario.**\n\nCWE could evolve by incorporating more specific guidelines for different healthcare contexts and by developing more robust methods for auditing and improving AI algorithms. Continuous feedback from stakeholders and real-world applications would help refine the framework.\n\n**c) Reflect on the implications of your framework for broader ethical discourse and decision-making.**\n\nCWE's emphasis on compassion and fairness could influence broader ethical discussions by highlighting the importance of empathy and equity in decision-making. It could also encourage the development of more holistic ethical frameworks that integrate individual virtues with systemic considerations, promoting more inclusive and just outcomes in various fields.",

Your total response should be between 1050-1300 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of ethical theories and philosophical concepts.\",\n            \"The proposed ethical framework is novel, well-defined, and coherently draws inspiration from the given ethical principle.\",\n            \"The application of the framework to the given scenario is thorough, addressing key ethical issues and stakeholders.\",\n            \"The comparative analysis shows critical thinking and a nuanced understanding of different ethical approaches.\",\n            \"The practical implementation guidelines are clear, realistic, and demonstrate an understanding of real-world challenges.\",\n            \"The critique and reflection section shows self-awareness and the ability to identify potential weaknesses in the proposed framework.\",\n            \"The overall response is well-structured, following the specified format and word count guidelines.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family \"ethical_framework_design_and_application,\" here are a few considerations:\n\n1. **Complexity and Depth**: The task requires designing a novel ethical framework, applying it to a complex scenario, and performing comprehensive analyses. This involves abstract reasoning, ethical analysis, philosophical creativity, and practical application of ethical concepts, all of which are challenging even for humans.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is \"very difficult,\" which means that even subject matter experts might struggle with this task. It requires a deep understanding of ethical theories and the ability to create and apply new philosophical concepts.\n\n3. **Capabilities of LLMs**: Large language models generally excel at generating coherent text and can handle complex queries to a certain extent. However, tasks that require deep philosophical reasoning, creativity, and the application of abstract concepts to real-world scenarios are particularly challenging. LLMs may not have the nuanced understanding of moral philosophy and the ability to create truly novel frameworks in the same way a human expert can.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The evaluation is done using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which raises concerns about the judge's ability to accurately assess the depth and novelty of philosophical reasoning. LLMs evaluating other LLMs on such complex tasks might not provide a reliable measure of success.\n\nConsidering these factors, if the LLM agent succeeded in this task, it would be quite surprising given the high complexity and the need for deep philosophical creativity and reasoning. It would be noteworthy because it suggests that the LLM has advanced capabilities in areas traditionally considered challenging for automated systems.\n\nDecision: Yes"
