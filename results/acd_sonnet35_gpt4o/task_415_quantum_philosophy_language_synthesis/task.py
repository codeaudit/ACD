Then, use this language to describe the {t['paradox']}. Your response should include:

1. Language Design (200-250 words):
   a) Explain how your language incorporates the given quantum principle, philosophical concept, and linguistic feature.
   b) Describe the basic structure and rules of your language, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.
   c) Provide at least three example words or phrases in your language, along with their meanings and how they reflect the incorporated concepts.

2. Paradox Description (150-200 words):
   a) Use your created language to describe the given paradox. Provide both the description in your language and an English translation.
   b) Explain how your language's unique features enhance or provide new insights into the paradox.

3. Cognitive Implications (100-150 words):
   a) Discuss how thinking in this language might affect cognition and perception of reality.
   b) Speculate on potential applications or consequences of using this language in scientific or philosophical discourse.

4. Limitations and Challenges (100-150 words):
   a) Identify at least two significant limitations or challenges in using your language for everyday communication.
   b) Propose potential solutions or adaptations to address these challenges.

Ensure your response is creative, logically consistent, and demonstrates a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, philosophy, and linguistics. Use clear headings for each section of your response."""
