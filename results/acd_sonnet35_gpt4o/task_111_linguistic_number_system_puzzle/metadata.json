Express your answer as a list of prime factors in ascending order. If the number itself is prime, the list should contain only that number.\n\n2. You are playing a game with an opponent. You both have the prime factors you found in step 1. The game rule is to choose the largest prime factor. Your opponent will choose randomly. If you both choose the same factor, you win. If you choose different factors, the player who chose the largest factor wins.\n\nWhat prime factor should you choose to maximize your chances of winning? Consider that choosing the largest prime factor gives you the best chance of winning, as it ensures you win in all cases except when your opponent happens to choose the same factor.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nPrime factorization: [list of prime factors]\nChosen factor for the game: [your chosen factor]\n\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\nName of task family: math_cipher_messaging\nDescription: Create and decode messages using a custom cipher based on mathematical operations\nCapability being measured: logical reasoning, mathematical operations, and linguistic creativity\nEstimated human difficulty: difficult\nExample instruction: This task involves creating and decoding messages using a custom mathematical cipher. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a short message (1 sentence, maximum 15 words) related to the topic of space exploration.\n\n2. Encode your message using the following cipher:\n   - Convert each letter to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26).\n   - Multiply 3 to each number.\n   - If the result is greater than 26, subtract 26 until it's in the range 1-26.\n   - If the result is less than 1, add 26 until it's in the range 1-26.\n   - Convert the numbers back to letters.\n   - For division, round down to the nearest integer before converting back to a letter.\n\nExample: If the operation is 'add' and the key is 3:\n'HELLO' would become 'KHOOR' because:\nH(8) + 3 = 11 -> K\nE(5) + 3 = 8 -> H\nL(12) + 3 = 15 -> O\nL(12) + 3 = 15 -> O\nO(15) + 3 = 18 -> R\n\n3.

Spaces and punctuation should remain unchanged in the encoding process. The cipher is case-insensitive, so you may use uppercase or lowercase letters.\n\nNOTE: Strictly adhere to the format provided above.

Each word represents a number, and the value of each word is determined by a specific rule. Your task is to solve the given equation using this system.\n\nThe word-to-number mapping is as follows:\none: 10, two: 4, three: 7, four: 9, five: 1, six: 5, seven: 10, eight: 6, nine: 6, ten: 7\n\nThe rule for calculating the value of a word is based on its length:\n- If the rule is 'vowels', the value is multiplied by the number of vowels in the word.\n- If the rule is 'consonants', the value is multiplied by the number of consonants in the word.\n- If the rule is 'length', the value is multiplied by the length of the word.\n\nFor example, the word 'five' has a base value of 1. Using the 'length' rule, its final value would be 1 * 4 = 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the following equation: eight - seven\n\nPlease provide your answer in the following format:\n\n1.

            "content": "Given the task family described, let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Complexity of Task**:\n   - The task involves a fictional number system with specific rules for calculating word values.\n   - It requires linguistic reasoning to determine the number of vowels or consonants, or the length of words.\n   - It also involves basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - LLMs are generally good at understanding and generating text, including basic arithmetic operations.\n   - However, handling a fictional number system with specific rules and accurately performing operations on derived values can be challenging.\n   - The task requires a multi-step reasoning process, which LLMs can struggle with, especially under more complex and less straightforward instructions.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The task is estimated to be very difficult for humans, implying it requires careful attention to detail and multiple steps to reach the solution.\n   - This suggests that even experts might find it challenging to solve without making errors.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The task is evaluated using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which relies on the LLM's ability to follow the provided criteria accurately.\n\nConsidering these points, the failure of the LLM agent on this task is **not surprising**. The task involves a higher level of complexity and multi-step reasoning that LLMs generally find challenging. The need to follow specific rules for calculating values and then performing arithmetic correctly adds layers of difficulty that make failure expected for current LLM capabilities.\n\nThus, the decision is:\n\nDecision: No"
