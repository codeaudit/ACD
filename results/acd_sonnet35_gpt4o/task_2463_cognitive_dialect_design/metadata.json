            "**1. Dialect Overview**\n\n*a) Key Features:*\nThe cognitive dialect, termed \"Urbanese,\" integrates spatial and temporal markers into its grammar and lexicon. Its basic structure includes a unique set of prefixes and suffixes that denote spatial relationships (e.g., \"prox-\" for proximity, \"dist-\" for distance) and temporal sequences (e.g., \"chron-\" for chronological order, \"retro-\" for retrospective analysis). Urbanese also uses compound words to encapsulate complex spatial-temporal concepts, making it easier to convey intricate urban planning ideas concisely.\n\n*b) Enhancing Spatial-Temporal Reasoning:*\nUrbanese is designed to promote mental visualization and manipulation of spatial-temporal data. Its syntax forces users to think about spatial relationships and temporal sequences explicitly. For example, describing a building's location requires using a spatial marker prefix, which helps planners internalize the spatial layout of urban environments. Similarly, discussing development phases mandates temporal markers, fostering an understanding of the evolution of city layouts over time.\n\n*c) Example Phrases:*\n1. **Urbanese:** \"Prox-building-chron-phase1.\"\n   **English:** \"The building is in proximity to phase 1.\"\n   **Explanation:** This phrase requires the planner to consider both the spatial relationship (proximity) and the temporal phase (phase 1), enhancing their ability to visualize and plan spatially and temporally.\n   \n2. **Urbanese:** \"Dist-park-retro-5years.\"\n   **English:** \"The park was at a distance five years ago.\"\n   **Explanation:** The use of \"dist-\" and \"retro-\" encourages planners to think about past spatial arrangements, aiding in understanding urban development patterns.\n\n**2. Cognitive Enhancement Mechanism**\n\n*a) Theoretical Basis:*\nUrbanese is grounded in the theory of linguistic relativity, which posits that the structure of a language affects its speakers' cognition and worldview.
