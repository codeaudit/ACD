Advances in quantum biology and gravitational biology could provide more accurate parameters for the model.\n\nc) Impact of Advancements:\nAs our understanding of quantum information processing in biological systems and gravitational biology advances, the model can be refined to incorporate more precise mechanisms and interactions. This could lead to more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of life in extreme environments.\n\n"
