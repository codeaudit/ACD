I believe this task will be novel compared to the previously generated ones and will challenge the model in interesting ways.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"historical_cryptolinguistic_analysis\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Analyze and decode historical ciphers or codes, then use the decrypted information to solve linguistic and historical puzzles.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"cryptanalysis skills, linguistic knowledge, historical reasoning, and creative problem-solving\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        historical_ciphers = [\\n            {\\n                'name': 'Caesar Cipher',\\n                'period': 'Ancient Rome',\\n                'encrypted_text': 'YHQL YLGL YLFL',\\n                'key': 3,\\n                'historical_context': 'Julius Caesar\\\\'s famous declaration after a swift victory.'\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'name': 'Vigen\u00e8re Cipher',\\n                'period': 'Renaissance',\\n                'encrypted_text': 'LXFOPVEFRNHR',\\n                'key': 'LEMON',\\n                'historical_context': 'A message about a plot against Queen Elizabeth I.'\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'name': 'Playfair Cipher',\\n                'period': 'American Civil War',\\n                'encrypted_text': 'BMODZBXDNABEKUDMUIXMMOUVIF',\\n                'key': 'CONFEDERACY',\\n                'historical_context': 'A coded message about troop movements during the Battle of Gettysburg.'\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'name': 'ADFGVX Cipher',\\n                'period': 'World War I',\\n                'encrypted_text': 'FXFDAGDFFAAXFGFGAVDDGXDAVFX',\\n                'key': ('CRYPTOGRAPHY', 'ENIGMA'),\\n                'historical_context': 'A German military communication about a planned offensive on the Western Front.'\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        \\n        tasks = random.sample(historical_ciphers, 2)\\n        return {str(i+1): {'cipher': cipher} for i, cipher in enumerate(tasks)}\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Analyze and decode the following historical cipher, then use the decrypted information to solve a linguistic and historical puzzle:\\n\\nCipher Name: {t['cipher']['name']}\\nHistorical Period: {t['cipher']['period']}\\nEncrypted Text: {t['cipher']['encrypted_text']}\\nHistorical Context: {t['cipher']['historical_context']}\\n\\nYour task consists of the following steps:\\n\\n1.

Each of these requires a deep understanding and the ability to synthesize information from different domains.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Current LLMs have shown proficiency in handling tasks involving language understanding, historical context, and even some cryptographic elements. However, the integration of these capabilities into a coherent and accurate 1100-1450 word essay within a strict time constraint is significantly challenging.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` method is tasked with scoring the submission based on a detailed set of criteria. This is a reasonable approach, as the criteria are clear and specific, but it may not capture nuances perfectly due to the complexity of the task.\n\n4. **Human Comparison**: The task is described as \"very difficult\" for humans, indicating that it requires skills that are typically developed over years of specialized education and practice.\n\nGiven these considerations, the agent's success at such a complex, interdisciplinary task would indeed be surprising and noteworthy.
