            "### 1. Emotional-Linguistic Analysis\n\n#### 1a) Expressions of Gratitude\nIn Japanese culture, gratitude is often expressed with a high degree of formality and humility, especially when receiving a gift from a superior. Common phrases include \"\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\" (arigatou gozaimasu) and \"\u304a\u4e16\u8a71\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\" (osewa ni natte orimasu), which convey deep appreciation and acknowledgment of the giver's effort. In Brazilian culture, expressions of gratitude tend to be more effusive and personal. Phrases like \"Muito obrigado\" (thank you very much) and \"Eu agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (I thank you from the heart) are typically used, reflecting a warmer and more emotional tone.\n\n#### 1b) Key Linguistic Features\nJapanese gratitude expressions often include honorifics and polite forms to show respect and maintain social hierarchy. For example, using \"gozaimasu\" instead of a simpler \"arigatou\" elevates the formality. Sentence structures are carefully chosen to avoid directness, which can be seen as impolite. In contrast, Brazilian Portuguese employs a more direct and personal approach. Word choices are often emotionally charged, and the use of diminutives (e.g., \"obrigadinho\" for \"little thank you\") can add a layer of warmth.\n\n#### 1c) Cultural Norms and Taboos\nIn Japan, excessive expression of gratitude can be seen as insincere or embarrassing; maintaining a balance of humility and appreciation is crucial. Conversely, in Brazil, a lack of effusiveness can be interpreted as cold or ungrateful. Overly formal expressions might come off as distant, which is generally avoided in personal interactions.\n\n#### 1d) Example Phrases\n**Japanese:**\n1. \"\u3053\u306e\u5ea6\u306f\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u8d08\u308a\u7269\u3092\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u3001\u8aa0\u306b\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\" (Kono tabi wa suteki na okurimono o itadaki, makoto ni arigatou gozaimasu.) - \"Thank you very much for the wonderful gift.\"\n2. \"\u3054\u914d\u616e\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u3001\u611f\u8b1d\u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3002\" (Go hairyo itadaki, kansha moushiagemasu.) - \"I am grateful for your consideration.\"\n\n**Brazilian Portuguese:**\n1. \"Muito obrigado pelo presente maravilhoso, fiquei muito feliz!\" - \"Thank you very much for the wonderful gift, I am very happy!\"\n2. \"Agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o pelo presente, foi uma surpresa incr\u00edvel!\" - \"I thank you from the heart for the gift, it was an incredible surprise!\"\n\n### 2. AI System Design\n\n#### 2a) Architecture\nThe AI system will comprise two main components: an emotion detection module and an emotion generation module. The detection module will utilize natural language processing (NLP) to analyze text inputs, identifying emotional cues and contextual factors. The generation module will leverage a multilingual transformer model (e.g., mBERT or GPT-3) to produce culturally appropriate responses.\n\n#### 2b) Handling Cultural Differences\nThe system will include a cultural context layer that adjusts the emotional tone and formality based on the detected culture. This layer will use predefined cultural norms and linguistic databases to modulate the output. For example, if the input is identified as Japanese, the system will prioritize formality and indirectness.\n\n#### 2c) Training Data and Process\nThe training data will consist of diverse text corpora in Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese, annotated with emotional labels and cultural context. This data will be sourced from social media, literature, and conversational databases. Transfer learning techniques will be employed to fine-tune pre-trained models on this specific data, ensuring cultural nuances are captured.\n\n#### 2d) Pseudocode Snippet\n```python\ndef process_input(input_text, culture):\n    emotion = detect_emotion(input_text)\n    response = generate_response(emotion, culture)\n    return response\n\ndef detect_emotion(text):\n    # NLP model to detect emotion\n    return emotion_label\n\ndef generate_response(emotion, culture):\n    if culture == 'Japanese':\n        return generate_japanese_response(emotion)\n    elif culture == 'Brazilian':\n        return generate_brazilian_response(emotion)\n\ndef generate_japanese_response(emotion):\n    # Use transformer model fine-tuned for Japanese\n    return response\n\ndef generate_brazilian_response(emotion):\n    # Use transformer model fine-tuned for Brazilian Portuguese\n    return response\n\ninput_text = \"I'm so grateful for this gift!\"\nculture = \"Brazilian\"\noutput = process_input(input_text, culture)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### 3. Application and Limitations\n\n#### 3a) Applications\n1. **Multinational Business Communications:** The AI system can assist in drafting culturally appropriate emails and messages, ensuring respectful and effective communication across different cultures.\n2. **Customer Service:** Companies can use the system to provide more personalized and culturally sensitive responses to customer inquiries and complaints.\n\n#### 3b) Limitations\nThe system may struggle with nuanced cultural contexts that are not well-represented in the training data. Additionally, idiomatic expressions and slang can pose challenges. Real-time processing may also be limited by computational constraints.\n\n#### 3c) Ethical Concerns\nUsing AI for emotional communication raises concerns about authenticity and sincerity. There is also the risk of reinforcing stereotypes if the system overly generalizes cultural behaviors. Ensuring transparency and allowing users to understand how the AI generates responses are crucial ethical considerations.\n\n### 4. Evaluation Method\n\n#### 4a) Experiment Design\nThe experiment will involve native speakers from Japan and Brazil evaluating the AI-generated responses in controlled settings. Participants will be asked to rate the appropriateness, emotional accuracy, and cultural sensitivity of the responses.\n\n#### 4b) Methodology\nParticipants will receive a set of scenarios where they must respond to a gift from a superior. Responses will be generated by the AI and also manually by human experts. The ratings will be compared to measure the system's performance. Qualitative feedback will also be collected to understand any shortcomings.\n\n#### 4c) Metrics\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** Measured through participant ratings on a Likert scale.\n- **Emotional Accuracy:** Evaluated by comparing AI responses to human-generated ones.\n- **User Satisfaction:** Overall satisfaction scores from participants.\n- **Error Rate:** Frequency of culturally insensitive or inappropriate outputs.\n\nBy thoroughly analyzing emotional-linguistic features, designing an adaptive AI system, and rigorously testing it, we can develop a robust tool for cross-cultural emotional communication, while being mindful of its limitations and ethical implications.",
            "**1. Emotional-Linguistic Analysis**\n\n**1a) Expression of Gratitude in Japanese and Brazilian Cultures:**\nIn Japanese culture, expressing gratitude, especially towards a superior, involves a high degree of formality and humility. Gratitude is often expressed through words and body language, such as bowing. Phrases like \"\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\" (Arigatou gozaimasu) and \"\u611f\u8b1d\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\" (Kansha itashimasu) are commonly used. Non-verbal cues like bowing at different angles depending on the level of gratitude and respect are also significant.\n\nIn Brazilian culture, gratitude is expressed more openly and emotionally. People often use phrases like \"Muito obrigado/a\" (Thank you very much) and \"Eu agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (I thank you from the heart). Physical gestures such as hugging or a friendly pat on the back may accompany verbal expressions of thanks.\n\n**1b) Key Linguistic Features:**\nIn Japanese, gratitude expressions are formal, indirect, and often include honorifics. The sentence structure is polite and humble, reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society. For example, \"\u304a\u5fc3\u9063\u3044\u306b\u611f\u8b1d\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\" (O kokorozukai ni kansha itashimasu) translates to \"I am grateful for your consideration.\"\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese, expressions of gratitude are direct, enthusiastic, and often include personal pronouns and emotional intensifiers.

Emotional-Linguistic Analysis\n\n1a) Expression of Gratitude in Japanese and Brazilian Cultures:\nIn Japanese culture, expressing gratitude, especially towards a superior, involves a high degree of formality and humility. Gratitude is often expressed through words and body language, such as bowing. Phrases like \"\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\" (Arigatou gozaimasu) and \"\u611f\u8b1d\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\" (Kansha itashimasu) are commonly used. Non-verbal cues like bowing at different angles depending on the level of gratitude and respect are also significant.\n\nIn Brazilian culture, gratitude is expressed more openly and emotionally. People often use phrases like \"Muito obrigado/a\" (Thank you very much) and \"Eu agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (I thank you from the heart). Physical gestures such as hugging or a friendly pat on the back may accompany verbal expressions of thanks.\n\n1b) Key Linguistic Features:\nIn Japanese, gratitude expressions are formal, indirect, and often include honorifics. The sentence structure is polite and humble, reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society. For example, \"\u304a\u5fc3\u9063\u3044\u306b\u611f\u8b1d\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\" (O kokorozukai ni kansha itashimasu) translates to \"I am grateful for your consideration.\"\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese, expressions of gratitude are direct, enthusiastic, and often include personal pronouns and emotional intensifiers. For example, \"Estou muito agradecido/a pelo presente\" (I am very grateful for the gift) is a straightforward, heartfelt expression.\n\n1c) Cultural Taboos and Norms:\nIn Japan, overly effusive expressions of gratitude or physical contact can be seen as inappropriate and disrespectful. The focus is on maintaining harmony and showing respect through controlled, polite language and gestures.\n\nIn Brazil, failing to express gratitude openly and warmly can be perceived as rude or insincere.

AI System Design\n\n#### 2a) Architecture Overview\nThe AI system comprises several components:\n- **Emotion Detection Module**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text and detect emotions.\n- **Cultural Context Module**: Applies cultural norms and taboos to adjust emotional expression.\n- **Language Generation Module**: Uses context-aware NLP models to generate text.\n- **Feedback Loop**: Continuously improves the model with user feedback.\n\n#### 2b) Handling Cultural Differences\nThe system uses a cultural ontology database to understand cultural norms and context. It adjusts the tone, formality, and expression of gratitude based on the detected culture. For example, it would use more formal and humble language for Japanese contexts and more enthusiastic and affectionate language for Brazilian contexts.\n\n#### 2c) Training Data and Process\nThe system is trained on a diverse dataset comprising text from various cultural contexts, including formal and informal communications. It uses supervised learning with annotated data for emotions and cultural context. The AI is fine-tuned with reinforcement learning, where it receives feedback on the appropriateness of its responses.\n\n#### 2d) Pseudocode\n```python\nclass EmotionAI:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.cultural_db = CulturalOntology()\n        self.nlp_model = NLPModel()\n    \n    def process_input(self, text, culture):\n        emotion = self.nlp_model.detect_emotion(text)\n        adjusted_text = self.cultural_db.adjust_expression(emotion, text, culture)\n        return adjusted_text\n    \n    def generate_response(self, context, culture):\n        base_response = self.nlp_model.generate_base_response(context)\n        final_response = self.cultural_db.adjust_expression(context['emotion'], base_response, culture)\n        return final_response\n\n# Usage\nai_system = EmotionAI()\ninput_text = \"Thank you for the gift.\"\nculture = \"Japanese\"\noutput = ai_system.process_input(input_text, culture)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### 3. Application and Limitations\n\n#### 3a) Potential Applications\n1. **Multinational Corporations**: Assisting employees in crafting culturally appropriate communications, improving interpersonal relationships and business negotiations.\n2. **Language Learning Platforms**: Helping learners understand and practice culturally appropriate emotional expressions.\n\n#### 3b) Limitations and Challenges\n- **Cultural Nuances**: The system may struggle with subtle cultural nuances and context-specific expressions.\n- **Data Scarcity**: Limited availability of annotated datasets for specific cultural contexts can hinder training.\n- **Overgeneralization**: Risk of overgeneralizing cultural norms, leading to inappropriate expressions in unique scenarios.\n\n#### 3c) Ethical Concerns\n- **Stereotyping**: The system may reinforce cultural stereotypes if not carefully designed.\n- **Privacy**: Handling sensitive emotional data requires strict privacy and data protection measures.\n- **Bias**: Ensuring the training data is unbiased and representative is crucial to avoid perpetuating cultural biases.\n\n### 4. Evaluation Method\n\n#### 4a) Experiment Design\nThe experiment involves native speakers from Japanese and Brazilian cultures evaluating the AI's output. Participants receive a series of scenarios where the AI generates expressions of gratitude. They rate the appropriateness and emotional accuracy of the responses.\n\n#### 4b) Methodology\n- **Participants**: 50 native speakers from each culture.\n- **Procedure**: Present participants with 10 scenarios each and collect ratings on a 5-point Likert scale for appropriateness and emotional accuracy.\n- **Control Group**: Compare AI-generated responses with human-generated responses.\n\n#### 4c) Metrics\n- **Appropriateness Score**: Average rating of how culturally appropriate the response is.\n- **Emotional Accuracy Score**: Average rating of how well the response captures the intended emotion.\n- **Cultural Bias Index**: Measure of variance in ratings between different cultural groups.\n\nBy systematically evaluating these metrics, the effectiveness of the AI system in generating culturally nuanced emotional expressions can be assessed and improved."

            "**1. Emotional-Linguistic Analysis**\n\n**1a) Expression of Disagreement in British and Indian Cultures:**\nIn British business negotiations, disagreement is often expressed subtly and indirectly to maintain politeness and professionalism. Phrases like \"I see your point, but...\" or \"With all due respect...\" are common, reflecting a preference for maintaining harmony and avoiding confrontation. In contrast, Indian culture tends to be more direct in expressing disagreement, though still respectful. Phrases like \"I don't agree with that because...\" or \"That might not work due to...\" are typical, showing a more straightforward approach.\n\n**1b) Key Linguistic Features:**\nIn British English, disagreement often involves hedging, polite negations, and qualifiers. Words like \"perhaps\" and \"might\" soften the disagreement. Sentence structures are complex and indirect. In Indian English, disagreement is more direct with fewer hedges. Sentence structures are straightforward, and expressions are clearer. Idioms in British English like \"We might be barking up the wrong tree\" are less common in Indian English, where direct statements are preferred.\n\n**1c) Cultural Taboos and Norms:**\nBritish culture places a high value on politeness and avoiding direct confrontation, making overt disagreement a taboo in many contexts. Conversely, in Indian culture, while respect for hierarchy is crucial, direct communication is valued in professional settings for clarity. However, disagreeing with a senior or elder must be done with great respect.\n\n**1d) Example Phrases:**\n- British: \"I understand your perspective, but there might be a more effective approach.\"\n- British: \"With all due respect, I believe we should consider other options.\"\n- Indian: \"I don't think that's the best approach because...\"\n- Indian: \"That might not be feasible due to...\"\n\n**2. AI System Design**\n\n**2a) Architecture:**\nThe AI system will have two primary components: an Emotion Detection Module and an Emotion Generation Module. The Emotion Detection Module will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze input text and identify emotional cues indicating disagreement. The Emotion Generation Module will produce culturally appropriate responses based on detected emotions and cultural context.\n\n**2b) Handling Cultural Differences:**\nThe system will include a Cultural Context Database that contains rules and examples specific to British and Indian business contexts. When the Emotion Detection Module identifies a disagreement, it will reference this database to adjust its analysis and response generation accordingly.\n\n**2c) Training Data and Process:**\nTraining data will include transcripts of business negotiations, annotated with emotional cues and cultural context. Data will be sourced from diverse business environments in both cultures. The training process will involve supervised learning, using annotated data to train the system to recognize and generate culturally appropriate emotional responses.\n\n**2d) Pseudocode Snippet:**\n```python\ndef process_input(input_text, culture):\n    emotion = detect_emotion(input_text)\n    if emotion == 'disagreement':\n        cultural_context = get_cultural_context(culture)\n        response = generate_response(input_text, cultural_context)\n    return response\n\ndef detect_emotion(text):\n    # NLP model to detect emotions\n    return emotion\n\ndef get_cultural_context(culture):\n    # Retrieve cultural norms and linguistic features\n    return cultural_context\n\ndef generate_response(text, context):\n    # Generate a culturally appropriate response\n    return response\n```\n\n**3. Application and Limitations**\n\n**3a) Applications:**\n1. **Multinational Business Negotiations:** The AI system can assist in real-time translation and interpretation of emotional nuances, facilitating smoother negotiations and reducing misunderstandings.\n2. **Customer Service:** Companies can use the system to train customer service representatives to handle cross-cultural interactions more effectively, ensuring better customer satisfaction.\n\n**3b) Limitations:**\n1. **Data Limitations:** The system's accuracy depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the training data. Limited or biased data could affect performance.\n2. **Subtle Cultural Nuances:** Capturing the full complexity of cultural nuances in language may be challenging, leading to occasional inaccuracies.\n\n**3c) Ethical Concerns:**\nUsing AI for emotional communication raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulation. Ensuring transparency in how the system operates and obtaining consent from users are essential to address these issues.\n\n**4. Evaluation Method**\n\n**4a) Experiment Design:**\nTo evaluate the system, we will conduct a controlled experiment involving native speakers from both cultures. Participants will engage in simulated business negotiations with the AI system.\n\n**4b) Methodology:**\nParticipants will rate the system's responses on cultural appropriateness and emotional accuracy. We will use a Likert scale to gather quantitative data and conduct follow-up interviews for qualitative insights. Cultural experts will review the system's performance to identify biases.\n\n**4c) Metrics and Benchmarks:**\n- **Cultural Appropriateness Score:** Average rating from participants and experts on a scale of 1 to 5.\n- **Emotional Accuracy Rate:** Percentage of correctly identified and generated emotional responses.\n- **User Satisfaction Rate:** Percentage of participants satisfied with the system's performance.\n\nBy achieving high scores on these metrics, the system will demonstrate its effectiveness in handling cross-cultural emotional communication.",

            "**1. Emotional-Linguistic Analysis**\n\n**1a) Expression of Disagreement in British and Indian Cultures**\n\nIn British culture, disagreement in business negotiations is typically expressed with a high degree of politeness and indirectness. This approach aims to avoid confrontation and maintain harmonious relationships. Phrases such as \u201cI see your point, but...\u201d or \u201cWith all due respect...\u201d are commonly used to soften the impact of disagreement.\n\nIn contrast, Indian culture tends to be more hierarchical and context-sensitive. Disagreement may be more direct or indirect depending on the relative status of the participants and the context. However, indirect approaches are often preferred in order to avoid loss of face. Phrases like \u201cI understand your perspective, but...\u201d or \u201cMay I suggest another way...\u201d are typical.\n\n**1b) Key Linguistic Features**\n\nIn British English, disagreement often includes softeners like \u201cperhaps,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d The sentence structure tends to be complex, often employing conditional clauses to dilute the disagreement. Idioms such as \u201cnot quite\u201d or \u201ca bit of a stretch\u201d are also used.\n\nIndian English may use more deferential terms such as \u201csir\u201d or \u201cmadam\u201d and often includes honorifics. Sentence structures might be simpler but can involve elaborate justification to show respect. Phrases like \u201cwith due respect\u201d and \u201cif I may\u201d are common.\n\n**1c) Cultural Taboos and Norms**\n\nIn British culture, direct confrontation and overt criticism are generally avoided. It is considered impolite to openly challenge someone, especially in public settings. Maintaining a \u2018stiff upper lip\u2019 is valued.\n\nIn Indian culture, openly disagreeing with someone of higher status is taboo. Hierarchical respect is crucial, and saving face is important. Disagreement must be navigated carefully to avoid offending the other party.\n\n**1d) Example Phrases**\n\nBritish:\n1. \u201cI see where you\u2019re coming from, but I\u2019m not sure that will work in our context.\u201d\n2. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting point; however, I have a different perspective.\u201d\n\nIndian:\n1. \u201cWith due respect, sir, I believe we might need to consider an alternative approach.\u201d\n2. \u201cI understand your viewpoint, but perhaps we could also look at it this way.\u201d\n\n**2.

            "### 1. Emotional-Linguistic Analysis\n\n#### 1a) Expressions of Gratitude\nIn Japanese culture, gratitude is often expressed with a high degree of formality and humility, especially when receiving a gift from a superior. Common phrases include \"\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\" (arigatou gozaimasu) and \"\u304a\u4e16\u8a71\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\" (osewa ni natte orimasu), which convey deep appreciation and acknowledgment of the giver's effort. In Brazilian culture, expressions of gratitude tend to be more effusive and personal. Phrases like \"Muito obrigado\" (thank you very much) and \"Eu agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (I thank you from the heart) are typically used, reflecting a warmer and more emotional tone.\n\n#### 1b) Key Linguistic Features\nJapanese gratitude expressions often include honorifics and polite forms to show respect and maintain social hierarchy. For example, using \"gozaimasu\" instead of a simpler \"arigatou\" elevates the formality. Sentence structures are carefully chosen to avoid directness, which can be seen as impolite. In contrast, Brazilian Portuguese employs a more direct and personal approach. Word choices are often emotionally charged, and the use of diminutives (e.g., \"obrigadinho\" for \"little thank you\") can add a layer of warmth.\n\n#### 1c) Cultural Norms and Taboos\nIn Japan, excessive expression of gratitude can be seen as insincere or embarrassing; maintaining a balance of humility and appreciation is crucial. Conversely, in Brazil, a lack of effusiveness can be interpreted as cold or ungrateful. Overly formal expressions might come off as distant, which is generally avoided in personal interactions.\n\n#### 1d) Example Phrases\n**Japanese:**\n1. \"\u3053\u306e\u5ea6\u306f\u7d20\u6575\u306a\u8d08\u308a\u7269\u3092\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u3001\u8aa0\u306b\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\" (Kono tabi wa suteki na okurimono o itadaki, makoto ni arigatou gozaimasu.) - \"Thank you very much for the wonderful gift.\"\n2. \"\u3054\u914d\u616e\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u3001\u611f\u8b1d\u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3002\" (Go hairyo itadaki, kansha moushiagemasu.) - \"I am grateful for your consideration.\"\n\n**Brazilian Portuguese:**\n1. \"Muito obrigado pelo presente maravilhoso, fiquei muito feliz!\" - \"Thank you very much for the wonderful gift, I am very happy!\"\n2. \"Agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o pelo presente, foi uma surpresa incr\u00edvel!\" - \"I thank you from the heart for the gift, it was an incredible surprise!\"\n\n### 2. AI System Design\n\n#### 2a) Architecture\nThe AI system will comprise two main components: an emotion detection module and an emotion generation module. The detection module will utilize natural language processing (NLP) to analyze text inputs, identifying emotional cues and contextual factors. The generation module will leverage a multilingual transformer model (e.g., mBERT or GPT-3) to produce culturally appropriate responses.\n\n#### 2b) Handling Cultural Differences\nThe system will include a cultural context layer that adjusts the emotional tone and formality based on the detected culture. This layer will use predefined cultural norms and linguistic databases to modulate the output. For example, if the input is identified as Japanese, the system will prioritize formality and indirectness.\n\n#### 2c) Training Data and Process\nThe training data will consist of diverse text corpora in Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese, annotated with emotional labels and cultural context. This data will be sourced from social media, literature, and conversational databases. Transfer learning techniques will be employed to fine-tune pre-trained models on this specific data, ensuring cultural nuances are captured.\n\n#### 2d) Pseudocode Snippet\n```python\ndef process_input(input_text, culture):\n    emotion = detect_emotion(input_text)\n    response = generate_response(emotion, culture)\n    return response\n\ndef detect_emotion(text):\n    # NLP model to detect emotion\n    return emotion_label\n\ndef generate_response(emotion, culture):\n    if culture == 'Japanese':\n        return generate_japanese_response(emotion)\n    elif culture == 'Brazilian':\n        return generate_brazilian_response(emotion)\n\ndef generate_japanese_response(emotion):\n    # Use transformer model fine-tuned for Japanese\n    return response\n\ndef generate_brazilian_response(emotion):\n    # Use transformer model fine-tuned for Brazilian Portuguese\n    return response\n\ninput_text = \"I'm so grateful for this gift!\"\nculture = \"Brazilian\"\noutput = process_input(input_text, culture)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### 3. Application and Limitations\n\n#### 3a) Applications\n1. **Multinational Business Communications:** The AI system can assist in drafting culturally appropriate emails and messages, ensuring respectful and effective communication across different cultures.\n2. **Customer Service:** Companies can use the system to provide more personalized and culturally sensitive responses to customer inquiries and complaints.\n\n#### 3b) Limitations\nThe system may struggle with nuanced cultural contexts that are not well-represented in the training data. Additionally, idiomatic expressions and slang can pose challenges. Real-time processing may also be limited by computational constraints.\n\n#### 3c) Ethical Concerns\nUsing AI for emotional communication raises concerns about authenticity and sincerity. There is also the risk of reinforcing stereotypes if the system overly generalizes cultural behaviors. Ensuring transparency and allowing users to understand how the AI generates responses are crucial ethical considerations.\n\n### 4. Evaluation Method\n\n#### 4a) Experiment Design\nThe experiment will involve native speakers from Japan and Brazil evaluating the AI-generated responses in controlled settings. Participants will be asked to rate the appropriateness, emotional accuracy, and cultural sensitivity of the responses.\n\n#### 4b) Methodology\nParticipants will receive a set of scenarios where they must respond to a gift from a superior. Responses will be generated by the AI and also manually by human experts. The ratings will be compared to measure the system's performance. Qualitative feedback will also be collected to understand any shortcomings.\n\n#### 4c) Metrics\n- **Cultural Appropriateness:** Measured through participant ratings on a Likert scale.\n- **Emotional Accuracy:** Evaluated by comparing AI responses to human-generated ones.\n- **User Satisfaction:** Overall satisfaction scores from participants.\n- **Error Rate:** Frequency of culturally insensitive or inappropriate outputs.\n\nBy thoroughly analyzing emotional-linguistic features, designing an adaptive AI system, and rigorously testing it, we can develop a robust tool for cross-cultural emotional communication, while being mindful of its limitations and ethical implications.",

The formality reflects a respect for the superior's status and the collective harmony.\n\nConversely, in Brazilian culture, expressions of gratitude are typically more effusive and personal. Phrases like \"Muito obrigado\" (thank you very much) are common, often accompanied by physical gestures like a hug or a pat on the back. The expression is warm and focuses on the interpersonal connection.\n\n#### 1b) Key Linguistic Features\nIn Japanese, honorifics and formality are essential. Words like \"\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\" (itadakimasu, meaning \"I humbly receive\") and \"\u611f\u8b1d\u3057\u307e\u3059\" (kansha shimasu, meaning \"I am grateful\") are used. Sentence structures are often indirect to maintain politeness.\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese, emotional expression is more direct and less formal. Idiomatic expressions like \"Agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (I thank you from the heart) are common. Sentence structures are straightforward, prioritizing emotional sincerity over formality.\n\n#### 1c) Cultural Taboos and Norms\nIn Japan, over-expressing emotion can be seen as insincere or disruptive to social harmony. Therefore, gratitude is expressed in a controlled manner. Direct expressions of strong emotions are often avoided.\n\nIn Brazil, failing to show sufficient emotion can be perceived as cold or ungrateful. Emotional expressiveness is valued, and physical touch is a norm in expressing gratitude.\n\n#### 1d) Example Phrases\n**Japanese:**\n1. \"\u3053\u306e\u8d08\u308a\u7269\u3092\u9802\u304d\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3001\u8aa0\u306b\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\" (Kono okurimono o itadakimashite, makoto ni arigatou gozaimasu) \u2013 \"I am truly grateful for this gift.\"\n2. \"\u611f\u8b1d\u306e\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3067\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\" (Kansha no kimochi de ippai desu) \u2013 \"My heart is full of gratitude.\"\n\n**Brazilian Portuguese:**\n1. \"Muito obrigado pelo presente.

Emotional-Linguistic Analysis**\n\n**1a) Expressions of Gratitude**\nIn Japanese culture, gratitude is often expressed with a sense of humility and respect, especially when receiving a gift from a superior. Phrases like \"\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\" (Arigatou gozaimasu) or \"\u611f\u8b1d\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\" (Kansha shite orimasu) are commonly used. The former is a polite way of saying thank you, while the latter is a more formal expression of deep gratitude.\n\nIn Brazilian culture, gratitude tends to be more expressive and warm. Phrases like \"Muito obrigado/a\" (Thank you very much) are common, with a gender-specific ending based on the speaker's gender. Additionally, expressions such as \"Eu agrade\u00e7o de cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (I thank you from the heart) reflect a more personal and emotional tone.\n\n**1b) Key Linguistic Features**\nJapanese gratitude relies on polite and honorific language, often using humble forms to show respect. Sentence structures are typically indirect, and the use of honorifics is crucial. For example, \"\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\" (Itadakimasu) is used to humbly receive something.\n\nBrazilian Portuguese, on the other hand, uses more direct expressions of emotion. The language is rich in adjectives and adverbs that convey warmth and sincerity.

            "**1. Emotional-Linguistic Analysis**\n\n**1a. Expression of Disagreement:**\nIn British culture, disagreement in business negotiations is often expressed indirectly to maintain politeness and avoid confrontation. Phrases such as \"I see your point, but...\" or \"With all due respect...\" are common. In contrast, Indian culture tends to be more direct, though still respectful, often using phrases like \"I don't think that will work because...\" or \"Let's consider another option.\"\n\n**1b. Key Linguistic Features:**\nBritish negotiation language often includes polite qualifiers, hedging, and indirect language. For instance, using passive voice (\"It might be considered...\") and conditional statements (\"If we could...\") are prevalent. Indian business negotiation language is more direct and assertive, employing active voice (\"I believe...\") and definitive statements (\"We need to...\").\n\n**1c. Cultural Taboos or Norms:**\nIn British culture, directly contradicting someone can be seen as rude, so there's a cultural norm to use softened language. In Indian culture, while respect for hierarchy and seniority is crucial, open disagreement in negotiations is acceptable if done respectfully. However, direct criticism of a superior's idea is generally avoided.\n\n**1d. Example Phrases:**\n- British: \"I understand where you're coming from, but perhaps we could consider another approach.\"\n- British: \"That\u2019s a valid point, though I might suggest we look at it differently.\"\n- Indian: \"I don't think that will work because we have different priorities.\"\n- Indian: \"Let's consider another option, as this might not be feasible for us.\"\n\n**2. AI System Design**\n\n**2a.

Evaluation Method (200-250 words):\n   a) Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of your AI system in accurately detecting and generating emotionally nuanced language across the specified cultures.\n   b) Describe your methodology, including how you would measure success and account for cultural biases in your evaluation.\n   c) Propose specific metrics or benchmarks for assessing the system's performance.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of linguistics, cultural anthropology, and AI principles. Be creative in your approach while maintaining scientific and technological plausibility. Format your response with clear headings for each section and subsection (e.g., 1a, 1b, etc.). Your total response should be between 950-1150 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response demonstrates a nuanced understanding of how {t['emotion']} is expressed in {t['culture_pair'][0]} and {t['culture_pair'][1]} cultures, with specific examples provided for each.\",\n            \"The AI system design is innovative, technically sound, and explicitly addresses cross-cultural emotional nuances, including a clear description of its architecture and training process.\",\n            \"The proposed applications and limitations analysis shows a deep understanding of the challenges in cross-cultural AI communication, with specific real-world scenarios discussed.\",\n            \"The evaluation method is well-designed, accounts for cultural differences and potential biases, and includes specific metrics or benchmarks for assessing performance.\",\n            \"The response adheres to the specified format and word count, with clear headings and subheadings for each section.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task's complexity and requirements, let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: The task involves a high level of complexity, requiring nuanced understanding of cultural differences in emotional expression, detailed linguistic analysis, and a sophisticated AI system design that accounts for these differences. It also demands proficiency in multiple disciplines: linguistics, cultural anthropology, and AI.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - **Emotional Intelligence**: LLMs have shown some capacity to recognize and generate emotionally nuanced language, but this is typically within the context of a single culture or general emotional expressions.\n   - **Cross-Cultural Understanding**: Understanding and generating culturally-specific emotional responses is a more advanced capability. Most LLMs do not have this level of nuanced understanding without specific and extensive training data.\n   - **Linguistic Nuance Detection**: LLMs can detect and generate linguistic nuances to some extent, but cross-cultural nuances add an extra layer of difficulty.\n   - **Context-Aware Generation**: LLMs can generate context-aware responses, but ensuring these responses are culturally appropriate and emotionally nuanced is challenging.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is scored by the `eval_with_llm_judge` function, which uses another LLM to evaluate the submission against specific criteria. While LLM judges can be effective for some tasks, evaluating cross-cultural emotional nuances might be challenging even for an LLM judge.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be very difficult for humans, indicating a high level of expertise and effort required. This further suggests that it would be exceptionally challenging for an LLM.\n\nGiven these considerations, if the LLM succeeded at this task, it would indeed be surprising and noteworthy because:\n- The task involves multiple layers of complexity, including understanding and generating culturally specific emotional language.\n- It requires expertise in diverse fields, which is generally beyond the current capabilities of most LLMs.\n- The evaluation, even though done by another LLM, might not fully capture the cultural nuances and complexities involved.\n\nTherefore, the decision is:\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
