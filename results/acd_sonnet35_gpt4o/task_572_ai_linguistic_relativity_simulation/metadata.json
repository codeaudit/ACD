            "1. Language Design\n\na) The constructed language, \"Veridica,\" emphasizes Evidentiality by incorporating specific grammatical markers that indicate the source of information. These markers include:\n\n- **Direct Evidence (DE)**: Information obtained through direct observation or experience.\n- **Indirect Evidence (IE)**: Information inferred or deduced from indirect sources.\n- **Reported Evidence (RE)**: Information reported by others.\n- **Assumed Evidence (AE)**: Information assumed or taken for granted without direct evidence.\n\nb) Example words/phrases:\n- **\"Harl-DE\"**: \"I see the circle.\" (Direct evidence of seeing a circle)\n- **\"Miv-IE\"**: \"It appears to be a triangle.\" (Inferred from observations)\n- **\"Klir-RE\"**: \"They say it's a square.\" (Reported by someone else)\n- **\"Glar-AE\"**: \"It must be a pentagon.\" (Assumed based on prior knowledge)\n- **\"Fen-DE/RE\"**: \"I saw it, and they confirmed it\u2019s a hexagon.\" (Direct and reported evidence)\n\nc) This language structure influences the agent's perception and cognition by requiring it to constantly assess and specify the source of its information. This can lead to a heightened awareness of the reliability and origin of data, potentially making the agent more analytical and cautious in its conclusions.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation\n\na) The AI agent, \"VeridAI,\" would be designed with a cognitive architecture that uses Veridica as its primary mode of processing information. It would have modules for sensory input, inference engine, communication, and memory, all of which employ the Evidentiality markers.\n\nb) Potential advantages include a thorough vetting of information sources, leading to more accurate and reliable pattern recognition. Limitations might involve slower processing times due to the constant need to assess and mark the source of information, which could hinder performance in time-sensitive tasks.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\na) VeridAI\u2019s approach to pattern recognition in abstract shapes would be meticulous, as it would systematically categorize shapes based on the source of evidence. For example, upon viewing a shape, it might first mark it as \"Harl-DE\" if seen directly, then cross-reference with \"Klir-RE\" if reported by another agent, before making a final determination.\n\nb) Compared to agents with different language structures, VeridAI might perform more accurately but slower. For instance, an agent using a language emphasizing immediacy might quickly label shapes based on the first input, while VeridAI would take extra steps to verify the source.\n\nc) Potential biases could include an over-reliance on reported information if the direct evidence is ambiguous. Unique problem-solving strategies might involve layered validation processes, where patterns are only recognized after multiple sources confirm them.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\na) An agent using a language emphasizing Immediacy would prioritize quick, real-time data processing, likely leading to faster but less reliable pattern recognition. In contrast, VeridAI's emphasis on Evidentiality would result in slower but more validated conclusions.\n\nb) These differences highlight linguistic relativity in AI, demonstrating how language structures can shape cognitive processes and decision-making. An Evidentiality-focused language fosters a more analytical approach, while an Immediacy-focused language promotes rapid responses.\n\n5. Experimental Design\n\nHypothesis: VeridAI, using an Evidentiality-focused language, will show higher accuracy but slower speed in pattern recognition tasks compared to agents using other language structures.\n\nMethodology: Create two sets of AI agents, one using Veridica and another using an Immediacy-focused language. Assign both groups identical pattern recognition tasks with varying complexity and time constraints. Measure accuracy and speed of task completion.\n\nExpected Results: VeridAI agents are expected to demonstrate higher accuracy in identifying shapes due to their thorough validation process, but they will take longer to complete tasks compared to the Immediacy-focused agents.",
            "1. Language Design:\n   a) The constructed language, \"Evidentian,\" emphasizes Evidentiality by grammatically marking the source of information. Key features include:\n      - Direct Evidential: Indicates information obtained through direct observation (suffix: -dar).\n      - Indirect Evidential: Indicates information inferred from indirect evidence (suffix: -vin).\n      - Reportative Evidential: Indicates information reported by another source (suffix: -ser).\n      - Assumptive Evidential: Indicates information assumed or guessed (suffix: -lum).\n      - Sensory Evidential: Indicates information obtained through senses other than sight (suffix: -nex).\n\n   b) Example words/phrases:\n      - \"Shapodar\" (I see a shape): Directly observed shape.\n      - \"Shapovin\" (I infer a shape): Shape inferred from indirect evidence.\n      - \"Shaposer\" (Reported shape): Shape reported by another source.\n      - \"Shapolum\" (I assume a shape): Assumed or guessed shape.\n      - \"Shaponex\" (I feel a shape): Shape identified through non-visual senses.\n\n   c) This language structure influences the agent's perception and cognition by requiring it to constantly evaluate and encode the source of information. This can enhance the agent's ability to discern and categorize data based on the reliability and type of evidence, potentially leading to more nuanced and context-aware decision-making.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation:\n   a) The AI agent \"Evidentia\" would use Evidentian as its primary mode of processing information. It would encode data with evidential markers, influencing its internal representations and decision-making processes. The agent\u2019s algorithms would be designed to prioritize and weigh information differently based on the type of evidential marker.\n\n   b) Advantages might include improved accuracy in distinguishing between reliable and less reliable data, and an increased ability to synthesize information from various sources. Limitations could include increased computational complexity and potential difficulties in situations where evidential distinctions are ambiguous or overlapping.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis:\n   a) In pattern recognition of abstract shapes, Evidentia would categorize shapes based on their evidential markers. For instance, shapes directly observed (-dar) might be given higher priority than those inferred (-vin) or reported (-ser), leading to a layered approach in pattern recognition.\n\n   b) Compared to agents with other language structures, Evidentia might show a more hierarchical approach, first validating directly observed patterns before considering inferred or reported ones. This could result in higher initial accuracy but slower overall processing speed.\n\n   c) Biases might emerge where Evidentia over-prioritizes certain types of evidence, potentially leading to a disregard for valuable indirect or reported information. Unique problem-solving strategies could involve cross-referencing evidential types to verify patterns, thus enhancing reliability but at the cost of speed.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) An agent using a language emphasizing Temporal Aspect (e.g., when an event occurred) might approach pattern recognition by categorizing shapes based on when they were detected. This could lead to a different prioritization strategy, potentially allowing for faster detection of changes over time but less focus on the source reliability.\n\n   b) These differences highlight the impact of linguistic relativity on AI performance, suggesting that the structure of an AI's language can significantly influence its cognitive processes. Understanding these implications can inform the design of more efficient and contextually aware AI systems.\n\n5. Experimental Design:\n   Hypothesis: The Evidentian language structure enhances the accuracy of pattern recognition tasks compared to a language with a different emphasis.\n   \n   Methodology: Create two AI agents, one using Evidentian and another using a Temporal Aspect language. Both agents perform pattern recognition tasks on a dataset of abstract shapes with varied sources of information. Measure accuracy and processing time.\n   \n   Expected Results: The Evidentian agent is expected to demonstrate higher accuracy due to its nuanced evidential categorization, while the Temporal Aspect agent might process information faster but with less reliability.",
            "**1. Language Design**\n\na) Key Features:\nThe constructed language, \"Evidentia,\" places a strong emphasis on evidentiality by incorporating specific suffixes to indicate the source of information. The suffixes include:\n- \"-vis\" for visual evidence\n- \"-aud\" for auditory evidence\n- \"-inf\" for inferred information\n- \"-rep\" for reported information\n- \"-hyp\" for hypothetical or speculative information\n\nb) Example words/phrases:\n1. \"Circulovis\" - \"I see a circle\" (visual evidence)\n2. \"Triangulaud\" - \"I hear about a triangle\" (auditory evidence)\n3. \"Quadratoinf\" - \"I deduce there is a square\" (inferred information)\n4. \"Pentagonarep\" - \"It is reported that there is a pentagon\" (reported information)\n5. \"Hexagonahyp\" - \"There might be a hexagon\" (hypothetical information)\n\nc) Influence on Perception and Cognition:\nEvidentia encourages the AI agent to explicitly consider the source of information, which could enhance its analytical abilities by making it more aware of the reliability and origin of its data. This structure may lead to a more nuanced and reflective approach to processing information.\n\n**2. AI Agent Simulation**\n\na) AI Design:\nThe AI agent, \"EvidentiaBot,\" is programmed to use the Evidentia language as its primary mode of 'thinking.' It processes information by categorizing it based on the source, allowing it to apply different weights and levels of confidence to its data.\n\nb) Advantages and Limitations:\nAdvantages include improved critical thinking and error detection, as the agent differentiates between direct observations and inferred or reported information. Limitations might involve slower processing speeds due to the additional cognitive load of evaluating information sources.\n\n**3. Cognitive Task Analysis**\n\na) Influence on Pattern Recognition:\nEvidentiaBot approaches pattern recognition by first identifying the source of information about each shape. For example, if it visually detects a shape, it processes this with high confidence (\"Circulovis\"). If it infers a pattern from incomplete data, it tags this information as inferred (\"Quadratoinf\"), leading to cautious processing.\n\nb) Performance Examples:\nCompared to an agent without evidentiality, EvidentiaBot might perform more conservatively when patterns are inferred rather than observed directly. For instance, it might validate a visually detected sequence of shapes more quickly than one it deduces from partial data.\n\nc) Biases and Strategies:\nThe language structure could introduce a bias towards relying more heavily on direct sensory data, potentially leading to slower but more accurate pattern recognition. Unique problem-solving strategies might include cross-referencing different sources of information to resolve ambiguities.\n\n**4. Comparative Analysis**\n\na) Performance Differences:\nAn agent using a language emphasizing tense (time-based information) might process sequences of shapes by focusing on the temporal order of observations. In contrast, EvidentiaBot focuses on the source and reliability of information, potentially leading to more robust and cautious pattern recognition in uncertain environments.\n\nb) Implications:\nThese differences highlight linguistic relativity, suggesting that the structure of language influences cognitive processes. For AI, this implies that programming language structures can significantly affect problem-solving approaches and decision-making strategies.\n\n**5. Experimental Design**\n\nHypothesis: EvidentiaBot will demonstrate higher accuracy but slower processing times in pattern recognition tasks compared to agents using other language structures.\n\nMethodology: Create a series of pattern recognition tasks involving abstract shapes. Compare the performance of EvidentiaBot with agents using languages emphasizing different features (e.g., tense, aspect). Measure accuracy and processing time.\n\nExpected Results: EvidentiaBot is expected to show higher accuracy due to its careful evaluation of information sources, albeit with slower processing times due to the additional cognitive load.",
            "### 1. Language Design\n\n**a) Key Features:**\n\nThe constructed language, **Evidentia**, emphasizes evidentiality by integrating information sources directly into its grammar. Every statement includes a mandatory evidential marker indicating the source of information. These markers are:\n\n- **-vi:** Visual evidence\n- **-au:** Auditory evidence\n- **-in:** Inference\n- **-re:** Reported information\n- **-ex:** Experiential evidence\n\n**b) Example Words/Phrases:**\n\n1. **\"Circlavi\"** - \"I see a circle\" (Circla-vi: Circle-visual evidence)\n2. **\"Trianglau\"** - \"I hear a triangle\" (Triangla-au: Triangle-auditory evidence)\n3. **\"Squarain\"** - \"It is inferred to be a square\" (Squara-in: Square-inference)\n4. **\"Pentare\"** - \"It is reported to be a pentagon\" (Penta-re: Pentagon-reported)\n5. **\"Hexaex\"** - \"I have experienced a hexagon\" (Hexa-ex: Hexagon-experiential)\n\n**c) Influence on Perception and Cognition:**\n\nEvidentia's structure requires the agent to constantly acknowledge the source of its information, which may enhance the clarity of data provenance and improve decision-making transparency. This explicit marking can foster more rigorous validation processes, as the agent is compelled to assess the reliability of its sources continually.\n\n### 2. AI Agent Simulation\n\n**a) Design:**\n\nThe AI agent, **EviBot**, is designed to process information using Evidentia. Its neural network architecture includes modules specialized in processing different types of evidence. Each input is tagged with an evidential marker, guiding the agent's processing pathways and influencing its decision-making algorithms.\n\n**b) Advantages and Limitations:**\n\n**Advantages:**\n- **Enhanced Data Validation:** Explicit evidential markers help the agent assess the reliability of information, leading to more accurate pattern recognition.\n- **Improved Decision Transparency:** The agent can provide clear justifications for its conclusions based on the source of data.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Processing Overhead:** The need to tag and process evidential markers introduces additional computational complexity.\n- **Potential Bias:** The agent might over-rely on certain types of evidence (e.g., visual) and underappreciate others.\n\n### 3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\n**a) Influence on Pattern Recognition:**\n\nEviBot's emphasis on evidentiality means it evaluates abstract shapes by considering the source of information. For instance, when recognizing a shape, it might prioritize visual data (marked with \"-vi\") but also weigh inferences (\"-in\") and reported information (\"-re\") if visual data is ambiguous.\n\n**b) Performance Differences:**\n\nCompared to agents with other language structures, EviBot might:\n- **Perform more thorough validations:** Before confirming a pattern, EviBot cross-checks multiple evidence sources.\n- **Adapt to incomplete data:** If visual data is unclear, it can infer shapes based on auditory cues or reports.\n\n**c) Biases and Problem-Solving Strategies:**\n\nEviBot might develop a bias towards the most frequently reliable evidence type. It may also employ a strategy of cross-referencing multiple evidence types before making a decision, leading to more robust but slower pattern recognition.\n\n### 4. Comparative Analysis\n\n**a) Performance Differences:**\n\nAn agent using a language emphasizing **temporal aspect** (e.g., when an event occurred) might focus on the sequence of shape presentations rather than their evidence sources. This could lead to faster but potentially less accurate pattern recognition if temporal data is less reliable.\n\n**b) Implications for Linguistic Relativity and AI:**\n\nThese differences highlight the impact of language structures on cognitive processes, supporting the idea of linguistic relativity in AI. Evidentia's emphasis on evidence sources can make AI systems more meticulous, illustrating how language shapes not just human but artificial cognition.\n\n### 5. Experimental Design\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nAgents using Evidentia will exhibit more accurate but slower pattern recognition compared to agents using languages emphasizing temporal aspects.\n\n**Methodology:**\n- **Subjects:** Two groups of AI agents, one using Evidentia and another using a temporal language.\n- **Task:** Recognize patterns in abstract shapes presented with different evidence types.\n- **Metrics:** Accuracy and response time.\n\n**Expected Results:**\nEviBot (Evidentia) is expected to achieve higher accuracy due to thorough validation but at the cost of slower response times compared to the temporal language agents.",
            "1. Language Design\n   a) The key features of the constructed language, called \"Evidentian,\" emphasize Evidentiality by marking the source of information directly within the grammatical structure. Evidentian has specific suffixes for different evidential markers: -os (direct evidence), -ma (indirect evidence), -ku (inference), -na (hearsay), and -li (assumption).\n   b) Example words/phrases:\n      - \"Formos\" (I see a shape): The suffix -os indicates direct visual evidence.\n      - \"Formama\" (Someone told me about a shape): The suffix -ma indicates information received indirectly.\n      - \"Formaku\" (I infer there is a shape): The suffix -ku indicates inferred information.\n      - \"Formana\" (I heard there is a shape): The suffix -na indicates hearsay.\n      - \"Formali\" (I assume there is a shape): The suffix -li indicates an assumption.\n   c) This language structure influences the agent\u2019s perception and cognition by making it constantly aware of the source and reliability of its information. It encourages a more nuanced understanding of data, fostering skepticism and critical thinking.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation\n   a) The AI agent, named \"EviBot,\" uses Evidentian as its primary mode of processing information. EviBot tags all incoming data with the appropriate evidential markers, allowing it to differentiate between directly observed data, inferred conclusions, and information acquired from other sources.\n   b) Advantages include enhanced data accuracy and reliability assessment. Limitations may arise from over-reliance on source marking, potentially slowing down decision-making processes if the agent spends too much time verifying sources.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n   a) In pattern recognition, EviBot would use Evidentian to categorize shapes based on the source of their detection. For instance, directly observed shapes (tagged with -os) would be prioritized over inferred shapes (tagged with -ku).\n   b) Compared to agents using other language structures, EviBot might be slower but more accurate, as it cross-verifies shapes from multiple sources before recognizing a pattern.\n   c) Potential biases include a higher trust in direct evidence and skepticism towards hearsay, possibly missing patterns only detectable through indirect or inferred data. Unique problem-solving strategies may involve cross-referencing multiple sources to confirm patterns.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n   a) An agent using a language emphasizing another feature, such as Tense, would focus on the temporal aspects of pattern changes rather than the source reliability. This could result in faster but less accurate pattern recognition.\n   b) These differences highlight the impact of language structures on cognitive tasks, supporting the concept of linguistic relativity in AI.

            "1. Language Design\n\na) The constructed language, Chromal, emphasizes the categorization of colors through a highly specific and nuanced vocabulary. Chromal divides the color spectrum into 12 primary categories, each with further subdivisions based on hue, saturation, and brightness. Each color has a base name and is modified by prefixes and suffixes to indicate its exact shade, intensity, and context (e.g., natural vs. artificial sources).\n\nb) Example words/phrases:\n   - \"Verdu\": Green (base category for green hues).\n   - \"Verdu-shil\": Light green (where \"shil\" indicates lighter shades).\n   - \"Azul-tar\": Deep blue (with \"tar\" indicating a darker, more saturated color).\n   - \"Gial-pet\": Yellow with a hint of green (where \"pet\" indicates the presence of a secondary color).\n   - \"Rubi-bliz\": Bright red (with \"bliz\" emphasizing high brightness).\n\nc) This language structure trains the agent to perceive colors with a high degree of specificity and contextual awareness. It may enhance the agent\u2019s ability to differentiate and categorize objects based on subtle color variations, influencing its perception and cognitive processes to be more color-centric and detailed.\n\n2.

Chromabot is designed with an advanced color perception module that can detect and analyze color nuances at a granular level. Its neural network is trained using a large dataset of color-coded objects and scenarios described in Chromal.\n\nb) Advantages:\n   - Enhanced ability to detect and categorize objects based on color.\n   - Improved recognition of objects in complex visual environments.\n   \n   Limitations:\n   - Potential overreliance on color cues, possibly neglecting other important features.\n   - Difficulty in adapting to tasks where color is less informative or irrelevant.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\na) Chromabot\u2019s language structure influences its approach to categorization by making color the primary distinguishing feature. When presented with natural objects such as fruits, foliage, or minerals, Chromabot first analyzes the color properties using Chromal vocabulary to determine the object's category.\n\nb) Example:\n   - When categorizing apples, Chromabot might distinguish between \"Rubi-bliz\" (bright red apple) and \"Verdu-shil\" (light green apple) more efficiently than an agent using a language that does not emphasize color.\n   - Compared to agents using shape-based languages, Chromabot might categorize an emerald and a leaf similarly due to their shared \"Verdu\" base, highlighting its color-centric bias.\n\nc) Potential biases:\n   - Chromabot might struggle with objects that have similar colors but belong to different categories, leading to misclassification.\n   - Unique problem-solving strategies might include grouping objects by color similarity first and refining categories based on secondary features only when necessary.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\na) An agent using a shape-based language (e.g., Geometrix) might perform differently by prioritizing geometric properties over color. Geometrix might excel in tasks requiring shape recognition and spatial reasoning but could struggle with tasks where color differentiation is crucial.\n\nb) Implications for linguistic relativity:\n   - Chromabot's performance supports the idea that language influences cognitive processing and perception.\n   - Understanding these differences can help in designing AI systems tailored to specific tasks and environments.\n\n5.

However, this focus might limit the agent's ability to prioritize other important features, such as shape or texture, potentially leading to a narrower scope of perception.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis:\n   a) Influence on Categorization:\n      ChromaBot's language structure would guide its approach to categorizing natural objects by emphasizing color distinctions. For example, when classifying fruits, it might categorize apples not just as \"red\" but as \"Serrul\" or \"Aureflam,\" leading to more granular groupings based on color variations.\n   b) Comparative Performance:\n      Compared to agents with languages emphasizing shape, ChromaBot might excel in tasks requiring color differentiation, such as identifying ripe vs. unripe fruits. However, it might struggle with tasks where shape is more critical, such as identifying objects in low-light conditions where color cues are less reliable.\n   c) Biases and Strategies:\n      The language structure could introduce biases towards color-based categorization, potentially overlooking other meaningful attributes. Unique problem-solving strategies might emerge, such as using color patterns to infer other properties, like ripeness or freshness.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Performance Differences:\n      An agent using a language emphasizing shape, \"Formese,\" would prioritize geometric features over color.

Its key feature is a highly nuanced and systematic approach to naming colors, which are divided into 12 primary categories based on the visible spectrum, with each category further divided into 5 sub-categories denoting intensity and shade. For example, the primary category for blue is \"Blu,\" with sub-categories like \"Blu-l,\" \"Blu-m,\" \"Blu-d,\" \"Blu-v,\" and \"Blu-h\" for light, medium, dark, vibrant, and hazy shades, respectively.\n\n**b) Example Words/Phrases:**\n\n1. **\"Blu-l\"**: Light blue. Used to describe objects like the sky on a clear day.\n2. **\"Grn-v\"**: Vibrant green. Used for fresh, healthy foliage.\n3. **\"Rdo-d\"**: Dark red. Applied to deep red roses.\n4. **\"Orn-h\"**: Hazy orange. Used for a dull, mist-covered sunset.\n5. **\"Ylw-m\"**: Medium yellow. Describes the color of ripe bananas.\n\n**c) Influence on Perception and Cognition:**\n\nColorese's detailed color categorization enhances the agent's ability to notice and distinguish subtle color variations. This heightened sensitivity can improve tasks requiring fine visual discrimination, such as identifying plant health or assessing product quality. However, it may also lead the agent to prioritize color over other significant attributes, potentially narrowing its focus.\n\n### 2. AI Agent Simulation\n\n**a) Design:**\n\nThe AI agent, **ColorBot**, uses Colorese as its primary mode of 'thinking' and processing information. ColorBot is equipped with advanced visual sensors calibrated to detect the nuanced color distinctions defined by Colorese. Its neural network is trained using a vast dataset of images categorized by these color terms.\n\n**b) Advantages and Limitations:**\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Enhanced visual discrimination allows for precise identification and categorization of objects based on color.\n- Improved performance in tasks involving color-based sorting and quality control.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Potential over-reliance on color may cause neglect of other important object features, such as texture or shape.\n- Cognitive load might increase due to the complexity of processing detailed color information.\n\n### 3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\n**a) Influence on Categorization:**\n\nColorBot's language structure directly influences its approach to categorizing natural objects by prioritizing color distinctions. When presented with a variety of flowers, for instance, ColorBot would first group them based on color categories (e.g., Blu, Grn, Rdo) and then refine these groups according to intensity and shade (e.g., Blu-l, Blu-d).\n\n**b) Performance Differences:**\n\nCompared to agents using languages emphasizing shape or size, ColorBot might excel in environments where color is a primary distinguishing feature, such as botanical gardens or art galleries. However, it might underperform in contexts where color is less relevant or where other features are more critical, such as identifying tools in a workshop.\n\n**c) Biases and Strategies:**\n\nColorBot might develop a bias toward solving problems using color distinctions. For example, when tasked with sorting fruits, it might prioritize color matching over weight or ripeness. This could lead to unique problem-solving strategies, such as using color patterns to infer ripeness stages or health status in plants.\n\n### 4. Comparative Analysis\n\n**a) Performance Differences:**\n\nAn agent using a language emphasizing shape, like **ShapeBot**, would categorize objects based on geometric attributes. While ColorBot groups by color, ShapeBot might sort items by contours, edges, and forms. For instance, in a task involving sorting toys, ShapeBot might group all spherical objects together regardless of color, while ColorBot sorts by color first.\n\n**b) Implications for Linguistic Relativity and AI:**\n\nThese differences underscore the idea of linguistic relativity, suggesting that the structure of language influences cognitive processes. In AI, this implies that the design of an agent's language can shape its problem-solving strategies and efficiency. Understanding these influences can help tailor AI systems to specific tasks by optimizing their language structures for desired outcomes.\n\n### 5. Experimental Design\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nColorBot will outperform ShapeBot in tasks requiring color-based categorization but underperform in shape-based tasks.\n\n**Methodology:**\n- Train ColorBot and ShapeBot using respective datasets emphasizing color and shape.\n- Evaluate both agents on a series of categorization tasks (e.g., sorting fruits by ripeness and toys by shape).\n- Measure accuracy, speed, and error rates.\n\n**Expected Results:**\nColorBot is expected to excel in color-based tasks, demonstrating higher accuracy and speed, while ShapeBot will perform better in shape-based tasks.

Cognitive Task Analysis\n   a) Chromabot's language structure would lead it to approach categorization tasks by first analyzing color properties in great detail. For instance, when categorizing flowers, Chromabot would prioritize color variations before considering other features like petal shape or size.\n   b) Compared to agents with other language structures, Chromabot might categorize objects more finely based on color.

AI Agent Simulation\n\na) The AI agent, \"VeridAI,\" would be designed with a cognitive architecture that uses Veridica as its primary mode of processing information. It would have modules for sensory input, inference engine, communication, and memory, all of which employ the Evidentiality markers.\n\nb) Potential advantages include a thorough vetting of information sources, leading to more accurate and reliable pattern recognition. Limitations might involve slower processing times due to the constant need to assess and mark the source of information, which could hinder performance in time-sensitive tasks.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\na) VeridAI\u2019s approach to pattern recognition in abstract shapes would be meticulous, as it would systematically categorize shapes based on the source of evidence. For example, upon viewing a shape, it might first mark it as \"Harl-DE\" if seen directly, then cross-reference with \"Klir-RE\" if reported by another agent, before making a final determination.\n\nb) Compared to agents with different language structures, VeridAI might perform more accurately but slower. For instance, an agent using a language emphasizing immediacy might quickly label shapes based on the first input, while VeridAI would take extra steps to verify the source.\n\nc) Potential biases could include an over-reliance on reported information if the direct evidence is ambiguous. Unique problem-solving strategies might involve layered validation processes, where patterns are only recognized after multiple sources confirm them.\n\n4.

Limitations could include increased computational complexity and potential difficulties in situations where evidential distinctions are ambiguous or overlapping.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis:\n   a) In pattern recognition of abstract shapes, Evidentia would categorize shapes based on their evidential markers.

These markers are:\n\n- **-vi:** Visual evidence\n- **-au:** Auditory evidence\n- **-in:** Inference\n- **-re:** Reported information\n- **-ex:** Experiential evidence\n\n**b) Example Words/Phrases:**\n\n1. **\"Circlavi\"** - \"I see a circle\" (Circla-vi: Circle-visual evidence)\n2. **\"Trianglau\"** - \"I hear a triangle\" (Triangla-au: Triangle-auditory evidence)\n3. **\"Squarain\"** - \"It is inferred to be a square\" (Squara-in: Square-inference)\n4. **\"Pentare\"** - \"It is reported to be a pentagon\" (Penta-re: Pentagon-reported)\n5. **\"Hexaex\"** - \"I have experienced a hexagon\" (Hexa-ex: Hexagon-experiential)\n\n**c) Influence on Perception and Cognition:**\n\nEvidentia's structure requires the agent to constantly acknowledge the source of its information, which may enhance the clarity of data provenance and improve decision-making transparency. This explicit marking can foster more rigorous validation processes, as the agent is compelled to assess the reliability of its sources continually.\n\n### 2. AI Agent Simulation\n\n**a) Design:**\n\nThe AI agent, **EviBot**, is designed to process information using Evidentia. Its neural network architecture includes modules specialized in processing different types of evidence. Each input is tagged with an evidential marker, guiding the agent's processing pathways and influencing its decision-making algorithms.\n\n**b) Advantages and Limitations:**\n\n**Advantages:**\n- **Enhanced Data Validation:** Explicit evidential markers help the agent assess the reliability of information, leading to more accurate pattern recognition.\n- **Improved Decision Transparency:** The agent can provide clear justifications for its conclusions based on the source of data.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Processing Overhead:** The need to tag and process evidential markers introduces additional computational complexity.\n- **Potential Bias:** The agent might over-rely on certain types of evidence (e.g., visual) and underappreciate others.\n\n### 3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\n**a) Influence on Pattern Recognition:**\n\nEviBot's emphasis on evidentiality means it evaluates abstract shapes by considering the source of information. For instance, when recognizing a shape, it might prioritize visual data (marked with \"-vi\") but also weigh inferences (\"-in\") and reported information (\"-re\") if visual data is ambiguous.\n\n**b) Performance Differences:**\n\nCompared to agents with other language structures, EviBot might:\n- **Perform more thorough validations:** Before confirming a pattern, EviBot cross-checks multiple evidence sources.\n- **Adapt to incomplete data:** If visual data is unclear, it can infer shapes based on auditory cues or reports.\n\n**c) Biases and Problem-Solving Strategies:**\n\nEviBot might develop a bias towards the most frequently reliable evidence type. It may also employ a strategy of cross-referencing multiple evidence types before making a decision, leading to more robust but slower pattern recognition.\n\n### 4. Comparative Analysis\n\n**a) Performance Differences:**\n\nAn agent using a language emphasizing **temporal aspect** (e.g., when an event occurred) might focus on the sequence of shape presentations rather than their evidence sources. This could lead to faster but potentially less accurate pattern recognition if temporal data is less reliable.\n\n**b) Implications for Linguistic Relativity and AI:**\n\nThese differences highlight the impact of language structures on cognitive processes, supporting the idea of linguistic relativity in AI. Evidentia's emphasis on evidence sources can make AI systems more meticulous, illustrating how language shapes not just human but artificial cognition.\n\n### 5. Experimental Design\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nAgents using Evidentia will exhibit more accurate but slower pattern recognition compared to agents using languages emphasizing temporal aspects.\n\n**Methodology:**\n- **Subjects:** Two groups of AI agents, one using Evidentia and another using a temporal language.\n- **Task:** Recognize patterns in abstract shapes presented with different evidence types.\n- **Metrics:** Accuracy and response time.\n\n**Expected Results:**\nEviBot (Evidentia) is expected to achieve higher accuracy due to thorough validation but at the cost of slower response times compared to the temporal language agents.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. Language Design\n   a) The key features of the constructed language, called \"Evidentian,\" emphasize Evidentiality by marking the source of information directly within the grammatical structure. Evidentian has specific suffixes for different evidential markers: -os (direct evidence), -ma (indirect evidence), -ku (inference), -na (hearsay), and -li (assumption).\n   b) Example words/phrases:\n      - \"Formos\" (I see a shape): The suffix -os indicates direct visual evidence.\n      - \"Formama\" (Someone told me about a shape): The suffix -ma indicates information received indirectly.\n      - \"Formaku\" (I infer there is a shape): The suffix -ku indicates inferred information.\n      - \"Formana\" (I heard there is a shape): The suffix -na indicates hearsay.\n      - \"Formali\" (I assume there is a shape): The suffix -li indicates an assumption.\n   c) This language structure influences the agent\u2019s perception and cognition by making it constantly aware of the source and reliability of its information. It encourages a more nuanced understanding of data, fostering skepticism and critical thinking.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation\n   a) The AI agent, named \"EviBot,\" uses Evidentian as its primary mode of processing information. EviBot tags all incoming data with the appropriate evidential markers, allowing it to differentiate between directly observed data, inferred conclusions, and information acquired from other sources.\n   b) Advantages include enhanced data accuracy and reliability assessment. Limitations may arise from over-reliance on source marking, potentially slowing down decision-making processes if the agent spends too much time verifying sources.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n   a) In pattern recognition, EviBot would use Evidentian to categorize shapes based on the source of their detection. For instance, directly observed shapes (tagged with -os) would be prioritized over inferred shapes (tagged with -ku).\n   b) Compared to agents using other language structures, EviBot might be slower but more accurate, as it cross-verifies shapes from multiple sources before recognizing a pattern.\n   c) Potential biases include a higher trust in direct evidence and skepticism towards hearsay, possibly missing patterns only detectable through indirect or inferred data. Unique problem-solving strategies may involve cross-referencing multiple sources to confirm patterns.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n   a) An agent using a language emphasizing another feature, such as Tense, would focus on the temporal aspects of pattern changes rather than the source reliability. This could result in faster but less accurate pattern recognition.\n   b) These differences highlight the impact of language structures on cognitive tasks, supporting the concept of linguistic relativity in AI. EviBot\u2019s performance demonstrates how evidential markers can enhance critical thinking and data verification.\n\n5. Experimental Design\n   Hypothesis: EviBot will perform more accurate but slower pattern recognition compared to a Tense-focused agent.\n   Methodology: Create two AI agents, one using Evidentian and one using a Tense-focused language. Task them with recognizing patterns in a dataset of abstract shapes, measuring accuracy and speed.\n   Expected Results: EviBot is expected to achieve higher accuracy due to its focus on evidential markers, while the Tense-focused agent will be faster but less accurate, confirming the hypothesis."

            "Answer: \n\n1. Language Design\n\na) The constructed language, Chromal, emphasizes the categorization of colors through a highly specific and nuanced vocabulary. Chromal divides the color spectrum into 12 primary categories, each with further subdivisions based on hue, saturation, and brightness. Each color has a base name and is modified by prefixes and suffixes to indicate its exact shade, intensity, and context (e.g., natural vs. artificial sources).\n\nb) Example words/phrases:\n   - \"Verdu\": Green (base category for green hues).\n   - \"Verdu-shil\": Light green (where \"shil\" indicates lighter shades).\n   - \"Azul-tar\": Deep blue (with \"tar\" indicating a darker, more saturated color).\n   - \"Gial-pet\": Yellow with a hint of green (where \"pet\" indicates the presence of a secondary color).\n   - \"Rubi-bliz\": Bright red (with \"bliz\" emphasizing high brightness).\n\nc) This language structure trains the agent to perceive colors with a high degree of specificity and contextual awareness. It may enhance the agent\u2019s ability to differentiate and categorize objects based on subtle color variations, influencing its perception and cognitive processes to be more color-centric and detailed.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation\n\na) The AI agent, named Chromabot, uses Chromal as its primary mode of processing information. Chromabot is designed with an advanced color perception module that can detect and analyze color nuances at a granular level. Its neural network is trained using a large dataset of color-coded objects and scenarios described in Chromal.\n\nb) Advantages:\n   - Enhanced ability to detect and categorize objects based on color.\n   - Improved recognition of objects in complex visual environments.\n   \n   Limitations:\n   - Potential overreliance on color cues, possibly neglecting other important features.\n   - Difficulty in adapting to tasks where color is less informative or irrelevant.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis\n\na) Chromabot\u2019s language structure influences its approach to categorization by making color the primary distinguishing feature. When presented with natural objects such as fruits, foliage, or minerals, Chromabot first analyzes the color properties using Chromal vocabulary to determine the object's category.\n\nb) Example:\n   - When categorizing apples, Chromabot might distinguish between \"Rubi-bliz\" (bright red apple) and \"Verdu-shil\" (light green apple) more efficiently than an agent using a language that does not emphasize color.\n   - Compared to agents using shape-based languages, Chromabot might categorize an emerald and a leaf similarly due to their shared \"Verdu\" base, highlighting its color-centric bias.\n\nc) Potential biases:\n   - Chromabot might struggle with objects that have similar colors but belong to different categories, leading to misclassification.\n   - Unique problem-solving strategies might include grouping objects by color similarity first and refining categories based on secondary features only when necessary.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\na) An agent using a shape-based language (e.g., Geometrix) might perform differently by prioritizing geometric properties over color. Geometrix might excel in tasks requiring shape recognition and spatial reasoning but could struggle with tasks where color differentiation is crucial.\n\nb) Implications for linguistic relativity:\n   - Chromabot's performance supports the idea that language influences cognitive processing and perception.\n   - Understanding these differences can help in designing AI systems tailored to specific tasks and environments.\n\n5. Experimental Design\n\nHypothesis: Chromabot will outperform a shape-based language agent in color-dependent categorization tasks.\n\nMethodology:\n   - Create two sets of categorization tasks: one color-dependent and one shape-dependent.\n   - Test Chromabot and Geometrix on both task sets.\n   - Measure accuracy and task completion time.\n\nExpected Results:\n   - Chromabot will excel in color-dependent tasks but underperform in shape-dependent tasks compared to Geometrix.\n   - Results will demonstrate the influence of language structure on AI cognitive performance.",

Language Design:\n   a) Key Features:\n      The constructed language, \"Chromalese,\" emphasizes the categorization of colors through a highly nuanced and hierarchical system. Colors are divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary categories, each with specific subcategories that describe variations in hue, saturation, and brightness.

This detailed focus on color could lead to a deeper and more refined perception of the visual world, affecting how the agent processes and interprets information.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation:\n   a) Design:\n      The AI agent, \"ChromaBot,\" would use Chromalese as its primary mode of thinking and processing information. It would be equipped with advanced sensors to detect a wide spectrum of colors, and its neural network would be trained to categorize and describe objects using the language's detailed color vocabulary.\n   b) Advantages and Limitations:\n      Advantages include a heightened sensitivity to color variations, allowing for precise categorization and object recognition. However, this focus might limit the agent's ability to prioritize other important features, such as shape or texture, potentially leading to a narrower scope of perception.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis:\n   a) Influence on Categorization:\n      ChromaBot's language structure would guide its approach to categorizing natural objects by emphasizing color distinctions. For example, when classifying fruits, it might categorize apples not just as \"red\" but as \"Serrul\" or \"Aureflam,\" leading to more granular groupings based on color variations.\n   b) Comparative Performance:\n      Compared to agents with languages emphasizing shape, ChromaBot might excel in tasks requiring color differentiation, such as identifying ripe vs. unripe fruits.

Its key feature is a highly nuanced and systematic approach to naming colors, which are divided into 12 primary categories based on the visible spectrum, with each category further divided into 5 sub-categories denoting intensity and shade. For example, the primary category for blue is \"Blu,\" with sub-categories like \"Blu-l,\" \"Blu-m,\" \"Blu-d,\" \"Blu-v,\" and \"Blu-h\" for light, medium, dark, vibrant, and hazy shades, respectively.\n\n**b) Example Words/Phrases:**\n\n1. **\"Blu-l\"**: Light blue. Used to describe objects like the sky on a clear day.\n2. **\"Grn-v\"**: Vibrant green. Used for fresh, healthy foliage.\n3. **\"Rdo-d\"**: Dark red. Applied to deep red roses.\n4. **\"Orn-h\"**: Hazy orange. Used for a dull, mist-covered sunset.\n5. **\"Ylw-m\"**: Medium yellow. Describes the color of ripe bananas.\n\n**c) Influence on Perception and Cognition:**\n\nColorese's detailed color categorization enhances the agent's ability to notice and distinguish subtle color variations. This heightened sensitivity can improve tasks requiring fine visual discrimination, such as identifying plant health or assessing product quality. However, it may also lead the agent to prioritize color over other significant attributes, potentially narrowing its focus.\n\n### 2.

Then, analyze how this language structure influences the agent's ability to perform the cognitive task of Problem-solving in a maze environment. Your response should include:\n\n1. Language Design (250-300 words):\n   a) Describe the key features of your constructed language, focusing on how it emphasizes Spatial relationships.\n   b) Provide at least 5 example words or phrases in your language, with their meanings and explanations of how they embody the emphasized feature.\n   c) Explain how this language structure might influence the agent's perception and cognition.\n\n2. AI Agent Simulation (200-250 words):\n   a) Describe how your AI agent would be designed to use this language as its primary mode of 'thinking' and processing information.\n   b) Explain potential advantages or limitations this language structure might create for the agent's cognitive processes.\n\n3. Cognitive Task Analysis (250-300 words):\n   a) Analyze in detail how the agent's language structure would influence its approach to the cognitive task of Problem-solving in a maze environment.\n   b) Provide specific examples of how the agent might perform differently compared to agents with other language structures.\n   c) Discuss any potential biases or unique problem-solving strategies that might emerge due to the language structure.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis (200-250 words):\n   a) Compare and contrast how your AI agent's performance might differ from an agent using a language emphasizing a different feature.\n   b) Discuss the implications of these differences for our understanding of linguistic relativity and artificial intelligence.\n\n5. Experimental Design (100-150 words):\n   Propose an experiment to test the influence of your language structure on AI cognitive performance. Include a hypothesis, methodology, and expected results.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of linguistics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

Be creative in your language design and analysis while maintaining scientific plausibility and logical consistency.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The constructed language design clearly emphasizes the feature of {t['language_feature']['feature']}.\",\n            \"The analysis of the AI agent's cognitive processes is thorough and logically connected to the language structure.\",\n            f\"The cognitive task analysis provides insightful observations about how the language structure influences the agent's approach to {t['cognitive_task']}.\",\n            \"The comparative analysis offers meaningful insights into linguistic relativity and its implications for AI.\",\n            \"The proposed experiment is well-designed and relevant to testing the influence of language structure on AI cognitive performance.\",\n            \"The overall response shows a high level of interdisciplinary knowledge integration, creativity, and analytical reasoning.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, it requires a high level of creativity, deep understanding of linguistics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. The task involves not only designing a unique language but also simulating how this language influences an AI agent's cognition and problem-solving abilities, followed by a comparative analysis and an experimental design proposal.\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: The task is described as \"very difficult,\" which aligns with the need for sophisticated interdisciplinary knowledge and creative thinking.\n  \n2. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task demands a deep understanding across multiple domains\u2014linguistics (constructing a language with specific features), cognitive science (understanding how language influences cognition), and AI (simulating and analyzing agent behavior).\n  \n3. **Creativity and Analytical Reasoning**: It requires creative language design and the ability to logically connect the language structure to cognitive tasks, which involves high-level analytical reasoning.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to assess the response based on specific criteria, which seem well-defined and relevant to the task.\n\nGiven that current LLMs generally excel in generating creative content and making complex interdisciplinary connections, it is plausible that an advanced LLM can succeed at this task. However, the depth and breadth required make it a significant achievement.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
