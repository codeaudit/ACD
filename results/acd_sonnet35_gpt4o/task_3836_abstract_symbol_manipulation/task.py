Your task is to analyze these symbols, infer potential rules or patterns governing their relationships, and then use them to perform the operation: {t['operation']}. The operation should be interpreted as a way to manipulate or arrange the symbols based on your inferred rules.

1. Symbol Analysis (100-150 words):
   Describe any patterns, relationships, or properties you observe in the given set of symbols. Consider aspects such as shape, complexity, symmetry, or any other relevant characteristics.

2. Rule Inference (150-200 words):
   Based on your analysis, propose a set of rules that could govern the relationships between these symbols. Your rules should be logical, consistent, and applicable to all symbols in the set. Include at least three distinct rules.
   For example, if the symbols were numbers, a rule might be "Even numbers can only be combined with odd numbers."

3. Operation Execution (200-250 words):
   Using your inferred rules, perform the specified operation ({t['operation']}) with the given symbols. Explain your process step-by-step, showing how you applied your rules. Your result should be a novel arrangement, transformation, or sequence of the symbols that demonstrates a clear application of your inferred rules.
   For example, if the operation was 'combine' and you had a rule about even and odd numbers, you might combine 2 and 3 to create 5, but not 2 and 4.

4. Extrapolation (100-150 words):
   Propose a new symbol that could logically be added to this set based on your inferred rules. Explain how this new symbol fits into the system and how it might interact with the existing symbols.

Ensure your response is creative, logically consistent, and demonstrates a deep understanding of abstract pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning. Use clear, concise language to explain your thought process throughout.
