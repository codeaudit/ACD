To diversify our task set, I'd like to propose a task family that focuses on a different aspect of AI capabilities: the ability to understand and manipulate abstract symbolic systems. This task will test the model's capacity for logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and creative problem-solving in a domain that doesn't rely on specific scientific knowledge. \n\nI'll design a task family called \"abstract_symbol_manipulation\" that requires the AI to work with a novel symbolic system, derive its rules, and then use it to solve problems. This task will be challenging as it requires the model to infer complex patterns and apply them in creative ways, but it should be solvable with the capabilities of advanced language models. The task will use an LLM judge for scoring, as the solutions may be open-ended and require nuanced evaluation.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"abstract_symbol_manipulation\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Analyze a novel abstract symbolic system, infer its rules, and use it to solve problems or create new expressions.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and creative problem-solving with abstract systems\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        symbol_sets = [\\n            ['\u26aa', '\u26ab', '\ud83d\udd3a', '\ud83d\udd3b', '\u25fb', '\u25fc'],\\n            ['\ud83c\udf11', '\ud83c\udf12', '\ud83c\udf13', '\ud83c\udf14', '\ud83c\udf15', '\ud83c\udf16', '\ud83c\udf17', '\ud83c\udf18'],\\n            ['\u2200', '\u2203', '\u2208', '\u2286', '\u2229', '\u222a', '\u2295', '\u00ac']\\n        ]\\n        \\n        operations = [\\n            'combine',\\n            'transform',\\n            'sequence'\\n        ]\\n        \\n        tasks = {}\\n        for i in range(1, 3):\\n            tasks[str(i)] = {\\n                'symbols': random.choice(symbol_sets),\\n                'operation': random.choice(operations)\\n            }\\n        return tasks\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        symbols = ' '.join(t['symbols'])\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"You are given a set of abstract symbols: {symbols}\\n\\nYour task is to analyze these symbols, infer potential rules or patterns governing their relationships, and then use them to perform the operation: {t['operation']}.\\n\\n1.

We can adjust the minimum word count check to be slightly more lenient, allowing for some variation in response length while still ensuring a substantial answer.\n\nLet's implement these minor improvements:\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"abstract_symbol_manipulation\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Analyze a novel abstract symbolic system, infer its rules, and use it to solve problems or create new expressions.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and creative problem-solving with abstract systems\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        symbol_sets = [\\n            ['\u26aa', '\u26ab', '\ud83d\udd3a', '\ud83d\udd3b', '\u25fb', '\u25fc'],\\n            ['\ud83c\udf11', '\ud83c\udf12', '\ud83c\udf13', '\ud83c\udf14', '\ud83c\udf15', '\ud83c\udf16', '\ud83c\udf17', '\ud83c\udf18'],\\n            ['\u2200', '\u2203', '\u2208', '\u2286', '\u2229', '\u222a', '\u2295', '\u00ac']\\n        ]\\n        \\n        operations = [\\n            'combine',\\n            'transform',\\n            'sequence'\\n        ]\\n        \\n        tasks = {}\\n        for i in range(1, 3):\\n            tasks[str(i)] = {\\n                'symbols': random.choice(symbol_sets),\\n                'operation': random.choice(operations)\\n            }\\n        return tasks\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        symbols = ' '.join(t['symbols'])\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"You are given a set of abstract symbols: {symbols}\\n\\nYour task is to analyze these symbols, infer potential rules or patterns governing their relationships, and then use them to perform the operation: {t['operation']}.

            "1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given symbols can be categorized based on their shapes and colors. There are circular symbols (\u26aa, \u26ab) and triangular symbols (\ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b), as well as rectangular symbols (\u25fb, \u25fc). Within each shape category, there are differences in color or shading: filled (\u26ab, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fc) versus unfilled or outlined (\u26aa, \ud83d\udd3a, \u25fb). This dichotomy of filled versus unfilled is consistent across all shapes. Additionally, the triangles have orientation differences (upward \ud83d\udd3a and downward \ud83d\udd3b), which is a unique feature compared to circles and rectangles.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Shapes Grouping - Symbols with the same shape (circle, triangle, rectangle) can form a subgroup.\nRule 2: Color/Shading Pairing - Within each shape subgroup, filled symbols can pair with unfilled symbols.\nRule 3: Orientation Constraint - For triangles, orientation must be considered; an upward triangle (\ud83d\udd3a) can only pair with a downward triangle (\ud83d\udd3b).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the symbols using the inferred rules, we will first group them by shape and then pair them based on color/shading and orientation. \n\n- Grouping by shape:\n  - Circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n  - Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n  - Rectangles: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\n- Pairing within groups:\n  - Circles: \u26aa pairs with \u26ab.\n  - Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a pairs with \ud83d\udd3b.\n  - Rectangles: \u25fb pairs with \u25fc.\n\n- Arranging pairs in a sequence:\n  - Start with one circle pair: \u26aa\u26ab.\n  - Follow with a triangle pair: \ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3b.\n  - End with a rectangle pair: \u25fb\u25fc.\n\nThus, a possible sequence following the rules could be: \u26aa\u26ab\ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3b\u25fb\u25fc. This sequence respects the grouping by shape, pairing by color/shading, and orientation constraints for triangles.\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that fits into this set could be a diamond shape (\u25c7 for unfilled and \u25c6 for filled). This new shape introduces another dimension of variation while maintaining the existing dichotomy of filled versus unfilled.\n\n- Interaction with existing symbols:\n  - Group: Diamonds form a new shape group.\n  - Pair: \u25c7 (unfilled diamond) pairs with \u25c6 (filled diamond).\n  - Sequence: The diamonds can follow the same sequencing rules, e.g., grouping by shape and pairing by color/shading.\n\nIncorporating diamonds, an extended sequence could be: \u26aa\u26ab\ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3b\u25fb\u25fc\u25c7\u25c6, demonstrating the consistency of the rules across the expanded set.",
            "1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given set of symbols includes circles (\u26aa, \u26ab), triangles (\ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b), and squares (\u25fb, \u25fc). These symbols can be categorized based on their shapes: circular, triangular, and square. Each shape category has a filled and an unfilled version, indicating a potential binary property (filled vs. unfilled). Additionally, the triangles are oriented differently (upward \ud83d\udd3a and downward \ud83d\udd3b), introducing another layer of distinction through directionality. The symbols also exhibit symmetry: circles and squares are symmetrical about their centers, while triangles have symmetry about their vertical axes.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Shape Grouping - Symbols can be grouped based on their shapes: circles, triangles, and squares.\nRule 2: Fill Status - Within each shape group, symbols are further categorized as filled or unfilled.\nRule 3: Directionality (for triangles) - Triangles are differentiated by their orientation: upward or downward.\nThese rules provide a framework for organizing the symbols based on their inherent properties, leading to a structured approach to sequencing them.\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nStep 1: Group the symbols by shape: \n   - Circles: \u26aa, \u26ab \n   - Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b \n   - Squares: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nStep 2: Within each shape group, arrange by fill status:\n   - Circles: \u26aa (unfilled), \u26ab (filled)\n   - Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a (unfilled upward), \ud83d\udd3b (unfilled downward), then \ud83d\udd3a (filled upward), \ud83d\udd3b (filled downward)\n   - Squares: \u25fb (unfilled), \u25fc (filled)\n\nStep 3: Sequence the symbols by organizing groups and fill statuses:\n   1. Circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n   2. Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b (unfilled, then filled)\n   3. Squares: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nFinal sequence: \n\u26aa, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, \u25fc\nThis sequence respects the shape grouping, fill status, and for triangles, the orientation.\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that fits within this system could be a diamond shape. To maintain consistency, it should have both filled and unfilled versions:\n   - Unfilled diamond: \u25c6\n   - Filled diamond: \u25c8\nThis new symbol fits into the system by introducing another shape category, which can interact based on the same rules of shape grouping and fill status. The updated shape categories would be circles, triangles, squares, and diamonds, each with their filled and unfilled versions. The new sequence would incorporate these as:\n\u26aa, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, \u25fc, \u25c6, \u25c8",
            "1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given set of symbols comprises two pairs of contrasting shapes and two contrasting colors: \u26aa (white circle) and \u26ab (black circle), \ud83d\udd3a (red triangle pointing up) and \ud83d\udd3b (red triangle pointing down), \u25fb (white square) and \u25fc (black square). Observing these symbols, it is evident that they are organized by both shape (circle, triangle, square) and color contrast (black vs. white for circles and squares; orientation contrast for triangles). The circles and squares contrast in color, while the triangles contrast in orientation. Additionally, these shapes exhibit symmetry: circles and squares are symmetric around their centers, while triangles are symmetric around their central vertical axis.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nBased on the analysis, the following rules can be inferred:\n   - Rule 1: Color Contrast Rule \u2013 Shapes of the same type (circle, square) must contrast in color when paired or sequenced.\n   - Rule 2: Shape Alternation Rule \u2013 Sequences must alternate between different shapes (circle, triangle, square).\n   - Rule 3: Orientation and Symmetry Rule \u2013 Triangles must alternate in orientation when included in a sequence (upward-facing followed by downward-facing or vice versa).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo perform the sequence operation using the inferred rules, the sequence must alternate shapes and satisfy the color contrast and orientation rules. Here\u2019s a step-by-step process:\n   Step 1: Start with a circle, \u26aa.\n   Step 2: Alternate to a triangle, choosing \ud83d\udd3b to introduce orientation contrast.\n   Step 3: Alternate to a square, choosing \u25fc to satisfy the color contrast rule with the previous shape (\u26aa).\n   Step 4: Alternate back to a circle, choosing \u26ab to maintain color contrast with the previous square (\u25fc).\n   Step 5: Alternate to a triangle, choosing \ud83d\udd3a to maintain the orientation contrast with the previous triangle (\ud83d\udd3b).\n   Step 6: Finish with a square, choosing \u25fb to satisfy the color contrast rule with the previous shape (\u26ab).\n\nThe resulting sequence is: \u26aa, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fc, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \u25fb. This sequence adheres to the rules of alternating shapes, maintaining color contrast, and alternating triangle orientations.\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that could be logically added to this set is a diamond shape, represented as \u25c6 or \u25c7, with the same color contrasts (white and black). This fits into the system by adding another geometric shape while maintaining the established color contrast rule. The new symbols could be \u25c7 (white diamond) and \u25c6 (black diamond). They would interact with existing symbols by providing additional elements to alternate shapes within a sequence, and they would follow the same rules of color contrast and symmetry. For example, a sequence might include \u26aa, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fc, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \u25c7 to maintain the established pattern.",
            "1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe set of symbols includes shapes that vary in terms of color, complexity, and orientation. The symbols \u26aa and \u26ab are circles, differing only in color (white and black, respectively). \ud83d\udd3a and \ud83d\udd3b are triangles, differing in orientation (upward and downward, respectively). \u25fb and \u25fc are squares, differing in color (white and black, respectively). The primary properties include shape (circle, triangle, square), color (black, white), and orientation (only for triangles). Shapes suggest a geometric categorization, while color introduces an element of duality or opposition. The triangles\u2019 orientation adds a dimension of directionality.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Shapes can be categorized into three distinct groups: circles, triangles, and squares.\nRule 2: Within each shape category, symbols can be paired based on color opposites (e.g., \u26aa with \u26ab, \u25fb with \u25fc).\nRule 3: Triangles have an additional rule based on orientation, where an upward triangle (\ud83d\udd3a) is paired with a downward triangle (\ud83d\udd3b).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the symbols, first categorize them by shape:\n- Circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n- Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n- Squares: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nNext, apply Rule 2 to pair them by color opposites within each shape category:\n- Circle pair: \u26aa, \u26ab\n- Square pair: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nFor the triangles, use both Rule 2 and Rule 3:\n- Triangle pair: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n\nNow, sequence these pairs to form a structured arrangement:\n1. Start with the circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n2. Follow with the triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n3. End with the squares: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nThe final sequence, adhering to the inferred rules, is:\n\u26aa, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, \u25fc\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that could be added is a diamond shape (e.g., \ud83d\udd37 for a white diamond and \ud83d\udd36 for a black diamond). This new shape fits the system's geometric categorization and color duality. It introduces another shape category while maintaining the existing color opposition rules. It would interact with the current symbols by forming a new pair: \ud83d\udd37 with \ud83d\udd36. This ensures consistency with the inferred rules, expanding the set while adhering to the established patterns of shape and color.",
            "1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given symbols \u26aa, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, and \u25fc exhibit distinct shapes and properties. \u26aa and \u26ab are circles, with the primary difference being color (white and black, respectively). \ud83d\udd3a and \ud83d\udd3b are triangles, with orientations pointing upwards and downwards. \u25fb and \u25fc are squares, differentiated by color (white and black). The shapes include circles, triangles, and squares, with properties like color (white/black) and orientation (upward/downward) distinguishing them further. Symmetry is a common feature: circles are rotationally symmetric, triangles have a vertical axis of symmetry, and squares are symmetric across their diagonals and axes.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Color Pairing \u2013 Symbols of the same shape must alternate in color when arranged sequentially (e.g., \u26aa must be followed by \u26ab if they are adjacent).\nRule 2: Shape Transition \u2013 The sequence must alternate between different shapes (e.g., after a circle, the next symbol must be a triangle or square, not another circle).\nRule 3: Orientation Consistency \u2013 Triangles must maintain a consistent orientation when placed sequentially (e.g., \ud83d\udd3a must be followed by \ud83d\udd3a or \ud83d\udd3b must be followed by \ud83d\udd3b).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the given symbols using the inferred rules, we start by ensuring alternation in shape and color, and maintaining orientation consistency for triangles.\n\nStep 1: Begin with a circle, \u26aa.\nStep 2: Follow with a different shape, a triangle, \ud83d\udd3a.\nStep 3: Alternate the color with another circle, \u26ab.\nStep 4: Follow with the same orientation triangle, \ud83d\udd3b (since the rule allows same orientation to follow).\nStep 5: Introduce a new shape, a square, \u25fb.\nStep 6: Follow with the alternating color square, \u25fc.\n\nThe sequence thus formed is: \u26aa, \ud83d\udd3a, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, \u25fc.\n\nThis sequence adheres to the rules: alternating shapes, alternating colors for same shapes, and consistent orientation for triangles.\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that could logically fit into this set is a hexagon, differentiated by color. For example, a white hexagon, \u2b21, and a black hexagon, \u2b22. This new symbol fits as it adds another shape, maintaining the pattern of having two colors for each shape. The hexagon would follow similar rules: alternating colors when placed sequentially and fitting into the shape transition rule. For instance, after a square, a hexagon can follow, and it must alternate in color if another hexagon follows. This maintains the system's logical consistency and expands the diversity of shapes within the set."

Each symbol depicts a different stage in the lunar cycle, starting with the New Moon (\ud83c\udf11) and progressing through various crescents and quarters to the Full Moon (\ud83c\udf15), before waning back to the New Moon. The primary pattern is a cyclical progression from darkness to full illumination and back to darkness, marked by gradual changes in the visible portion of the Moon. The symbols exhibit symmetry and incremental complexity, with each subsequent symbol showing an increasing or decreasing portion of the Moon's surface illuminated.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: The sequence progresses incrementally from least illuminated (\ud83c\udf11) to most illuminated (\ud83c\udf15) and back to least illuminated, forming a cyclical pattern.\nRule 2: Adjacent symbols in the sequence must represent consecutive phases of the Moon, with no skips or reversals.\nRule 3: Each symbol can be paired only with its immediate predecessor or successor in the lunar cycle, ensuring a smooth transition without abrupt changes.\n\n3.

The symbols exhibit a cyclical pattern and symmetry, with the full moon at the center and the new moon at both ends. Each phase is a gradual transition from dark to fully illuminated (new moon to full moon) and then back to dark (full moon to new moon).\n\n2. **Rule Inference**:\n   - **Rule 1: Sequential Order**: The symbols must follow a specific sequential order that reflects the natural progression of the moon phases.\n   - **Rule 2: Symmetry**: The arrangement of the symbols should be symmetric around the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), reflecting the waxing and waning phases.\n   - **Rule 3: Completeness**: Any sequence must include all the phases to represent a complete lunar cycle.\n   \n3. **Operation Execution**:\n   To sequence the given symbols according to the inferred rules, we start with the new moon (\ud83c\udf11) and progress through the waxing phases to the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), then continue through the waning phases back to the new moon. Following Rule 1, the sequence should be:\n   - \ud83c\udf11 (new moon)\n   - \ud83c\udf12 (waxing crescent)\n   - \ud83c\udf13 (first quarter)\n   - \ud83c\udf14 (waxing gibbous)\n   - \ud83c\udf15 (full moon)\n   - \ud83c\udf16 (waning gibbous)\n   - \ud83c\udf17 (last quarter)\n   - \ud83c\udf18 (waning crescent)\n   This sequence follows the natural lunar progression, maintains symmetry around the full moon (Rule 2), and includes all phases (Rule 3).

The Blue Moon is an additional full moon that occurs within a calendar month, which fits within the lunar cycle concept. This symbol would logically fit into the system by representing an anomaly or special event within the cycle. It could be placed after the full moon (\ud83c\udf15) but before the waning gibbous (\ud83c\udf16), indicating a rare occurrence.

The shapes exhibit a clear pattern of waxing (increasing illumination) and waning (decreasing illumination). Symmetry is also a key aspect, with the symbols on either side of the full moon being mirror images of each other.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: The symbols must follow a sequential order based on the moon's phases, from new moon to full moon and back to new moon.\nRule 2: Each symbol can only be adjacent to its immediate predecessor or successor in the moon phase cycle.\nRule 3: The waxing symbols (\ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14) must precede the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), and the waning symbols (\ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, \ud83c\udf18) must follow the full moon.\n\n3.

They follow a cyclical pattern in which the moon appears to grow from \ud83c\udf11 to \ud83c\udf15 and then diminishes back to \ud83c\udf11. The symbols are ordered in a sequence showing gradual changes in illumination. The shapes transition from completely dark (\ud83c\udf11) to fully illuminated (\ud83c\udf15) and back to dark. This pattern is symmetrical around the full moon and represents a natural cycle.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: The symbols are arranged in a cyclic order based on the illumination of the moon, starting from no illumination (\ud83c\udf11) to full illumination (\ud83c\udf15) and back to no illumination (\ud83c\udf11).\nRule 2: Each subsequent symbol increases or decreases incrementally in the illuminated portion of the moon, forming a continuous and smooth transition.\nRule 3: The sequence can be divided into two distinct halves: the waxing phase (\ud83c\udf11 to \ud83c\udf15) and the waning phase (\ud83c\udf15 to \ud83c\udf11).

Each symbol depicts a different stage in the lunar cycle, progressing from a new moon (\ud83c\udf11) to a full moon (\ud83c\udf15) and back to a new moon. The symbols exhibit a clear progression in terms of the illuminated portion of the moon, starting from completely dark (\ud83c\udf11), gradually increasing in light through \ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, and \ud83c\udf14, reaching full illumination at \ud83c\udf15, and then decreasing through \ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, and \ud83c\udf18. The shapes are symmetrical along a vertical axis, and the progression is cyclic, suggesting a repetitive pattern.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1. **Illumination Progression Rule**: The symbols represent a sequence based on the increasing and then decreasing illumination of the moon. This rule dictates that the symbols must follow a logical order from no illumination to full illumination and back to no illumination.\n2. **Symmetry Rule**: The symbols are symmetrical along a vertical axis, with each symbol representing a specific stage in the lunar cycle.

            "Answer: \n\n1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given symbols can be categorized based on their shapes and colors. There are circular symbols (\u26aa, \u26ab) and triangular symbols (\ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b), as well as rectangular symbols (\u25fb, \u25fc). Within each shape category, there are differences in color or shading: filled (\u26ab, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fc) versus unfilled or outlined (\u26aa, \ud83d\udd3a, \u25fb). This dichotomy of filled versus unfilled is consistent across all shapes. Additionally, the triangles have orientation differences (upward \ud83d\udd3a and downward \ud83d\udd3b), which is a unique feature compared to circles and rectangles.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Shapes Grouping - Symbols with the same shape (circle, triangle, rectangle) can form a subgroup.\nRule 2: Color/Shading Pairing - Within each shape subgroup, filled symbols can pair with unfilled symbols.\nRule 3: Orientation Constraint - For triangles, orientation must be considered; an upward triangle (\ud83d\udd3a) can only pair with a downward triangle (\ud83d\udd3b).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the symbols using the inferred rules, we will first group them by shape and then pair them based on color/shading and orientation. \n\n- Grouping by shape:\n  - Circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n  - Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n  - Rectangles: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\n- Pairing within groups:\n  - Circles: \u26aa pairs with \u26ab.\n  - Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a pairs with \ud83d\udd3b.\n  - Rectangles: \u25fb pairs with \u25fc.\n\n- Arranging pairs in a sequence:\n  - Start with one circle pair: \u26aa\u26ab.\n  - Follow with a triangle pair: \ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3b.\n  - End with a rectangle pair: \u25fb\u25fc.\n\nThus, a possible sequence following the rules could be: \u26aa\u26ab\ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udd3b\u25fb\u25fc.

These symbols can be categorized based on their shapes: circular, triangular, and square. Each shape category has a filled and an unfilled version, indicating a potential binary property (filled vs. unfilled). Additionally, the triangles are oriented differently (upward \ud83d\udd3a and downward \ud83d\udd3b), introducing another layer of distinction through directionality. The symbols also exhibit symmetry: circles and squares are symmetrical about their centers, while triangles have symmetry about their vertical axes.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Shape Grouping - Symbols can be grouped based on their shapes: circles, triangles, and squares.\nRule 2: Fill Status - Within each shape group, symbols are further categorized as filled or unfilled.\nRule 3: Directionality (for triangles) - Triangles are differentiated by their orientation: upward or downward.\nThese rules provide a framework for organizing the symbols based on their inherent properties, leading to a structured approach to sequencing them.\n\n3.

Observing these symbols, it is evident that they are organized by both shape (circle, triangle, square) and color contrast (black vs. white for circles and squares; orientation contrast for triangles). The circles and squares contrast in color, while the triangles contrast in orientation. Additionally, these shapes exhibit symmetry: circles and squares are symmetric around their centers, while triangles are symmetric around their central vertical axis.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nBased on the analysis, the following rules can be inferred:\n   - Rule 1: Color Contrast Rule \u2013 Shapes of the same type (circle, square) must contrast in color when paired or sequenced.\n   - Rule 2: Shape Alternation Rule \u2013 Sequences must alternate between different shapes (circle, triangle, square).\n   - Rule 3: Orientation and Symmetry Rule \u2013 Triangles must alternate in orientation when included in a sequence (upward-facing followed by downward-facing or vice versa).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo perform the sequence operation using the inferred rules, the sequence must alternate shapes and satisfy the color contrast and orientation rules. Here\u2019s a step-by-step process:\n   Step 1: Start with a circle, \u26aa.\n   Step 2: Alternate to a triangle, choosing \ud83d\udd3b to introduce orientation contrast.\n   Step 3: Alternate to a square, choosing \u25fc to satisfy the color contrast rule with the previous shape (\u26aa).\n   Step 4: Alternate back to a circle, choosing \u26ab to maintain color contrast with the previous square (\u25fc).\n   Step 5: Alternate to a triangle, choosing \ud83d\udd3a to maintain the orientation contrast with the previous triangle (\ud83d\udd3b).\n   Step 6: Finish with a square, choosing \u25fb to satisfy the color contrast rule with the previous shape (\u26ab).\n\nThe resulting sequence is: \u26aa, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fc, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \u25fb.

This fits into the system by adding another geometric shape while maintaining the established color contrast rule. The new symbols could be \u25c7 (white diamond) and \u25c6 (black diamond). They would interact with existing symbols by providing additional elements to alternate shapes within a sequence, and they would follow the same rules of color contrast and symmetry. For example, a sequence might include \u26aa, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fc, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \u25c7 to maintain the established pattern.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe set of symbols includes shapes that vary in terms of color, complexity, and orientation. The symbols \u26aa and \u26ab are circles, differing only in color (white and black, respectively). \ud83d\udd3a and \ud83d\udd3b are triangles, differing in orientation (upward and downward, respectively). \u25fb and \u25fc are squares, differing in color (white and black, respectively). The primary properties include shape (circle, triangle, square), color (black, white), and orientation (only for triangles). Shapes suggest a geometric categorization, while color introduces an element of duality or opposition. The triangles\u2019 orientation adds a dimension of directionality.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Shapes can be categorized into three distinct groups: circles, triangles, and squares.\nRule 2: Within each shape category, symbols can be paired based on color opposites (e.g., \u26aa with \u26ab, \u25fb with \u25fc).\nRule 3: Triangles have an additional rule based on orientation, where an upward triangle (\ud83d\udd3a) is paired with a downward triangle (\ud83d\udd3b).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the symbols, first categorize them by shape:\n- Circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n- Triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n- Squares: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nNext, apply Rule 2 to pair them by color opposites within each shape category:\n- Circle pair: \u26aa, \u26ab\n- Square pair: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nFor the triangles, use both Rule 2 and Rule 3:\n- Triangle pair: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n\nNow, sequence these pairs to form a structured arrangement:\n1. Start with the circles: \u26aa, \u26ab\n2. Follow with the triangles: \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b\n3. End with the squares: \u25fb, \u25fc\n\nThe final sequence, adhering to the inferred rules, is:\n\u26aa, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, \u25fc\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that could be added is a diamond shape (e.g., \ud83d\udd37 for a white diamond and \ud83d\udd36 for a black diamond). This new shape fits the system's geometric categorization and color duality. It introduces another shape category while maintaining the existing color opposition rules. It would interact with the current symbols by forming a new pair: \ud83d\udd37 with \ud83d\udd36. This ensures consistency with the inferred rules, expanding the set while adhering to the established patterns of shape and color.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given symbols \u26aa, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3a, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, and \u25fc exhibit distinct shapes and properties. \u26aa and \u26ab are circles, with the primary difference being color (white and black, respectively). \ud83d\udd3a and \ud83d\udd3b are triangles, with orientations pointing upwards and downwards. \u25fb and \u25fc are squares, differentiated by color (white and black). The shapes include circles, triangles, and squares, with properties like color (white/black) and orientation (upward/downward) distinguishing them further. Symmetry is a common feature: circles are rotationally symmetric, triangles have a vertical axis of symmetry, and squares are symmetric across their diagonals and axes.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: Color Pairing \u2013 Symbols of the same shape must alternate in color when arranged sequentially (e.g., \u26aa must be followed by \u26ab if they are adjacent).\nRule 2: Shape Transition \u2013 The sequence must alternate between different shapes (e.g., after a circle, the next symbol must be a triangle or square, not another circle).\nRule 3: Orientation Consistency \u2013 Triangles must maintain a consistent orientation when placed sequentially (e.g., \ud83d\udd3a must be followed by \ud83d\udd3a or \ud83d\udd3b must be followed by \ud83d\udd3b).\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the given symbols using the inferred rules, we start by ensuring alternation in shape and color, and maintaining orientation consistency for triangles.\n\nStep 1: Begin with a circle, \u26aa.\nStep 2: Follow with a different shape, a triangle, \ud83d\udd3a.\nStep 3: Alternate the color with another circle, \u26ab.\nStep 4: Follow with the same orientation triangle, \ud83d\udd3b (since the rule allows same orientation to follow).\nStep 5: Introduce a new shape, a square, \u25fb.\nStep 6: Follow with the alternating color square, \u25fc.\n\nThe sequence thus formed is: \u26aa, \ud83d\udd3a, \u26ab, \ud83d\udd3b, \u25fb, \u25fc.\n\nThis sequence adheres to the rules: alternating shapes, alternating colors for same shapes, and consistent orientation for triangles.\n\n4. Extrapolation:\nA new symbol that could logically fit into this set is a hexagon, differentiated by color. For example, a white hexagon, \u2b21, and a black hexagon, \u2b22. This new symbol fits as it adds another shape, maintaining the pattern of having two colors for each shape. The hexagon would follow similar rules: alternating colors when placed sequentially and fitting into the shape transition rule. For instance, after a square, a hexagon can follow, and it must alternate in color if another hexagon follows. This maintains the system's logical consistency and expands the diversity of shapes within the set."

Each symbol depicts a different stage in the lunar cycle, starting with the New Moon (\ud83c\udf11) and progressing through various crescents and quarters to the Full Moon (\ud83c\udf15), before waning back to the New Moon. The primary pattern is a cyclical progression from darkness to full illumination and back to darkness, marked by gradual changes in the visible portion of the Moon. The symbols exhibit symmetry and incremental complexity, with each subsequent symbol showing an increasing or decreasing portion of the Moon's surface illuminated.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: The sequence progresses incrementally from least illuminated (\ud83c\udf11) to most illuminated (\ud83c\udf15) and back to least illuminated, forming a cyclical pattern.\nRule 2: Adjacent symbols in the sequence must represent consecutive phases of the Moon, with no skips or reversals.\nRule 3: Each symbol can be paired only with its immediate predecessor or successor in the lunar cycle, ensuring a smooth transition without abrupt changes.\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo sequence the given symbols based on the inferred rules, we will arrange them in a cyclical order that reflects the natural progression of the lunar phases.

The Blue Moon is a rare event that occurs when there is an extra full moon in a calendar month. This symbol fits into the system as an extension of the Full Moon (\ud83c\udf15) phase but is distinguished by its rarity. It interacts with the existing symbols by providing a special marker within the cycle, occurring after the Full Moon and before the waning phases, symbolizing a unique, infrequent event that still follows the established rules of lunar progression and cyclical nature.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. **Symbol Analysis**:\n   The given set of symbols \ud83c\udf11 \ud83c\udf12 \ud83c\udf13 \ud83c\udf14 \ud83c\udf15 \ud83c\udf16 \ud83c\udf17 \ud83c\udf18 represents the phases of the moon. The sequence starts from the new moon (\ud83c\udf11), progresses through the waxing phases (\ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14) to the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), and then through the waning phases (\ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, \ud83c\udf18) back to the new moon. The symbols exhibit a cyclical pattern and symmetry, with the full moon at the center and the new moon at both ends. Each phase is a gradual transition from dark to fully illuminated (new moon to full moon) and then back to dark (full moon to new moon).\n\n2. **Rule Inference**:\n   - **Rule 1: Sequential Order**: The symbols must follow a specific sequential order that reflects the natural progression of the moon phases.\n   - **Rule 2: Symmetry**: The arrangement of the symbols should be symmetric around the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), reflecting the waxing and waning phases.\n   - **Rule 3: Completeness**: Any sequence must include all the phases to represent a complete lunar cycle.\n   \n3. **Operation Execution**:\n   To sequence the given symbols according to the inferred rules, we start with the new moon (\ud83c\udf11) and progress through the waxing phases to the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), then continue through the waning phases back to the new moon. Following Rule 1, the sequence should be:\n   - \ud83c\udf11 (new moon)\n   - \ud83c\udf12 (waxing crescent)\n   - \ud83c\udf13 (first quarter)\n   - \ud83c\udf14 (waxing gibbous)\n   - \ud83c\udf15 (full moon)\n   - \ud83c\udf16 (waning gibbous)\n   - \ud83c\udf17 (last quarter)\n   - \ud83c\udf18 (waning crescent)\n   This sequence follows the natural lunar progression, maintains symmetry around the full moon (Rule 2), and includes all phases (Rule 3).

The Blue Moon is an additional full moon that occurs within a calendar month, which fits within the lunar cycle concept. This symbol would logically fit into the system by representing an anomaly or special event within the cycle. It could be placed after the full moon (\ud83c\udf15) but before the waning gibbous (\ud83c\udf16), indicating a rare occurrence. It interacts with the existing symbols by introducing an additional full moon phase, thus slightly altering the symmetry and sequence but still adhering to the cyclical nature of the lunar phases.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. Symbol Analysis:\nThe given symbols \ud83c\udf11, \ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14, \ud83c\udf15, \ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, and \ud83c\udf18 represent the various phases of the moon. They follow a sequential progression from the new moon (\ud83c\udf11) to the full moon (\ud83c\udf15) and then back towards the new moon. The primary properties observed include their gradual change in illumination, starting from no visible light (\ud83c\udf11), increasing to half-lit (\ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14), and fully lit (\ud83c\udf15), then decreasing back to no visible light (\ud83c\udf18). The shapes exhibit a clear pattern of waxing (increasing illumination) and waning (decreasing illumination). Symmetry is also a key aspect, with the symbols on either side of the full moon being mirror images of each other.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: The symbols must follow a sequential order based on the moon's phases, from new moon to full moon and back to new moon.\nRule 2: Each symbol can only be adjacent to its immediate predecessor or successor in the moon phase cycle.\nRule 3: The waxing symbols (\ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14) must precede the full moon (\ud83c\udf15), and the waning symbols (\ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, \ud83c\udf18) must follow the full moon.\n\n3. Operation Execution:\nTo perform the \"sequence\" operation, we apply the inferred rules to arrange the symbols in their correct order:\nStep 1: Identify the starting point, which is the new moon (\ud83c\udf11).\nStep 2: Follow the waxing sequence: \ud83c\udf11 (new moon) \u2192 \ud83c\udf12 (waxing crescent) \u2192 \ud83c\udf13 (first quarter) \u2192 \ud83c\udf14 (waxing gibbous).\nStep 3: Place the full moon (\ud83c\udf15) next as it represents the peak illumination.\nStep 4: Follow the waning sequence: \ud83c\udf15 (full moon) \u2192 \ud83c\udf16 (waning gibbous) \u2192 \ud83c\udf17 (last quarter) \u2192 \ud83c\udf18 (waning crescent).\nStep 5: Ensure the sequence forms a complete cycle by potentially connecting back to the new moon if required.\n\nThus, the arranged sequence is: \ud83c\udf11, \ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14, \ud83c\udf15, \ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, \ud83c\udf18.\n\n4.

This symbol would fit logically as an enhancement of the full moon phase, indicating when the moon appears larger due to its closer proximity to Earth. It would interact with the existing symbols by being placed immediately after or before the full moon (\ud83c\udf15) in the sequence, representing a special case within the cycle. Hence, the extended sequence might look like: \ud83c\udf11, \ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, \ud83c\udf14, \ud83c\udf15, \ud83c\udf1d, \ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, \ud83c\udf18.

They follow a cyclical pattern in which the moon appears to grow from \ud83c\udf11 to \ud83c\udf15 and then diminishes back to \ud83c\udf11. The symbols are ordered in a sequence showing gradual changes in illumination. The shapes transition from completely dark (\ud83c\udf11) to fully illuminated (\ud83c\udf15) and back to dark. This pattern is symmetrical around the full moon and represents a natural cycle.\n\n2. Rule Inference:\nRule 1: The symbols are arranged in a cyclic order based on the illumination of the moon, starting from no illumination (\ud83c\udf11) to full illumination (\ud83c\udf15) and back to no illumination (\ud83c\udf11).\nRule 2: Each subsequent symbol increases or decreases incrementally in the illuminated portion of the moon, forming a continuous and smooth transition.\nRule 3: The sequence can be divided into two distinct halves: the waxing phase (\ud83c\udf11 to \ud83c\udf15) and the waning phase (\ud83c\udf15 to \ud83c\udf11). Each half mirrors the other in terms of the transition of the illuminated portion.\n\n3.

It would illustrate the very first sliver of light visible after the new moon, fitting consistently with the incremental increase in illumination. This new symbol, \ud83c\udf19, would be placed between \ud83c\udf11 and \ud83c\udf12, reflecting the start of the moon's waxing journey.

Each symbol depicts a different stage in the lunar cycle, progressing from a new moon (\ud83c\udf11) to a full moon (\ud83c\udf15) and back to a new moon. The symbols exhibit a clear progression in terms of the illuminated portion of the moon, starting from completely dark (\ud83c\udf11), gradually increasing in light through \ud83c\udf12, \ud83c\udf13, and \ud83c\udf14, reaching full illumination at \ud83c\udf15, and then decreasing through \ud83c\udf16, \ud83c\udf17, and \ud83c\udf18. The shapes are symmetrical along a vertical axis, and the progression is cyclic, suggesting a repetitive pattern.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1. **Illumination Progression Rule**: The symbols represent a sequence based on the increasing and then decreasing illumination of the moon. This rule dictates that the symbols must follow a logical order from no illumination to full illumination and back to no illumination.\n2. **Symmetry Rule**: The symbols are symmetrical along a vertical axis, with each symbol representing a specific stage in the lunar cycle. This symmetry must be preserved when arranging the symbols.\n3. **Cyclic Nature Rule**: The sequence is cyclic, meaning that after the last symbol (\ud83c\udf18), the sequence would logically revert to the first symbol (\ud83c\udf11), maintaining a continuous loop.\n\n**Operation Execution:**\nTo perform the 'sequence' operation using the inferred rules, I will arrange the symbols in a logical progression based on the illumination progression rule. \n\n1. **Starting Point**: The sequence begins with the new moon (\ud83c\udf11), as it represents the start of the lunar cycle.\n2. **Increasing Illumination**: From the new moon, the sequence follows the symbols with increasing illumination: \ud83c\udf12 (waxing crescent), \ud83c\udf13 (first quarter), and \ud83c\udf14 (waxing gibbous).\n3. **Full Illumination**: The full moon (\ud83c\udf15) represents the peak of the cycle with maximum illumination.\n4. **Decreasing Illumination**: The sequence then follows the symbols with decreasing illumination: \ud83c\udf16 (waning gibbous), \ud83c\udf17 (last quarter), and \ud83c\udf18 (waning crescent).\n5. **Cyclic Return**: After \ud83c\udf18, the sequence returns to \ud83c\udf11, maintaining the cyclic nature.\n\nThus, the sequence based on the inferred rules is:\n\ud83c\udf11 \u2192 \ud83c\udf12 \u2192 \ud83c\udf13 \u2192 \ud83c\udf14 \u2192 \ud83c\udf15 \u2192 \ud83c\udf16 \u2192 \ud83c\udf17 \u2192 \ud83c\udf18 \u2192 \ud83c\udf11 ...\n\n**Extrapolation:**\nA new symbol that could logically be added to this set might be a symbol representing a partially illuminated moon, specifically between the waxing crescent (\ud83c\udf12) and the first quarter (\ud83c\udf13). This new symbol could look like a crescent moon with slightly more illumination than \ud83c\udf12 but less than \ud83c\udf13.\n\nLet's call this new symbol \ud83c\udf13.\n\n**Integration**: The new symbol \ud83c\udf13 fits into the sequence as it represents a transition stage between \ud83c\udf12 and \ud83c\udf13. The updated sequence incorporating the new symbol would be:\n\ud83c\udf11 \u2192 \ud83c\udf12 \u2192 \ud83c\udf13 \u2192 \ud83c\udf13 \u2192 \ud83c\udf14 \u2192 \ud83c\udf15 \u2192 \ud83c\udf16 \u2192 \ud83c\udf17 \u2192 \ud83c\udf18 \u2192 \ud83c\udf11 ...\n\nThis addition maintains the logical progression of illumination and fits seamlessly into the cyclic pattern of the lunar phases."

            "content": "Given the nature of the task family \"abstract_symbol_manipulation,\" it is designed to assess high-level abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and creative problem-solving with novel symbolic systems. These are complex cognitive skills that are typically challenging even for advanced LLMs, as they require not only understanding abstract patterns but also creating consistent and logical rules and applying them coherently.\n\n### Considerations:\n1. **Pattern Recognition and Logical Reasoning**: LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in recognizing patterns and performing logical reasoning, especially in well-defined contexts. However, abstract and novel symbol sets present a unique challenge because they lack the contextual grounding found in more common tasks.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: This aspect is particularly difficult for LLMs, as it involves generating new, logically consistent rules and novel solutions based on inferred patterns. Creativity in problem-solving is a higher-order cognitive skill that LLMs often struggle with.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The evaluation criteria outlined require a nuanced judgment of creativity, logical consistency, and depth of understanding. The use of another LLM to judge these aspects adds a layer of complexity, as it relies on the judging LLM's ability to accurately assess the quality of abstract reasoning and creativity.\n\n4. **Task Difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is marked as \"difficult,\" indicating that even for humans, this task requires substantial cognitive effort. Therefore, an LLM succeeding in such a task would be noteworthy.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering the task's complexity and the high cognitive demands it places on abstract reasoning and creative problem-solving, the success of the LLM agent on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy. This success suggests that the LLM possesses advanced capabilities in abstract thinking and creative reasoning that go beyond typical pattern recognition tasks.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
