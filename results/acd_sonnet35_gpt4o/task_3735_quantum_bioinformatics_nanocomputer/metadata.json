A quantum-biological nanocomputer is a hypothetical device that combines principles from quantum computing and molecular biology to perform computations at the nanoscale using biological molecules.\n\nYour design should incorporate the quantum concept of superposition, the biological mechanism of DNA replication, and the information theory principle of error correction. Additionally, you must address the challenge of quantum decoherence in biological systems. Provide your response in the following format:\n\n1.
