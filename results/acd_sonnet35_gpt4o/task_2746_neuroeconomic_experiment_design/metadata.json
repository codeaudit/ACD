This task would be challenging and could reveal surprising capabilities or limitations in the AI's understanding of human behavior, brain function, and economic principles.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"neuroeconomic_experiment_design\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design and analyze hypothetical neuroeconomic experiments that investigate the neural basis of economic decision-making under various conditions.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary knowledge integration, experimental design, analytical reasoning, and understanding of human decision-making processes\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        decision_contexts = [\\n            {\\n                \\\"context\\\": \\\"Intertemporal choice\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Decisions involving tradeoffs between immediate and delayed rewards\\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"context\\\": \\\"Social decision-making\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Decisions affecting both self and others, involving concepts like fairness and reciprocity\\\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        neural_techniques = [\\n            {\\n                \\\"technique\\\": \\\"fMRI\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to measure brain activity\\\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"technique\\\": \\\"EEG\\\",\\n                \\\"description\\\": \\\"Electroencephalography to measure electrical activity in the brain\\\"\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"decision_context\\\": random.choice(decision_contexts),\\n                \\\"neural_technique\\\": random.choice(neural_techniques)\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"decision_context\\\": random.choice(decision_contexts),\\n                \\\"neural_technique\\\": random.choice(neural_techniques)\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design a hypothetical neuroeconomic experiment that investigates the neural basis of economic decision-making in the context of {t['decision_context']['context']} using {t['neural_technique']['technique']}.

            "### Experimental Design\n**a) Overall Structure**\nThe experiment will involve participants making a series of intertemporal choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards. Each participant will undergo two sessions: a baseline session and a stress manipulation session. In both sessions, participants will perform the same intertemporal choice task while EEG data is recorded.\n\n**b) Tradeoffs between Immediate and Delayed Rewards**\nParticipants will be presented with choices such as receiving $50 today or $100 in 30 days. The reward amounts and delay periods will vary systematically to capture a range of intertemporal preferences. The task design will be based on the discounting paradigm, where the subjective value of delayed rewards decreases as the delay increases.\n\n**c) Use of EEG**\nEEG will be used to measure brain activity during decision-making. Key EEG metrics will include event-related potentials (ERPs) and frequency band power (e.g., theta and alpha bands). Electrodes will be placed according to the 10-20 system, focusing on prefrontal and parietal regions known to be involved in decision-making.\n\n**d) Control Conditions**\nA within-subject design will be used, with each participant serving as their own control. The baseline session (no stress) will be compared to the stress session, allowing for examination of how stress influences decision-making and neural activity.\n\n**e) Incorporating Stress Manipulation**\nStress will be induced using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), which includes public speaking and mental arithmetic tasks performed in front of an audience. The stress level will be confirmed by measuring cortisol levels before and after the TSST.\n\n**f) Participants**\nA minimum of 50 participants will be recruited to ensure sufficient statistical power to detect differences in decision-making and neural activity between conditions. This sample size is justified based on previous EEG studies examining intertemporal choice.\n\n**g) Game-Theoretic Approach**\nWhile not strictly game-theoretic, the design incorporates elements of decision theory and behavioral economics, particularly the concept of hyperbolic discounting.\n\n**h) Novel Neuroeconomic Measure**\nA novel aspect of the experiment is the use of a \"Neural Discount Rate\" (NDR), calculated by correlating EEG-derived neural activity patterns with individual discount rates. This measure will provide a direct link between neural data and economic behavior.\n\n### Hypotheses and Predictions\n**a) Hypotheses**\n1. Stress will increase the preference for immediate rewards over delayed rewards.\n2. Neural activity in the prefrontal cortex will differ between stressed and non-stressed conditions, reflecting changes in decision-making processes.\n\n**b) Behavioral Outcomes**\nUnder stress, participants are expected to choose immediate rewards more frequently, indicating a higher discount rate for delayed rewards.\n\n**c) Neural Activity Patterns**\nIncreased prefrontal cortex activity (theta band) is anticipated during decision-making in non-stressed conditions. Under stress, we expect reduced prefrontal activity and increased amygdala-related activity, indicating emotional influence on decision-making.\n\n**d) Effect of Stress Manipulation**\nStress is hypothesized to exacerbate preferences for immediate rewards, potentially revealing a stronger correlation between stress-related neural markers (e.g., heightened cortisol levels) and altered economic choices.\n\n### Data Analysis Plan\n**a) Key Measures and Variables**\nBehavioral data: choice patterns (immediate vs. delayed rewards) and calculated discount rates.\nNeural data: ERP components (e.g., P300, N200) and power in specific frequency bands (theta, alpha).\n\n**b) Statistical Methods**\nBehavioral data will be analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression to account for within-subject variability. Neural data will be analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA to compare ERP amplitudes and frequency power across conditions.\n\n**c) Integration of Behavioral and Neural Data**\nCorrelation analyses will be conducted to link neural activity (e.g., ERP amplitudes, frequency power) with discount rates. Multivariate regression models will integrate behavioral and neural predictors to explain variance in decision-making.\n\n**d) Controlling for Confounding Variables**\nPotential confounders such as baseline stress levels, sleep quality, and caffeine intake will be controlled through questionnaires and exclusion criteria. Covariates like age and gender will be included in statistical models.\n\n### Potential Implications\n**a) Informing Economic Theory**\nResults could refine models of intertemporal choice by incorporating neural data, particularly under stress. This could lead to more accurate predictions of economic behavior in real-world stressful situations.\n\n**b) Real-World Applications**\nFindings could inform policies on financial decision-making, stress management programs, and interventions aimed at improving long-term planning and savings behavior.\n\n**c) Contribution to Understanding Economic Behavior**\nThe experiment will advance knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying economic decisions and how stress influences these processes, bridging gaps between economics, psychology, and neuroscience.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n**a) Potential Ethical Issues**\nStress induction and EEG procedures may pose risks such as discomfort or psychological distress.\n\n**b) Addressing Ethical Concerns**\nInformed consent will be obtained, detailing risks and benefits. Participants will have the right to withdraw at any time. Debriefing and support will be provided post-experiment.\n\n**c) Broader Societal Implications**\nUnderstanding neural underpinnings of economic decisions may raise ethical concerns about manipulation or misuse of such knowledge. Ensuring data privacy and ethical use of findings will be paramount.\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions\n**a) Experimental Design Limitations**\nThe artificial laboratory setting and stress induction may not perfectly emulate real-world conditions. EEG spatial resolution limitations may miss deeper brain structures involved in decision-making.\n\n**b) Addressing Limitations**\nFuture studies could use fMRI to complement EEG data, providing better spatial resolution. Real-world stressors could be incorporated to enhance ecological validity.\n\n**c) Follow-Up Experiment**\nA longitudinal study tracking real-world financial decisions and stress levels, integrating wearable EEG devices for continuous monitoring, could build on initial findings and provide more comprehensive insights into the neural basis of economic behavior.",
            "**1. Experimental Design**\n\n**a) Overall Structure:**\nOur experiment will involve participants performing an intertemporal choice task while their neural activity is monitored using EEG. Participants will be asked to choose between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards. The task will be divided into multiple trials to assess decision patterns consistently over time.\n\n**b) Tradeoffs Between Immediate and Delayed Rewards:**\nThe task will present participants with various monetary choices, where they must decide between receiving a smaller amount of money immediately (e.g., $10 now) or a larger amount later (e.g., $20 in a month). This task leverages the classic paradigm of intertemporal choice, allowing us to probe the neural underpinnings of these decisions.\n\n**c) EEG Measurement:**\nEEG will be used to capture real-time neural activity during the decision-making process. Specifically, we will focus on prefrontal cortex activity, as previous research has shown this area to be crucial in self-control and future-oriented decision-making. We will also monitor changes in the theta and delta frequency bands, which are associated with cognitive control and reward processing.\n\n**d) Control Conditions:**\nWe will include a control condition where participants make similar choices without any reward to establish a baseline neural activity pattern. Additionally, a comparison group will perform a neutral task unrelated to decision-making (e.g., a simple reaction time task) to control for general cognitive load and stress effects.\n\n**e) Stress Manipulation:**\nTo incorporate stress manipulation, we will use the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before the intertemporal choice task. The TSST involves public speaking and arithmetic tasks under observation, known to induce physiological and psychological stress. We will measure cortisol levels to confirm stress induction.\n\n**f) Participant Number:**\nA minimum of 50 participants will be recruited to ensure sufficient statistical power. This number is justified based on previous EEG studies in neuroeconomics, which typically require large sample sizes due to individual variability in neural responses.\n\n**g) Game-Theoretic Approach:**\nA game-theoretic approach will not be central to this experiment but could be integrated in future studies to explore strategic decision-making under stress.\n\n**h) Novel Measure:**\nWe will introduce a novel neuroeconomic measure called the \u201cNeural Impulsivity Index\u201d (NII), calculated by analyzing the ratio of immediate-to-delayed reward choices and corresponding EEG signals in the prefrontal cortex. This index will provide a quantifiable link between neural activity and impulsivity in economic decisions.\n\n**2. Hypotheses and Predictions**\n\n**a) Hypotheses:**\n1. Participants will exhibit increased neural activity in the prefrontal cortex when choosing delayed rewards compared to immediate rewards.\n2. Stress manipulation will lead to a higher preference for immediate rewards and decreased prefrontal cortex activity.\n\n**b) Behavioral Outcomes:**\nFor the first hypothesis, we expect that participants will choose delayed rewards more frequently under non-stress conditions. For the second hypothesis, stress-induced participants will display a higher rate of choosing immediate rewards.\n\n**c) Neural Activity Patterns:**\nWe anticipate heightened prefrontal cortex activation (increased theta and delta band activity) during decisions favoring delayed rewards. Under stress, we predict a reduction in this activation due to impaired self-control mechanisms, correlating with a shift towards immediate rewards.\n\n**d) Stress Effect:**\nStress is expected to exacerbate impulsivity, diminishing the cognitive control needed for future-oriented decision-making. This will likely manifest as reduced prefrontal cortex activity and a behavioral tilt towards immediate rewards.\n\n**3. Data Analysis Plan**\n\n**a) Key Measures and Variables:**\nBehavioral data will include the frequency of immediate versus delayed reward choices. Neural data will focus on EEG signal amplitude and frequency bands in the prefrontal cortex. Cortisol levels will serve as a physiological marker of stress.\n\n**b) Statistical Methods:**\nWe will use mixed-effects logistic regression to analyze the choice data, with stress condition and reward type as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. EEG data will be analyzed using time-frequency analysis and compared across conditions using ANOVA.\n\n**c) Integration of Data:**\nBehavioral and neural data will be integrated by correlating the Neural Impulsivity Index with the choice patterns. We will also use mediation analysis to explore if neural activity mediates the relationship between stress and decision-making behavior.\n\n**d) Controlling Confounding Variables:**\nWe will control for variables such as age, gender, and baseline impulsivity (measured via questionnaire). Random assignment to stress and control groups will help mitigate selection biases.\n\n**4. Potential Implications**\n\n**a) Informing Economic Theory:**\nResults could refine models of intertemporal choice by incorporating neural mechanisms underlying impulsivity and self-control. It may lead to theories that better account for the impact of stress on economic decisions.\n\n**b) Real-World Applications:**\nFindings could inform policies aimed at reducing impulsive financial behaviors, such as payday loans or credit card debt. Marketing strategies could be designed to promote healthier financial choices by understanding stress impacts.\n\n**c) Understanding Neural Basis:**\nThis experiment will contribute to our understanding of how stress affects the brain's decision-making circuitry, particularly in economic contexts. It will highlight the role of the prefrontal cortex in balancing immediate and future rewards.\n\n**5. Ethical Considerations**\n\n**a) Potential Ethical Issues:**\nInducing stress, especially using the TSST, may cause discomfort or anxiety. There is also a risk of privacy concerns related to neural data collection.\n\n**b) Addressing Ethical Concerns:**\nWe will ensure informed consent, explaining the stress induction process and allowing participants to withdraw at any time. Debriefing sessions will be provided to alleviate any distress. EEG data will be anonymized to protect privacy.\n\n**c) Broader Societal Implications:**\nUnderstanding how stress affects economic decisions can have profound societal impacts, such as designing interventions to support individuals in high-stress environments. However, ethical considerations around privacy and the potential misuse of such knowledge must be carefully managed.\n\n**6. Limitations and Future Directions**\n\n**a) Potential Limitations:**\nA primary limitation is the artificial nature of lab-induced stress, which may not fully capture real-world stressors. Additionally, the reliance on EEG, which has limited spatial resolution compared to other neuroimaging techniques, might restrict the granularity of neural insights.\n\n**b) Addressing Limitations:**\nFuture studies could employ more naturalistic stressors and use complementary neuroimaging methods like fMRI for higher spatial resolution. Longitudinal designs could also assess the long-term impact of stress on decision-making.\n\n**c) Follow-Up Experiment:**\nA follow-up experiment could explore the role of social support in mitigating stress effects on economic decisions. This study would manipulate social support levels during the intertemporal choice task and measure resulting neural and behavioral changes.",
            "The experiment integrates economic theory, psychological insights, and neuroscientific methods to investigate how stress influences intertemporal choices using EEG. It includes a stress manipulation via the TSST, a minimum of 50 participants, and novel measures linking cortisol levels with neural activity. Hypotheses include increased immediate reward preference and altered frontal cortex activity under stress. Data analysis will use ANOVAs, regression, and multilevel modeling. Potential implications span economic theory, real-world applications, and neural basis understanding. Ethical considerations focus on informed consent and stress management. Limitations are acknowledged, with future directions proposing longitudinal studies and multimodal imaging approaches.",
            "### 1. Experimental Design\n\n#### a) Overall Structure\nThe experiment will involve participants performing an intertemporal choice task while their neural activity is recorded using EEG. Participants will make a series of decisions between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards. The task will be divided into two phases: a baseline phase and a stress manipulation phase. Each phase will consist of 50 trials, where participants will choose between two monetary options displayed on a computer screen.\n\n#### b) Addressing Intertemporal Choice\nThe experiment will use a classic intertemporal choice paradigm, presenting choices like $10 now vs. $15 in one week. The rewards and delays will vary systematically to investigate how participants value immediate versus delayed gratification. This setup will help us understand the tradeoffs individuals make between immediate and delayed rewards.\n\n#### c) EEG Measurement\nEEG will be used to measure neural activity during the decision-making process. Electrodes will be placed according to the 10-20 system, focusing on regions implicated in decision-making, such as the prefrontal cortex. Time-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) will be analyzed to identify neural correlates of decision-making processes, particularly the P300 and feedback-related negativity (FRN) components.\n\n#### d) Control Conditions\nA within-subjects design will be employed, where each participant serves as their own control. In addition to the baseline and stress phases, a neutral control task (e.g., simple arithmetic problems) will be included to account for general cognitive load effects.\n\n#### e) Stress Manipulation\nThe stress manipulation will involve the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), which includes public speaking and mental arithmetic tasks performed in front of evaluators. The TSST is a well-validated method for inducing acute stress and will be administered after the baseline phase.\n\n#### f) Minimum Number of Participants\nA minimum of 50 participants will be recruited to ensure sufficient statistical power for detecting differences in neural and behavioral responses between conditions. This sample size is justified based on power analyses from previous studies using similar designs.\n\n#### g) Game-Theoretic Approach\nWhile not central to this experiment, a game-theoretic approach could be incorporated by having participants play a repeated game where their choices affect future reward structures. This would add a layer of strategic decision-making to the task.\n\n#### h) Novel Neuroeconomic Measure\nThe experiment introduces a novel measure: the \"Neural Discount Rate\" (NDR), calculated by quantifying the neural responses associated with discounting future rewards. This measure aims to provide a direct neural correlate of individual differences in delay discounting.\n\n### 2. Hypotheses and Predictions\n\n#### a) Hypotheses\n1. Under stress, participants will exhibit a higher preference for immediate rewards compared to the baseline condition.\n2. Neural activity, particularly the P300 and FRN components, will show heightened responsiveness to immediate rewards under stress compared to delayed rewards.\n\n#### b) Behavioral Outcomes\nFor Hypothesis 1, we predict that the proportion of choices favoring immediate rewards will increase during the stress phase.

            "### Experimental Design\n\n#### a) Describe the overall structure of your experiment, including the task participants will perform.\nThe experiment will involve a two-phase design: a baseline phase and a stress manipulation phase. Participants will perform an intertemporal choice task where they choose between smaller, immediate monetary rewards and larger, delayed monetary rewards. The task will be administered twice, once in each phase. In the baseline phase, participants will complete the task in a neutral, controlled environment. In the stress manipulation phase, participants will be exposed to a stress-inducing task (e.g., the Trier Social Stress Test) before performing the intertemporal choice task again.\n\n#### b) Explain how your design specifically addresses Decisions involving tradeoffs between immediate and delayed rewards.\nThe intertemporal choice task is designed to measure the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards. By varying the amounts and delays of the rewards, we can quantify the discount rates individuals apply to future rewards. This setup will allow us to assess how stress influences these tradeoffs.\n\n#### c) Detail how you will use EEG to measure neural activity during the task.\nEEG will be used to record neural activity throughout the task. Key brain regions of interest include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), known for its role in executive function and delayed gratification, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), involved in conflict monitoring and decision-making. We will use high-density EEG caps to capture detailed temporal dynamics of brain activity.\n\n#### d) Discuss any control conditions or comparison groups you will include.\nA control group will perform the intertemporal choice task in both phases without the stress manipulation. This will allow us to isolate the effects of stress on decision-making.\n\n#### e) Explain how you will incorporate the additional constraint: The experiment must incorporate a stress manipulation.\nThe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used for stress induction. The TSST involves public speaking and mental arithmetic tasks performed in front of a panel, proven to reliably elevate cortisol levels and induce psychological stress.\n\n#### f) Specify the minimum number of participants (at least 50) and justify your choice.\nWe will recruit at least 100 participants, 50 in the experimental group and 50 in the control group. This sample size is justified to ensure sufficient statistical power to detect differences in behavior and neural activity between the groups.\n\n#### g) If applicable, describe the game-theoretic approach you will use.\nWhile this design does not explicitly employ a game-theoretic approach, it does involve decision-making under uncertainty and tradeoffs, which are central to game theory. Future iterations could incorporate game-theoretic models to further analyze strategic behavior under stress.\n\n#### h) Propose a novel neuroeconomic measure or paradigm that your experiment will introduce.\nWe will introduce a \"Stress-Adjusted Discount Rate\" (SADR), which quantifies how individual discount rates for future rewards change under stress. This measure will provide insights into the variability of economic decision-making under different psychological states.\n\n### Hypotheses and Predictions\n\n#### a) State at least two specific hypotheses your experiment will test.\n1. **Hypothesis 1:** Stress will increase the preference for immediate rewards over delayed rewards.\n2. **Hypothesis 2:** Stress will alter neural activity in the PFC and ACC during decision-making.\n\n#### b) For each hypothesis, predict the behavioral outcomes you expect to observe.\n1. **Behavioral Outcome 1:** Participants in the stress condition will choose immediate rewards more frequently than those in the control condition.\n2. **Behavioral Outcome 2:** The discount rates (k-values) calculated from the intertemporal choice task will be higher in the stress condition.\n\n#### c) Describe the neural activity patterns you anticipate seeing, and how they relate to your hypotheses.\n1. **Neural Activity Pattern 1:** Increased activation in the ACC during the stress condition, indicating heightened conflict monitoring.\n2. **Neural Activity Pattern 2:** Reduced activation in the PFC, reflecting impaired executive function and self-control under stress.\n\n#### d) Explain how the additional constraint might affect your hypotheses and predictions.\nThe stress manipulation is expected to amplify the observed effects, providing clearer evidence of the neural and behavioral changes associated with stress during economic decision-making.\n\n### Data Analysis Plan\n\n#### a) Explain the key measures and variables you will analyze from both behavioral and neural data.\nKey behavioral measures include the proportion of immediate versus delayed reward choices and the calculated discount rates. Neural data will focus on EEG activity in the PFC and ACC, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and power spectral density in relevant frequency bands (e.g., theta, alpha).\n\n#### b) Describe the statistical methods you will use to test your hypotheses.\nBehavioral data will be analyzed using mixed-effects models to account for within-subject and between-subject variability. Neural data will be analyzed using time-frequency analysis and ERPs, followed by repeated-measures ANOVA to compare conditions.\n\n#### c) Discuss how you will integrate the behavioral and neural data in your analysis.\nWe will use multivariate regression models to examine the relationship between neural activity and behavioral choices. Path analysis may be employed to explore causal pathways linking stress, neural activity, and decision-making.\n\n#### d) Address how you will control for potential confounding variables.\nWe will control for individual differences in baseline stress levels, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic status through pre-experiment questionnaires and baseline measurements. Random assignment to conditions will further mitigate confounding effects.\n\n### Potential Implications\n\n#### a) Discuss how the results of your experiment could inform economic theory or models of decision-making.\nThe findings could refine models of intertemporal choice by incorporating the effects of stress on discount rates. This would enhance the predictive power of economic theories in real-world, stress-influenced contexts.\n\n#### b) Explain potential real-world applications of your findings (e.g., policy, marketing, or clinical interventions).\nUnderstanding how stress affects decision-making can inform public policy on financial planning and debt management. In marketing, it could guide strategies for promoting long-term investments. Clinically, interventions could be designed to help individuals make better economic decisions under stress.\n\n#### c) Describe how your experiment might contribute to our understanding of the neural basis of economic behavior.\nBy elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes in economic decision-making, the experiment will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between psychological states and economic behavior.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n#### a) Identify potential ethical issues related to your experimental design.\nPotential ethical issues include the induction of stress, which could cause discomfort or anxiety, and the handling of sensitive personal data.\n\n#### b) Discuss how you would address these ethical concerns.\nParticipants will be thoroughly informed about the stress manipulation and given the option to withdraw at any time. Stress levels will be monitored, and support will be provided if needed. Data will be anonymized to protect privacy.\n\n#### c) Consider any broader societal implications of using neuroscientific methods to study economic decision-making.\nWhile this research can yield valuable insights, it also raises concerns about the potential misuse of neuroscientific data in influencing consumer behavior or financial decisions. Ethical guidelines and regulations should be established to prevent exploitation.\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions\n\n#### a) Acknowledge potential limitations of your experimental design.\nLimitations include the artificial nature of the laboratory setting, which may not fully capture real-world stressors, and the reliance on EEG, which has limited spatial resolution.\n\n#### b) Suggest how these limitations might be addressed in future studies.\nFuture studies could employ more ecologically valid stressors and complement EEG with fMRI to achieve better spatial resolution. Longitudinal designs could also assess long-term effects of stress on economic decision-making.\n\n#### c) Propose a follow-up experiment that could build on your findings.\nA follow-up experiment could investigate the role of chronic stress in economic decision-making by comparing individuals with high and low baseline stress levels over an extended period. This would help to distinguish the effects of acute versus chronic stress on economic behavior."

Additionally, a control condition will involve choices between two immediate rewards of varying amounts to control for general decision-making preferences unrelated to delay.\n\n**Cross-Cultural Comparison:**\nThe experiment includes participants from both Western and Eastern cultures, allowing for cross-cultural comparison. This setup will help determine whether cultural background influences the neural processes underlying intertemporal choices.\n\n**Participants:**\nA minimum of 50 participants per cultural group is chosen to ensure statistical power and reliability of results, based on typical effect sizes in neuroeconomic studies.\n\n**Game-Theoretic Approach:**\nWhile not a traditional game-theoretic experiment, elements of game theory are incorporated through the strategic trade-offs participants must consider (immediate vs. delayed payoffs).\n\n**Novel Paradigm:**\nThe experiment introduces a novel paradigm by integrating EEG with a cross-cultural intertemporal choice task, examining both behavioral choices and neural correlates to provide comprehensive insights into decision-making processes.\n\n### Hypotheses and Predictions\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. **Cultural Influence on Intertemporal Choice**: Western participants will prefer immediate rewards more than Eastern participants.\n2. **Neural Activation Patterns**: Different cultural groups will exhibit distinct neural activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex during decision-making.\n\n**Predicted Behavioral Outcomes:**\n1. Western participants are expected to choose immediate rewards more frequently than Eastern participants, reflecting a cultural inclination towards present-oriented thinking.\n2. Eastern participants will likely exhibit a higher tolerance for delayed rewards, indicating a long-term orientation.\n\n**Neural Activity Patterns:**\n1. In Western participants, we anticipate higher activation in brain regions associated with immediate reward processing (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex) when choosing immediate rewards.\n2. Eastern participants are expected to show greater activation in areas related to future planning and self-control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) when opting for delayed rewards.\n\n**Cross-Cultural Constraint Impact:**\nThe inclusion of cross-cultural comparison may reveal that cultural norms significantly affect both behavioral and neural responses, potentially leading to differential interpretations of delay discounting across cultures.\n\n### Data Analysis Plan\n\n**Key Measures and Variables:**\nBehavioral data will include the frequency of choosing immediate vs. delayed rewards and the subjective value assigned to delayed rewards. Neural data will focus on EEG-derived measures of brain activity, specifically event-related potentials (ERPs) and power spectral density in relevant frequency bands (e.g., theta and alpha bands).\n\n**Statistical Methods:**\nBehavioral data will be analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression to account for individual variability and cultural group differences. Neural data will be analyzed using time-frequency decomposition and ERP analysis to identify significant differences in brain activity patterns between cultural groups.\n\n**Integration of Behavioral and Neural Data:**\nWe will use hierarchical linear modeling to integrate behavioral choices with neural activity measures, examining how neural activation predicts choice behavior and whether this relationship differs by culture.\n\n**Control for Confounding Variables:**\nPotential confounders such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and prior experience with similar tasks will be controlled through covariates in the statistical models.\n\n### Potential Implications\n\n**Informing Economic Theory:**\nThe results could refine intertemporal choice models by incorporating cultural differences in time preference, suggesting that economic models should account for cultural context when predicting decision-making behaviors.\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\nFindings could inform policies aimed at promoting long-term savings and investments, tailored marketing strategies that consider cultural preferences, and clinical interventions for impulsive behaviors by highlighting the neural mechanisms of self-control.\n\n**Contributions to Neural Basis Understanding:**\nThe experiment will advance our understanding of how cultural factors modulate the neural processes underlying economic decision-making, offering insights into the neural substrates of culturally influenced behaviors.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n**Potential Ethical Issues:**\nEthical issues include ensuring informed consent, protecting participant privacy, and managing the potential stress associated with making real monetary decisions.\n\n**Addressing Ethical Concerns:**\nParticipants will be thoroughly informed about the study's aims, procedures, and potential risks before providing consent. Data will be anonymized to protect privacy. The monetary amounts will be kept within reasonable limits to avoid undue stress.\n\n**Societal Implications:**\nThe use of neuroscientific methods in economic decision-making research raises questions about the implications of uncovering biological bases for behavior, which could influence how policies are designed and implemented.\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions\n\n**Acknowledging Limitations:**\nOne limitation is the reliance on EEG, which offers limited spatial resolution compared to other neuroimaging techniques. Additionally, cultural differences might be influenced by factors not accounted for in the study, such as language or education.\n\n**Addressing Limitations:**\nFuture studies could use fMRI to complement EEG findings, providing more detailed spatial information about brain activity. Including a broader range of demographic factors could help isolate the specific cultural influences on decision-making.\n\n**Follow-Up Experiment:**\nA follow-up experiment could involve longitudinal tracking of decision-making behavior to see how stable these cultural and neural differences are over time. Additionally, incorporating other reward types (e.g., social rewards) could provide a more comprehensive understanding of intertemporal choice.\n\nBy designing an innovative and scientifically plausible experiment that integrates economic theory, psychological insights, and neuroscientific methods, this study aims to push the boundaries of current neuroeconomic research. The cross-cultural comparison will offer valuable insights into how cultural contexts shape the neural mechanisms of decision-making."

            "**1. Experimental Design**\n\n**a) Overall Structure:**\nOur experiment will involve participants performing an intertemporal choice task while their neural activity is monitored using EEG. Participants will be asked to choose between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed rewards. The task will be divided into multiple trials to assess decision patterns consistently over time.\n\n**b) Tradeoffs Between Immediate and Delayed Rewards:**\nThe task will present participants with various monetary choices, where they must decide between receiving a smaller amount of money immediately (e.g., $10 now) or a larger amount later (e.g., $20 in a month). This task leverages the classic paradigm of intertemporal choice, allowing us to probe the neural underpinnings of these decisions.\n\n**c) EEG Measurement:**\nEEG will be used to capture real-time neural activity during the decision-making process. Specifically, we will focus on prefrontal cortex activity, as previous research has shown this area to be crucial in self-control and future-oriented decision-making. We will also monitor changes in the theta and delta frequency bands, which are associated with cognitive control and reward processing.\n\n**d) Control Conditions:**\nWe will include a control condition where participants make similar choices without any reward to establish a baseline neural activity pattern. Additionally, a comparison group will perform a neutral task unrelated to decision-making (e.g., a simple reaction time task) to control for general cognitive load and stress effects.\n\n**e) Stress Manipulation:**\nTo incorporate stress manipulation, we will use the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before the intertemporal choice task. The TSST involves public speaking and arithmetic tasks under observation, known to induce physiological and psychological stress. We will measure cortisol levels to confirm stress induction.\n\n**f) Participant Number:**\nA minimum of 50 participants will be recruited to ensure sufficient statistical power.

For the second hypothesis, stress-induced participants will display a higher rate of choosing immediate rewards.\n\n**c) Neural Activity Patterns:**\nWe anticipate heightened prefrontal cortex activation (increased theta and delta band activity) during decisions favoring delayed rewards. Under stress, we predict a reduction in this activation due to impaired self-control mechanisms, correlating with a shift towards immediate rewards.\n\n**d) Stress Effect:**\nStress is expected to exacerbate impulsivity, diminishing the cognitive control needed for future-oriented decision-making. This will likely manifest as reduced prefrontal cortex activity and a behavioral tilt towards immediate rewards.\n\n**3. Data Analysis Plan**\n\n**a) Key Measures and Variables:**\nBehavioral data will include the frequency of immediate versus delayed reward choices. Neural data will focus on EEG signal amplitude and frequency bands in the prefrontal cortex. Cortisol levels will serve as a physiological marker of stress.\n\n**b) Statistical Methods:**\nWe will use mixed-effects logistic regression to analyze the choice data, with stress condition and reward type as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. EEG data will be analyzed using time-frequency analysis and compared across conditions using ANOVA.\n\n**c) Integration of Data:**\nBehavioral and neural data will be integrated by correlating the Neural Impulsivity Index with the choice patterns. We will also use mediation analysis to explore if neural activity mediates the relationship between stress and decision-making behavior.\n\n**d) Controlling Confounding Variables:**\nWe will control for variables such as age, gender, and baseline impulsivity (measured via questionnaire). Random assignment to stress and control groups will help mitigate selection biases.\n\n**4. Potential Implications**\n\n**a) Informing Economic Theory:**\nResults could refine models of intertemporal choice by incorporating neural mechanisms underlying impulsivity and self-control. It may lead to theories that better account for the impact of stress on economic decisions.\n\n**b) Real-World Applications:**\nFindings could inform policies aimed at reducing impulsive financial behaviors, such as payday loans or credit card debt. Marketing strategies could be designed to promote healthier financial choices by understanding stress impacts.\n\n**c) Understanding Neural Basis:**\nThis experiment will contribute to our understanding of how stress affects the brain's decision-making circuitry, particularly in economic contexts. It will highlight the role of the prefrontal cortex in balancing immediate and future rewards.\n\n**5. Ethical Considerations**\n\n**a) Potential Ethical Issues:**\nInducing stress, especially using the TSST, may cause discomfort or anxiety. There is also a risk of privacy concerns related to neural data collection.\n\n**b) Addressing Ethical Concerns:**\nWe will ensure informed consent, explaining the stress induction process and allowing participants to withdraw at any time. Debriefing sessions will be provided to alleviate any distress. EEG data will be anonymized to protect privacy.\n\n**c) Broader Societal Implications:**\nUnderstanding how stress affects economic decisions can have profound societal impacts, such as designing interventions to support individuals in high-stress environments. However, ethical considerations around privacy and the potential misuse of such knowledge must be carefully managed.\n\n**6. Limitations and Future Directions**\n\n**a) Potential Limitations:**\nA primary limitation is the artificial nature of lab-induced stress, which may not fully capture real-world stressors. Additionally, the reliance on EEG, which has limited spatial resolution compared to other neuroimaging techniques, might restrict the granularity of neural insights.\n\n**b) Addressing Limitations:**\nFuture studies could employ more naturalistic stressors and use complementary neuroimaging methods like fMRI for higher spatial resolution. Longitudinal designs could also assess the long-term impact of stress on decision-making.\n\n**c) Follow-Up Experiment:**\nA follow-up experiment could explore the role of social support in mitigating stress effects on economic decisions.

Participants will perform an intertemporal choice task where they choose between smaller, immediate monetary rewards and larger, delayed monetary rewards. The task will be administered twice, once in each phase. In the baseline phase, participants will complete the task in a neutral, controlled environment. In the stress manipulation phase, participants will be exposed to a stress-inducing task (e.g., the Trier Social Stress Test) before performing the intertemporal choice task again.\n\n#### b) Explain how your design specifically addresses Decisions involving tradeoffs between immediate and delayed rewards.\nThe intertemporal choice task is designed to measure the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards. By varying the amounts and delays of the rewards, we can quantify the discount rates individuals apply to future rewards. This setup will allow us to assess how stress influences these tradeoffs.\n\n#### c) Detail how you will use EEG to measure neural activity during the task.\nEEG will be used to record neural activity throughout the task. Key brain regions of interest include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), known for its role in executive function and delayed gratification, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), involved in conflict monitoring and decision-making. We will use high-density EEG caps to capture detailed temporal dynamics of brain activity.\n\n#### d) Discuss any control conditions or comparison groups you will include.\nA control group will perform the intertemporal choice task in both phases without the stress manipulation. This will allow us to isolate the effects of stress on decision-making.\n\n#### e) Explain how you will incorporate the additional constraint: The experiment must incorporate a stress manipulation.\nThe Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used for stress induction.

Stress levels will be monitored, and support will be provided if needed. Data will be anonymized to protect privacy.\n\n#### c) Consider any broader societal implications of using neuroscientific methods to study economic decision-making.\nWhile this research can yield valuable insights, it also raises concerns about the potential misuse of neuroscientific data in influencing consumer behavior or financial decisions. Ethical guidelines and regulations should be established to prevent exploitation.\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions\n\n#### a) Acknowledge potential limitations of your experimental design.\nLimitations include the artificial nature of the laboratory setting, which may not fully capture real-world stressors, and the reliance on EEG, which has limited spatial resolution.\n\n#### b) Suggest how these limitations might be addressed in future studies.\nFuture studies could employ more ecologically valid stressors and complement EEG with fMRI to achieve better spatial resolution. Longitudinal designs could also assess long-term effects of stress on economic decision-making.\n\n#### c) Propose a follow-up experiment that could build on your findings.\nA follow-up experiment could investigate the role of chronic stress in economic decision-making by comparing individuals with high and low baseline stress levels over an extended period.

The choices will be presented on a computer screen, and participants will make their selections using a keyboard.\n\n**Task Description:**\nParticipants will be presented with pairs of monetary choices: an immediate reward available today and a delayed reward available after a specified period (e.g., 1 week, 1 month, 6 months). Each trial will vary in the amount and delay to ensure a range of trade-offs. Participants will be informed that one of their choices will be randomly selected and honored to ensure incentive compatibility.\n\n**Addressing Immediate vs. Delayed Rewards:**\nThe design explicitly focuses on trade-offs between immediate and delayed rewards by varying the amount and delay of the future rewards. This setup allows us to examine how different cultural backgrounds influence the valuation of immediate versus delayed gratification.\n\n**EEG Measurement:**\nEEG will be used to measure neural activity during the decision-making process. EEG electrodes will be placed on the scalp to record brain activity, focusing on regions associated with decision-making, such as the prefrontal cortex. The timing of neural activation will be analyzed in relation to the presentation of choices and the moment of decision.\n\n**Control Conditions and Comparison Groups:**\nEach cultural group serves as a comparison for the other. Additionally, a control condition will involve choices between two immediate rewards of varying amounts to control for general decision-making preferences unrelated to delay.\n\n**Cross-Cultural Comparison:**\nThe experiment includes participants from both Western and Eastern cultures, allowing for cross-cultural comparison. This setup will help determine whether cultural background influences the neural processes underlying intertemporal choices.\n\n**Participants:**\nA minimum of 50 participants per cultural group is chosen to ensure statistical power and reliability of results, based on typical effect sizes in neuroeconomic studies.\n\n**Game-Theoretic Approach:**\nWhile not a traditional game-theoretic experiment, elements of game theory are incorporated through the strategic trade-offs participants must consider (immediate vs. delayed payoffs).\n\n**Novel Paradigm:**\nThe experiment introduces a novel paradigm by integrating EEG with a cross-cultural intertemporal choice task, examining both behavioral choices and neural correlates to provide comprehensive insights into decision-making processes.\n\n### Hypotheses and Predictions\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n1. **Cultural Influence on Intertemporal Choice**: Western participants will prefer immediate rewards more than Eastern participants.\n2. **Neural Activation Patterns**: Different cultural groups will exhibit distinct neural activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex during decision-making.\n\n**Predicted Behavioral Outcomes:**\n1. Western participants are expected to choose immediate rewards more frequently than Eastern participants, reflecting a cultural inclination towards present-oriented thinking.\n2. Eastern participants will likely exhibit a higher tolerance for delayed rewards, indicating a long-term orientation.\n\n**Neural Activity Patterns:**\n1. In Western participants, we anticipate higher activation in brain regions associated with immediate reward processing (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex) when choosing immediate rewards.\n2. Eastern participants are expected to show greater activation in areas related to future planning and self-control (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) when opting for delayed rewards.\n\n**Cross-Cultural Constraint Impact:**\nThe inclusion of cross-cultural comparison may reveal that cultural norms significantly affect both behavioral and neural responses, potentially leading to differential interpretations of delay discounting across cultures.\n\n### Data Analysis Plan\n\n**Key Measures and Variables:**\nBehavioral data will include the frequency of choosing immediate vs. delayed rewards and the subjective value assigned to delayed rewards. Neural data will focus on EEG-derived measures of brain activity, specifically event-related potentials (ERPs) and power spectral density in relevant frequency bands (e.g., theta and alpha bands).\n\n**Statistical Methods:**\nBehavioral data will be analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression to account for individual variability and cultural group differences. Neural data will be analyzed using time-frequency decomposition and ERP analysis to identify significant differences in brain activity patterns between cultural groups.\n\n**Integration of Behavioral and Neural Data:**\nWe will use hierarchical linear modeling to integrate behavioral choices with neural activity measures, examining how neural activation predicts choice behavior and whether this relationship differs by culture.\n\n**Control for Confounding Variables:**\nPotential confounders such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and prior experience with similar tasks will be controlled through covariates in the statistical models.\n\n### Potential Implications\n\n**Informing Economic Theory:**\nThe results could refine intertemporal choice models by incorporating cultural differences in time preference, suggesting that economic models should account for cultural context when predicting decision-making behaviors.\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\nFindings could inform policies aimed at promoting long-term savings and investments, tailored marketing strategies that consider cultural preferences, and clinical interventions for impulsive behaviors by highlighting the neural mechanisms of self-control.\n\n**Contributions to Neural Basis Understanding:**\nThe experiment will advance our understanding of how cultural factors modulate the neural processes underlying economic decision-making, offering insights into the neural substrates of culturally influenced behaviors.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n**Potential Ethical Issues:**\nEthical issues include ensuring informed consent, protecting participant privacy, and managing the potential stress associated with making real monetary decisions.\n\n**Addressing Ethical Concerns:**\nParticipants will be thoroughly informed about the study's aims, procedures, and potential risks before providing consent. Data will be anonymized to protect privacy. The monetary amounts will be kept within reasonable limits to avoid undue stress.\n\n**Societal Implications:**\nThe use of neuroscientific methods in economic decision-making research raises questions about the implications of uncovering biological bases for behavior, which could influence how policies are designed and implemented.\n\n### Limitations and Future Directions\n\n**Acknowledging Limitations:**\nOne limitation is the reliance on EEG, which offers limited spatial resolution compared to other neuroimaging techniques. Additionally, cultural differences might be influenced by factors not accounted for in the study, such as language or education.\n\n**Addressing Limitations:**\nFuture studies could use fMRI to complement EEG findings, providing more detailed spatial information about brain activity. Including a broader range of demographic factors could help isolate the specific cultural influences on decision-making.\n\n**Follow-Up Experiment:**\nA follow-up experiment could involve longitudinal tracking of decision-making behavior to see how stable these cultural and neural differences are over time. Additionally, incorporating other reward types (e.g., social rewards) could provide a more comprehensive understanding of intertemporal choice.\n\nBy designing an innovative and scientifically plausible experiment that integrates economic theory, psychological insights, and neuroscientific methods, this study aims to push the boundaries of current neuroeconomic research. The cross-cultural comparison will offer valuable insights into how cultural contexts shape the neural mechanisms of decision-making."
