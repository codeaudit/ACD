The architecture diagram should be included as a separate, clearly labeled section after the main text.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of quantum physics, biology, and artificial intelligence\",\n            \"The proposed architecture is innovative and plausibly incorporates quantum principles into biological modeling\",\n            \"The explanation is clear, well-structured, and uses appropriate technical terminology\",\n            \"The response addresses all required sections comprehensively\",\n            \"The proposed system demonstrates creative problem-solving while maintaining scientific plausibility\",\n            \"The response critically analyzes the ethical implications and limitations of the proposed system\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family's description and the capabilities of current large language models (LLMs), let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: This task requires deep knowledge in multiple complex fields: quantum physics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. Current LLMs have access to vast amounts of information, but integrating and applying interdisciplinary knowledge at a high level is challenging.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Designing a neural network architecture, especially one inspired by quantum principles, requires not just understanding existing knowledge but also creatively synthesizing new solutions. While LLMs can generate creative text, the complexity and novelty of quantum-inspired neural networks make this a particularly tough challenge.\n\n3. **Application of Quantum Concepts**: Quantum mechanics is a highly specialized field, and incorporating its principles accurately into a neural network model for biological systems is non-trivial. The concept of superposition, for example, must be correctly understood and applied in a meaningful way.\n\n4. **Very Difficult Task**: The estimated human difficulty is labeled as \"very difficult,\" indicating that even experts would struggle with this task. This sets a high bar for the LLM's performance.\n\n5. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used for scoring. While LLMs can be good at evaluating straightforward and well-defined criteria, the complexity and novelty of this task might require nuanced understanding that could challenge even an LLM judge.\n\nConsidering these points, the agent's success in this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy. An LLM succeeding at such a high-level interdisciplinary task demonstrates an impressive capability that exceeds typical expectations.\n\nDecision: Yes"
