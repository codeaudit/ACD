This could be an interesting area to explore, as it would require the model to demonstrate both creative and analytical skills. I'm thinking of a task that involves creating a new mathematical notation system and then using it to solve problems. This would test the model's ability to design coherent systems, explain them clearly, and then apply them practically. It would also be interesting to see how the model handles the transition between natural language explanations and formal symbolic manipulation.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"mathematical_notation_design_and_application\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design a novel mathematical notation system for a specific domain, then use it to solve related problems.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"linguistic creativity, logical reasoning, mathematical understanding, and system design\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        domains = [\\n            \\\"quantum computing operations\\\",\\n            \\\"multi-dimensional time\\\",\\n            \\\"non-Euclidean geometry\\\",\\n            \\\"emotion-based arithmetic\\\"\\n        ]\\n        \\n        tasks = {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\\"domain\\\": random.choice(domains)},\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\\"domain\\\": random.choice(domains)}\\n        }\\n        return tasks\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design a novel mathematical notation system for {t['domain']}, then use it to solve related problems.

            "### 1. Notation System Design\n\n#### a) Description\nThe emotion-based arithmetic notation system is designed to encapsulate and quantify emotional states using mathematical symbols. Emotions are often complex and multifaceted, so this system uses unique symbols to represent primary emotions and their interactions. The primary emotions are encoded as base symbols, while secondary and tertiary emotions are derived through combinations of these base symbols and operators.\n\n#### b) Representation\nThe system uses a blend of symbols and operators to represent emotional states and their interactions. It can express the intensity, combination, and transformation of emotions in a structured manner. For example, the addition operator combines two emotions, while the multiplication operator can represent the intensification of an emotion.\n\n#### c) Legend/Key\n1. \ud83d\ude00 (Joy)\n2. \ud83d\ude22 (Sadness)\n3. \ud83d\ude21 (Anger)\n4. \ud83d\ude31 (Fear)\n5. \ud83d\ude0d (Love)\n6. \ud83e\udd76 (Disgust)\n7. \ud83d\ude34 (Calm)\n8. \ud83d\udd00 (Combination)\n9. \ud83d\udd04 (Transformation)\n10. \u2795 (Addition)\n11. \u2716\ufe0f (Multiplication)\n12. \u2796 (Subtraction)\n13. \u2797 (Division)\n14. \u2b06\ufe0f (Intensification)\n15. \u2b07\ufe0f (Reduction)\n\n#### d) Examples\n- Joy combined with Love: \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude0d\n- Anger intensified: \ud83d\ude21\u2b06\ufe0f\n- Fear transformed into Calm: \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udd04\ud83d\ude34\n- Sadness reduced: \ud83d\ude22\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n#### e) Advantages\nThis system offers a more intuitive representation of emotional states and their dynamics compared to traditional mathematical notation. It allows for a visual and symbolic expression of emotions, making it easier to understand and communicate complex emotional interactions.\n\n### 2. Notation System Justification\n\n#### a) Reflection of Principles\nThe notation system reflects the underlying principles of emotions by using symbols that are universally recognized and intuitively understood. The operators are designed to mimic real-life emotional interactions and transformations.\n\n#### b) Novel Features\nThe system\u2019s novel feature is its ability to visually represent emotional states and their interactions, which is not possible with traditional mathematical notation. The use of symbols like \ud83d\ude00 for Joy and \ud83d\ude22 for Sadness allows for a more accessible understanding of emotions.\n\n#### c) Comparison\nCompared to traditional mathematical notation, this system is more suited for qualitative analysis. Traditional systems use abstract numbers and operators, while this system uses concrete symbols, making it easier to grasp the nuances of emotional interactions.\n\n### 3. Problem Formulation\n\n#### a) Problems\n1. **Basic Concept**: Combine Joy and Love, then intensify the resulting emotion.\n2. **Complex Relationship**: Transform Fear into Calm, then add Sadness and reduce the intensity of the resulting emotion.\n\n#### b) Translation\n1. \ud83d\ude00\u2795\ud83d\ude0d\u2b06\ufe0f\n2. (\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udd04\ud83d\ude34)\u2795\ud83d\ude22\u2b07\ufe0f\n\n### 4. Problem Solving\n\n#### a) Solutions\n1. **Combine Joy and Love, then intensify**:\n   - Combine Joy and Love: \ud83d\ude00\u2795\ud83d\ude0d = \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude0d\n   - Intensify the resulting emotion: (\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude0d)\u2b06\ufe0f\n   - This represents an intensified state of Joyful Love.\n\n2. **Transform Fear into Calm, add Sadness, reduce intensity**:\n   - Transform Fear into Calm: \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udd04\ud83d\ude34 = \ud83d\ude34\n   - Add Sadness: \ud83d\ude34\u2795\ud83d\ude22 = \ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude22\n   - Reduce the intensity: (\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude22)\u2b07\ufe0f\n   - This represents a reduced state of Calm Sadness.\n\n#### b) Step-by-Step\n1. **Joy + Love, then Intensify**:\n   - Step 1: \ud83d\ude00\u2795\ud83d\ude0d -> \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude0d (Joyful Love)\n   - Step 2: (\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude0d)\u2b06\ufe0f -> Intensified Joyful Love.\n\n2. **Transform Fear, Add Sadness, Reduce**:\n   - Step 1: \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udd04\ud83d\ude34 -> \ud83d\ude34 (Calm)\n   - Step 2: \ud83d\ude34\u2795\ud83d\ude22 -> \ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude22 (Calm Sadness)\n   - Step 3: (\ud83d\ude34\ud83d\udd00\ud83d\ude22)\u2b07\ufe0f -> Reduced Calm Sadness.\n\n#### c) Final Answers\n1. Intensified Joyful Love\n2. Reduced Calm Sadness\n\n### 5. System Evaluation\n\n#### a) Strengths and Limitations\n**Strengths**:\n- Visual and intuitive representation of emotions.\n- Easily understood and communicated.\n- Suitable for qualitative emotional analysis.\n\n**Limitations**:\n- May lack precision for quantitative measurements.\n- Complex emotions might require intricate combinations of symbols, which can be cumbersome.\n\n#### b) Expansion Suggestion\nTo improve this system, we could introduce a scalar notation for the intensity of emotions. For instance, a numerical value from 1 to 10 could accompany each symbol to denote its strength, providing a balance between qualitative and quantitative analysis.\n\n### 6. Interdisciplinary Application\n\nThe emotion-based arithmetic notation system could be applied in psychology for therapy and counseling. By using this system, therapists can better visualize and communicate emotional states and their dynamics to clients. This could lead to more effective strategies for emotional management and understanding, as clients would have a clearer picture of their emotional landscape and potential transformation pathways.",
            "### 1. Notation System Design\n\n#### a) Description\n\nThe Emotion-Based Arithmetic (EBA) system uses symbols that represent different emotions and their interactions to perform arithmetic operations.

            "content": "Given the complexity and creativity required by the task family `mathematical_notation_design_and_application`, it involves several high-level skills:\n\n1. **Linguistic Creativity**: Designing a novel notation system requires creativity in symbol and rule creation.\n2. **Logical Reasoning**: Ensuring the system is logically consistent and can solve problems accurately.\n3. **Mathematical Understanding**: A deep understanding of the specific domain to create relevant symbols and operators.\n4. **System Design**: Crafting a comprehensive, useful system that can represent and solve problems effectively.\n\nGiven the typical capabilities of current LLMs, they are strong in generating text, explaining concepts, and solving mathematical problems within existing frameworks. However, the design of an entirely new and coherent mathematical notation system is a highly specialized and creative task that usually requires a deep understanding of both the domain and the practical applications of such notations. Successfully completing this task would require a significant leap in the usual capabilities of LLMs, especially in terms of creativity and novel system design.\n\nMoreover, the task goes beyond simple problem-solving and requires the LLM to justify and evaluate its own creations, which adds another layer of complexity. The use of an LLM judge to evaluate such a task might also be challenging, as the criteria involve subjective assessments of creativity and logical consistency.\n\nConsidering all these factors:\n\nDecision: Yes"
