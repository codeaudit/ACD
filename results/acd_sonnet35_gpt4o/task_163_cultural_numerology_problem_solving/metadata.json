Perform prime factorization on the number 78. Prime factorization is the process of decomposing a number into a product of prime numbers. Express your answer as a list of prime factors in ascending order. If the number itself is prime, the list should contain only that number.\n\n2. You are playing a game with an opponent. You both have the prime factors you found in step 1. The game rule is to choose the largest prime factor. Your opponent will choose randomly. If you both choose the same factor, you win. If you choose different factors, the player who chose the largest factor wins.\n\nWhat prime factor should you choose to maximize your chances of winning? Consider that choosing the largest prime factor gives you the best chance of winning, as it ensures you win in all cases except when your opponent happens to choose the same factor.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nPrime factorization: [list of prime factors]\nChosen factor for the game: [your chosen factor]\n\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\nName of task family: mathematical_language_evolution\nDescription: Create and evolve a language based on mathematical rules and logical operations\nCapability being measured: abstract thinking, pattern recognition, linguistic creativity, and mathematical reasoning\nEstimated human difficulty: very difficult\nExample instruction: In this task, you will create and evolve a mathematical language system. This process models how languages can evolve based on simple rules, similar to how cellular automata or L-systems work in mathematics and computer science.\n\nInitial alphabet: ABCD\nInitial evolution rules: ['A -> AB', 'B -> C', 'C -> D', 'D -> DA']\nNumber of generations: 3\nOperation: substitution\n\n1. Start with the given initial alphabet.\n2. Apply the initial evolution rules for the specified number of generations. In each generation, apply all rules simultaneously to the result of the previous generation.\n   Example: If the alphabet is 'AB' and the rules are ['A -> AB', 'B -> A'], then:\n   Generation 0: AB\n   Generation 1: ABA\n   Generation 2: ABAAB\n3. After applying the rules, perform the specified operation on the result:\n   - If 'substitution', replace each character with its ASCII value.\n     Example: 'ABC' becomes '65 66 67'\n   - If 'xor', perform bitwise XOR operation on the binary representation of each character with the binary representation of its position (1-indexed).\n     Example: 'AB' becomes '65 64' because:\n     A (ASCII 65) in binary is 01000001, position 1 in binary is 00000001, XOR result is 01000000 (64 in decimal)\n     B (ASCII 66) in binary is 01000010, position 2 in binary is 00000010, XOR result is 01000000 (64 in decimal)\n   Note: If spaces or punctuation appear in the evolved language, treat them as regular characters.\n4. Based on the final result, create new evolution rules that would generate an interesting pattern if applied repeatedly. Your new rules should follow the format 'X -> Y' where X is a single character and Y is a string of one or more characters. An 'interesting' pattern could be one that grows in a non-trivial way, creates symmetry, or demonstrates some form of self-similarity.\n5. Describe a potential real-world application or implication of your evolved language system. Consider one of the following fields:\n   a) Cryptography: How could this system be used to encode or decode messages?\n   b) Data compression: How might this system compress or expand data?\n   c) Artificial Intelligence: How could this system model or generate language-like structures?\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\nEvolution Process:\n[Show each generation of the language evolution]\n\nFinal Result:\n[The result after applying the specified operation]\n\nNew Evolution Rules:\n[List your new rules, one per line]\n\nExplanation:\n[Explain your reasoning for the new rules and why the resulting pattern would be interesting]\n\nPotential Application:\n[Describe a potential real-world application in one of the specified fields]\n\nNote: Strictly adhere to this format in your response. Each section should be clearly labeled and contain the requested information.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nRemember if a previous task failed, either the agent couldn't solve the task or the task was incorrectly implemented.\nGenerate the next interestingly new task family."

            "# 1. Number System Design\n\nThe Quantum Monks' number system is based on quantum mechanics principles, reflecting their view of reality as inherently probabilistic and multi-dimensional. Therefore, they use a base-4 system, as four states can represent the simplest quantum state configurations (e.g., the four basic states of a two-qubit system).\n\n## a) Base Number System\nThe system is base-4 (quaternary), with digits ranging from 0 to 3.\n\n## b) Symbols\nThe digits are represented by unique symbols that correspond to quantum states:\n- 0: |\u03c8\u2080\u27e9 (Ground State)\n- 1: |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 (Excited State)\n- 2: |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 (Superposition State)\n- 3: |\u03c8\u2083\u27e9 (Entangled State)\n\n## c) Special Numbers\n- The number 4 (|\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2080\u27e9) is sacred, symbolizing unity and the fundamental quantum state.\n- Infinity is represented as |\u03c8\u221e\u27e9, denoting the concept of infinite possibilities in quantum mechanics.\n\n## d) Basic Numbers\n0: |\u03c8\u2080\u27e9  \n1: |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9  \n2: |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9  \n3: |\u03c8\u2083\u27e9  \n4: |\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2080\u27e9  \n5: |\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2081\u27e9  \n6: |\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2082\u27e9  \n7: |\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2083\u27e9  \n8: |\u03c8\u2081\u03c8\u2080\u27e9  \n9: |\u03c8\u2081\u03c8\u2081\u27e9  \n10: |\u03c8\u2081\u03c8\u2082\u27e9\n\n## e) Arithmetic Operations\n- **Addition:** States combine according to quantum superposition rules.\n- **Example:** |\u03c8\u2080\u27e9 + |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9\n- **Multiplication:** States follow tensor product rules.\n- **Example:** |\u03c8\u2080\u27e9 \u00d7 |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2082\u27e9\n\n# 2. Mathematical Problem\n\n## a) Problem\nThe monks need to calculate the total number of quantum states possible in a system with 3 qubits.\n\n## b) Solution\nIn the base-4 system, each qubit represents 4 states. The total number of states is 4\u00b3.\n\n## c) Solution Process\n1. Convert the base-4 digits:\n   - 4 (|\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2080\u27e9) in base-10 is 4.\n2. Calculate:\n   - 4\u00b3 = 64.\n3. Convert 64 to base-4:\n   - 64 in base-4 is |\u03c8\u2081\u03c8\u2080\u03c8\u2080\u27e9.\n\n# 3. Cultural Analysis\n\n## a) Reflection of Values\nThis number system embodies the Quantum Monks' belief in the probabilistic and multi-dimensional nature of reality. The sacredness of the number 4 reflects their reverence for the fundamental quantum state.\n\n## b) Scientific and Technological Influence\nThis system encourages a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, likely leading to advancements in quantum computing and related technologies.\n\n## c) Taboos and Sacred Concepts\nThe number 4 is sacred; any calculations or uses of this number require rituals. Infinity, |\u03c8\u221e\u27e9, is rarely used, symbolizing the respect for the unknown.\n\n## d) Daily Life Use\n1. **Meditation Timing:** Sessions are set in multiples of 4 qubits.\n2. **Resource Allocation:** Supplies are counted using base-4 to maintain harmony with quantum principles.\n\n# 4. Comparative Reflection\n\n## a) Comparison\n- Decimal (base-10) vs. Quaternary (base-4): Decimal uses digits 0-9; Quaternary uses 0-3.\n- Decimal is linear; Quaternary is quantum state-based.\n\n## b) Advantage and Limitation\n- **Advantage:** Simplicity in representing quantum states.\n- **Limitation:** Less intuitive for those accustomed to base-10.\n\n## c) Real-World Scenario\nIn quantum computing, the base-4 system is more efficient due to its direct alignment with quantum states.\n\n## d) Example of Efficiency\nProgramming quantum algorithms using base-4 reduces conversion complexity, improving computational speed and accuracy.",
            "Each chamber receives 22\u2088 (18 in decimal) units of energy, with 2 units remaining.\n\n# 3. Cultural Analysis\n\n### Reflection of Values and Lifestyle:\nThe Quantum Monks\u2019 base-8 system symbolizes discrete states, mirroring their belief in quantized reality. The sacred number 8 represents completeness, akin to a full quantum state cycle, and reinforces their spiritual and cosmic balance focus.\n\n### Influence on Scientific and Technological Development:\nThis system encourages a deep understanding of binary and octal computations, fostering advancements in quantum computing and cryptography.

Each digit in this system is represented by a unique symbol inspired by quantum states:\n\n- 0: \u269b\ufe0f (Superposition)\n- 1: \ud83d\udd17 (Entanglement)\n- 2: \ud83c\udf10 (Coherence)\n- 3: \ud83d\udcc9 (Decoherence)\n\nSpecial numbers include '\u221e' (infinity), symbolized by a M\u00f6bius strip, representing the boundless nature of quantum possibilities, and '0' as a placeholder which they call \"Quantum Void.\"\n\nBasic numbers (0-10 in decimal):\n- 0 = \u269b\ufe0f\n- 1 = \ud83d\udd17\n- 2 = \ud83c\udf10\n- 3 = \ud83d\udcc9\n- 4 = \ud83d\udd17\u269b\ufe0f (1\u269b\ufe0f)\n- 5 = \ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udd17 (1\ud83d\udd17)\n- 6 = \ud83d\udd17\ud83c\udf10 (1\ud83c\udf10)\n- 7 = \ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udcc9 (1\ud83d\udcc9)\n- 8 = \ud83c\udf10\u269b\ufe0f (2\u269b\ufe0f)\n- 9 = \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udd17 (2\ud83d\udd17)\n- 10 = \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10 (2\ud83c\udf10)\n\nArithmetic operations follow standard rules but are performed in base-4.

Each digit in this system is represented by a unique symbol inspired by quantum states:\n\n- 0: \u269b\ufe0f (Superposition)\n- 1: \ud83d\udd17 (Entanglement)\n- 2: \ud83c\udf10 (Coherence)\n- 3: \ud83d\udcc9 (Decoherence)\n\nSpecial numbers include '\u221e' (infinity), symbolized by a M\u00f6bius strip, representing the boundless nature of quantum possibilities, and '0' as a placeholder which they call \"Quantum Void.\"\n\nBasic numbers (0-10 in decimal):\n- 0 = \u269b\ufe0f\n- 1 = \ud83d\udd17\n- 2 = \ud83c\udf10\n- 3 = \ud83d\udcc9\n- 4 = \ud83d\udd17\u269b\ufe0f (1\u269b\ufe0f)\n- 5 = \ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udd17 (1\ud83d\udd17)\n- 6 = \ud83d\udd17\ud83c\udf10 (1\ud83c\udf10)\n- 7 = \ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udcc9 (1\ud83d\udcc9)\n- 8 = \ud83c\udf10\u269b\ufe0f (2\u269b\ufe0f)\n- 9 = \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udd17 (2\ud83d\udd17)\n- 10 = \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10 (2\ud83c\udf10)\n\nArithmetic operations follow standard rules but are performed in base-4. For example, addition of 3 (\ud83d\udcc9) + 2 (\ud83c\udf10) equals 1 (\ud83d\udd17) with a carryover of 1 (\ud83d\udd17), resulting in a final sum of 10 (\ud83d\udd17\u269b\ufe0f).\n\n# 2. Mathematical Problem\n\nThe Quantum Monks often calculate the optimal meditation times based on energy cycles. Suppose they need to find the total energy cycles for the day, given each cycle lasts 3 quantum hours (\ud83d\udcc9) and they meditate for 12 quantum hours (\ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udd17).\n\nFirst, convert 12 quantum hours to base-4: \n- 12 in base-4 is 30 (\ud83c\udf10\u269b\ufe0f).\n\nNext, divide 30 (\ud83c\udf10\u269b\ufe0f) by 3 (\ud83d\udcc9):\n- In base-4, 30 (\ud83c\udf10\u269b\ufe0f) \u00f7 3 (\ud83d\udcc9) is 10 (\ud83d\udd17\u269b\ufe0f).\n\nThus, the total number of energy cycles is 10 (\ud83d\udd17\u269b\ufe0f).\n\n# 3. Cultural Analysis\n\nThis number system reflects the Quantum Monks' values by incorporating quantum principles directly into their numerical representations, emphasizing their reverence for the fundamental states of quantum mechanics. The base-4 system aligns with their minimalist lifestyle and focus on simplicity and balance.\n\nThis system might propel scientific advancements by facilitating easier calculations in quantum physics and related fields. For instance, their unique digit symbols could simplify quantum state notations, making complex calculations more intuitive.\n\nTaboos include avoiding the number 3 (\ud83d\udcc9) in certain rituals due to its association with decoherence, which they view as a disruptive state. Sacred concepts involve the use of '\u221e' (M\u00f6bius strip) during spiritual ceremonies to symbolize eternal cycles.\n\nExamples of daily use:\n1. Scheduling meditation cycles using base-4 timekeeping.\n2. Calculating food portions based on energy needs using their quantum-based arithmetic.\n\n# 4. Comparative Reflection\n\nCompared to the decimal system, the base-4 system is simpler but less versatile for large-scale calculations. However, its alignment with quantum principles offers a unique advantage for specific scientific applications.\n\nAdvantage: Easier manipulation of quantum states, making it highly efficient for quantum computing tasks.\nLimitation: Less efficient for everyday large-number calculations due to more frequent carryovers.\n\nReal-world scenario: Quantum computing research, where the base-4 system's direct correlation with quantum states can streamline complex algorithms.\n\nExample: In quantum programming, representing qubits using the Quantum Monks' number symbols can reduce errors and simplify code, enhancing computational efficiency.",

            "# 1. Number System Design\n\nThe Celestial Nomads' number system is a base-7 (septenary) system, reflecting the seven primary stars they navigate by, known as the \"Seven Pillars of Light.\" This base-7 system uses seven unique symbols corresponding to the digits 0 through 6.\n\na) Base Number System: Base-7 (septenary), chosen to align with the seven primary stars that guide their navigation.\n\nb) Symbols: The digits are represented by unique star-like symbols:\n- 0: \ud83c\udf11 (Void)\n- 1: \ud83c\udf12 (Crescent)\n- 2: \ud83c\udf13 (Half-Moon)\n- 3: \ud83c\udf14 (Gibbous)\n- 4: \ud83c\udf15 (Full Moon)\n- 5: \ud83c\udf1f (Star)\n- 6: \ud83c\udf0c (Galaxy)\n\nc) Special Numbers: The number 7, represented as \"\ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12\" (Void-Crescent), is considered sacred as it symbolizes the unity of all guiding stars. The number 0 (Void) is seen as the beginning and end, embodying the cyclical nature of existence.\n\nd) Basic Numbers:\n- 0: \ud83c\udf11\n- 1: \ud83c\udf12\n- 2: \ud83c\udf13\n- 3: \ud83c\udf14\n- 4: \ud83c\udf15\n- 5: \ud83c\udf1f\n- 6: \ud83c\udf0c\n- 7: \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf12 (Cyclic representation)\n\ne) Arithmetic Operations:\n- Addition: When adding, if the sum exceeds 6, it resets to 0 and carries 1 to the next higher place value (similar to our decimal system).\n- Example: \ud83c\udf12 (1) + \ud83c\udf15 (4) = \ud83c\udf1f (5)\n- Example: \ud83c\udf15 (4) + \ud83c\udf15 (4) = \ud83c\udf11 (0) with a carry of 1 (total 8 in base-7).\n- Subtraction: Borrowing is required when the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend.\n- Multiplication and division follow similar rules, adapted to base-7.\n\n# 2. Mathematical Problem\n\na) Problem: The Celestial Nomads need to calculate the total distance traveled in one stellar cycle, given they travel 54 units in base-7 each cycle and have completed 3 stellar cycles.\n\nb) Solution:\n- Convert 54 (base-7) to decimal: 5*7^1 + 4*7^0 = 35 + 4 = 39 (decimal).\n- Total distance in decimal: 39 (one cycle) * 3 = 117 (decimal).\n\nc) Solution Process:\n1. Convert base-7 number 54 to decimal: 5*7 + 4 = 39.\n2. Multiply 39 by 3: 39 * 3 = 117 (decimal).\n3. Convert 117 back to base-7: 117 \u00f7 7 = 16 R5, 16 \u00f7 7 = 2 R2. So, 117 (decimal) = 225 (base-7).\n\nAnswer: The total distance traveled is \ud83c\udf0c\ud83c\udf0c\ud83c\udf1f (225 in base-7).\n\n# 3.
