        Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of molecular biology, information theory, computer architecture, and the specific domain of {t['processing_task']}. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts. Be creative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.

        Format your answer with clear headings for each section, numbered as above. Your total response should be between 1350-1700 words. Include a word count at the end of each section and a total word count at the end of your response.

        Note: Your response will be evaluated based on the completeness, accuracy, creativity, and plausibility of your DNA-based biocomputing system design, as well as your ability to address the specific problem and constraints provided. Partial credit may be given for responses that meet some but not all criteria.
