        return f"""Design a quantum-inspired computational model for memory formation and language acquisition, focusing on the quantum principle of {t['quantum_principle']}, the memory process of {t['memory_process']}, and the language pair {t['language_pair']}. Then, apply your model to simulate multilingual learning in artificial agents. Your response should include the following sections:

1. Quantum-Cognitive Framework (250-300 words):
   a) Explain how {t['quantum_principle']} can be applied to model {t['memory_process']} in the context of language learning.
   b) Describe how your model integrates quantum principles with established theories of memory and language acquisition.
   c) Discuss potential advantages of your quantum-inspired approach over classical models.

2. Computational Model Architecture (300-350 words):
   a) Provide a detailed description of your model's architecture, including key components and their interactions.
   b) Explain how your model represents and processes linguistic information using quantum-inspired mechanisms.
   c) Describe how your model simulates the {t['memory_process']} process in language learning.
   d) Include a diagram or flowchart of your model's architecture (use ASCII art or a structured text description).

3. Multilingual Learning Simulation (250-300 words):
   a) Describe how your model simulates the acquisition of {t['language_pair']}.
   b) Explain how the quantum aspects of your model influence the learning process for these specific languages.
   c) Discuss any language-specific challenges your model addresses (e.g., different writing systems, grammatical structures).

4. Comparative Analysis (200-250 words):
   a) Compare your quantum-inspired model's performance in language acquisition to traditional computational models.
   b) Analyze potential differences in learning outcomes between your model and human learners.
   c) Discuss any novel insights or predictions generated by your model.

5. Empirical Predictions and Testability (150-200 words):
   a) Propose specific, testable predictions derived from your quantum-inspired model.
   b) Describe an experimental setup that could validate or refute these predictions.
   c) Discuss potential implications of your model for understanding human language learning and memory processes.

6. Ethical Considerations and Limitations (150-200 words):
   a) Discuss ethical implications of applying quantum-inspired models to understand human cognition.
   b) Address potential misuse or misinterpretation of your model's results.
   c) Acknowledge limitations of your approach and suggest areas for future research and improvement.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of quantum theory, cognitive neuroscience, and computational linguistics. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations where necessary. Be creative and innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.

Format your response using clear headings for each section, numbered as above. Your total response should be between 1300-1600 words, not including the diagram."""
