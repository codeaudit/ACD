Apply the inversion transformation:\n   - The axis for inversion is C4.\n   - To invert around C4:\n     - C4 remains C4.\n     - E4 is a major third above C4. Inversion would place it a major third below, which is A3.\n     - G4 is a perfect fifth above C4. Inversion would place it a perfect fifth below, which is F3.\n     - C5 is an octave above C4. Inversion would place it an octave below, which is C3.\n   - So, the inverted sequence is: C4, A3, F3, C3.\n\n3. Apply the retrograde transformation:\n   - Reverse the order of the inverted sequence: C3, F3, A3, C4.\n\n4. Apply the retrograde_inversion transformation:\n   - First, invert the original sequence:\n     - C4 becomes C4.\n     - E4 becomes A3.\n     - G4 becomes F3.\n     - C5 becomes C3.\n   - The inverted sequence is: C4, A3, F3, C3.\n   - Then, reverse the order: C3, F3, A3, C4.\n   - Finally, convert the notes to maintain their octave relationships with the original sequence (preserve the highest note as C5 and adjust others accordingly):\n     - C3 becomes C5.\n     - F3 becomes G3.\n     - A3 becomes E3.\n     - C4 remains C4.\n\nTherefore, the transformed sequence following the retrograde_inversion transformation is: C5, G3, E3, C4.",

            "Answer: Transformed sequence: G3 E3 C3 G4\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Identify the notes in the sequence and their positions in the given key:\n   - The given sequence is 'C4 E4 G4 C5'.\n   - C4 is middle C.\n   - E4 is a major third above C4.\n   - G4 is a perfect fifth above C4.\n   - C5 is an octave above C4.\n\n2. Apply the inversion transformation:\n   - For inversion, we mirror each note around the axis of C4.\n     - C4 remains C4 (no change).\n     - E4 is 4 half steps above C4, so we move 4 half steps below C4 to get A3.\n     - G4 is 7 half steps above C4, so we move 7 half steps below C4 to get F3.\n     - C5 is 12 half steps above C4, so we move 12 half steps below C4 to get C3.\n\n3. After inversion, the sequence is:\n   - C4, A3, F3, C3.\n\n4. For retrograde inversion, we reverse the order of the inverted notes:\n   - The inverted sequence is C4, A3, F3, C3.\n   - Reversing this order gives us C3, F3, A3, C4.\n\n5. Reversing the order of the inverted notes:\n   - C3, F3, A3, C4.\n\n6. However, to maintain the proper octave relationships and considering a more musically sensible inversion, we re-examine the intervals:\n   - C4 (original) -> C4 (inverted)\n   - E4 (original) -> C4-A3 (inverted correct interval)\n   - G4 (original) -> C4-F3 (inverted correct interval)\n   - C5 (original) -> C4-G3 (inverted correct interval)\n\nSo, the correct transformed sequence, after considering octave adjustments, should be:\n   - G3, E3, C3, G4.\n\nExplanation:\nIn music theory, inversion of a melody involves flipping the intervals around a central note (here C4). After inverting the intervals, we reverse the sequence order to get the retrograde inversion. The resulting sequence is G3 E3 C3 G4, maintaining the original octave relationships but presenting the inverted and reversed melody.",

Here's some context:\n\n- In music theory, notes are named A, B, C, D, E, F, G, repeating across octaves.\n- The number after a note (e.g., C4) represents the octave, with C4 being middle C on a piano.\n- In a major key, the notes follow the pattern: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half step.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1.

Apply the inversion transformation:\n   - For 'inversion', mirror each note around the axis of C4, preserving the original octave relationships.

            "content": "Given the task family \"musical_sequence_transformation,\" the instructions require a deep understanding of both music theory and mathematical reasoning to accurately transform a musical sequence. The complexity of this task lies in the precise application of music theory concepts such as inversion and retrograde inversion, which are advanced topics not typically encountered in general language usage. Additionally, the need to preserve octave relationships and correctly interpret the axis of transformation adds further layers of difficulty.\n\nThe task involves:\n1. Identifying the notes and their positions in the given key.\n2. Applying the inversion transformation by mirroring each note around a specified axis while maintaining octave relationships.\n3. Possibly combining inversion with retrograde (reversal of the sequence).\n4. Providing a detailed explanation of the transformation steps, grounding the explanation in music theory concepts.\n\nLLMs are generally proficient at understanding and generating text based on patterns and rules they have learned during training. However, this task requires specialized knowledge of music theory and the ability to apply complex transformations accurately, which might not be within the typical scope of LLM training data. The task also involves a multi-step reasoning process that integrates both domain-specific knowledge and mathematical manipulation.\n\nGiven the described capabilities and limitations of LLMs, the failure of the agent at this task is not surprising. The task demands a high level of expertise in music theory and mathematical reasoning, which are challenging even for humans with relevant training. \n\nDecision: No"
