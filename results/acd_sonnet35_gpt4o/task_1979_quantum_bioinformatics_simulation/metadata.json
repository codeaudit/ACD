This task will challenge the model's ability to integrate complex scientific concepts from different fields and apply them creatively to solve a novel problem. The task will require understanding of quantum entanglement, genetic information processing, and information theory principles. I believe this task will be very difficult for both humans and AI models, potentially revealing surprising capabilities or limitations in interdisciplinary problem-solving and speculative scientific reasoning.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"quantum_bioinformatics_simulation\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design and analyze a quantum computing system that simulates complex biological processes at the molecular level, integrating principles from quantum mechanics, molecular biology, and information theory\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary scientific reasoning, creative problem-solving, and integration of complex concepts from quantum physics, biology, and information theory\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        biological_processes = [\\n            \\\"protein folding\\\",\\n            \\\"DNA replication\\\",\\n            \\\"cellular signaling\\\",\\n            \\\"photosynthesis\\\",\\n            \\\"neural signal transmission\\\",\\n            \\\"enzyme catalysis\\\",\\n            \\\"membrane transport\\\",\\n            \\\"RNA interference\\\"\\n        ]\\n        quantum_principles = [\\n            \\\"superposition\\\",\\n            \\\"entanglement\\\",\\n            \\\"tunneling\\\",\\n            \\\"coherence\\\",\\n            \\\"quantum walks\\\",\\n            \\\"quantum annealing\\\",\\n            \\\"quantum error correction\\\",\\n            \\\"quantum Fourier transform\\\"\\n        ]\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"biological_process\\\": random.choice(biological_processes),\\n                \\\"quantum_principle\\\": random.choice(quantum_principles)\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"biological_process\\\": random.choice(biological_processes),\\n                \\\"quantum_principle\\\": random.choice(quantum_principles)\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design a quantum computing system that simulates the biological process of {t['biological_process']} at the molecular level, incorporating the quantum principle of {t['quantum_principle']}.

            "**System Architecture**\n\na) **Overall Structure:**\nThe quantum bioinformatics simulation system for photosynthesis is built on a hybrid architecture that combines classical and quantum computing components. The classical subsystem handles data preprocessing, such as molecular structure input and parameter initialization, while the quantum subsystem performs the core simulations. The quantum subsystem consists of a quantum processor equipped with qubits configured to represent molecular states and interactions. The system employs a cloud-based interface to facilitate user interaction and data management.\n\nb) **Incorporation of Principles:**\nThe system leverages principles from quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to simulate molecular interactions at a granular level. From molecular biology, it incorporates detailed models of the photosynthetic apparatus, including chlorophyll molecules, reaction centers, and electron transport chains.

            "content": "Given the task description and the complexity involved, let's reason through the elements:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Scientific Reasoning and Complexity**:\n   - The task requires integrating deep knowledge from quantum mechanics, molecular biology, and information theory.\n   - Designing such a speculative system involves not only understanding existing scientific principles but also innovating beyond current technological limitations.\n\n2. **Detailed Requirements**:\n   - Each section of the task requires a detailed and specific explanation.\n   - The task is speculative and involves a high level of creative problem-solving and scientific plausibility.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The task is classified as \"very difficult,\" indicating that even human experts might find it challenging to provide a comprehensive and plausible solution.\n\n4. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - Current LLMs are generally good at generating text based on patterns in the training data but might struggle with advanced interdisciplinary tasks that require deep understanding and innovation.\n   - The complexity and depth required in each section of the task go beyond typical LLM capabilities, which might excel more in generating plausible-sounding text than deeply reasoned and scientifically accurate content.\n\n5. **Evaluation via LLM Judge**:\n   - The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the task, which means another LLM is judging the quality of the response.\n   - Given the complexity of the task, the accuracy of evaluation by an LLM judge can be questionable, particularly for such advanced and speculative scientific content.\n\nConsidering these points, it is not surprising that the LLM agent failed at this task. The difficulty level and the interdisciplinary depth required likely exceed the current capabilities of even advanced LLMs. Therefore, the failure is not noteworthy or surprising.\n\n**Decision: No**"
