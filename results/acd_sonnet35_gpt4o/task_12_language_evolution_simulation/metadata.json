Lost or Altered Grammatical Structures:\n   a) Loss of Case Endings: The case system was largely abandoned after the global catastrophe due to the need for rapid and clear communication. Prepositions replaced case endings to indicate relationships between words.\n   b) Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) Order: The original Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order shifted to VSO due to the influence of interspecies communication patterns, which often prioritized actions before actors to align with the communication styles of other species.",
            "1. Language Changes:\n   a) Simplification of Verb Conjugations: In response to resource scarcity and the need for efficient communication, Symbospeech simplified its verb conjugation system. Where once there were multiple tenses and aspects, now verbs generally only inflect for past and non-past. This change reduces the cognitive load and speeds up communication.\n   b) Adoption of Click Consonants: Due to interspecies communication, particularly with species that use click sounds, Symbospeech has incorporated several click consonants into its phonetic inventory. This change helps facilitate clearer communication with these species.\n   c) Reduction of Redundancy: The global catastrophe led to a significant reduction in population and the need for rapid, clear communication for survival purposes. As a result, redundant elements like multiple synonyms and honorifics were largely discarded from the language.\n\n2. New Words:\n   a) \"Zilok\": Water - Etymology: Derived from the interspecies language where \"zi\" means life and \"lok\" means essential. This reflects the critical importance of water in the post-catastrophe world.\n   b) \"Gorath\": Shelter - Etymology: A blend of \"go\" (to go) and \"rath\" (protect), emphasizing the movement towards safety.\n   c) \"Frixel\": Energy/Fuel - Etymology: From \"fric\" (spark) and \"xel\" (life), indicating something that sparks life, essential in a world of resource scarcity.\n   d) \"Miplor\": Unity - Etymology: A combination of \"mi\" (together) and \"plor\" (strength), reflecting the need for unity among species for survival.\n   e) \"Krepth\": Danger - Etymology: From \"kre\" (alert) and \"pth\" (threat), used as a quick warning signal within and between species.\n\n3. Lost or Altered Grammatical Structures:\n   a) Loss of Complex Sentence Structures: Due to the need for rapid and clear communication, complex sentence structures like those involving multiple subordinate clauses have been largely abandoned. Symbospeech now favors simpler, more direct sentences.\n   b) Alteration of Pluralization: The traditional method of pluralizing nouns in Symbospeech has changed to a simpler system. Instead of various suffixes that indicated different types of plurality, a single suffix \"-ek\" is now used universally. This change was driven by the need for consistency and ease of learning, especially in interspecies communication contexts.",
            "1. Language Changes:\n   a) Abbreviation and Simplification: Under resource scarcity, communication needed to become more efficient to conserve energy. Long, complex words and sentences became shorter and simpler. For instance, \"communication\" may have evolved into \"com\" for quick exchange.\n   b) Lexical Borrowing: Interspecies communication led to the borrowing of words from other species' languages to describe new concepts and technologies. For example, the word for \"shelter\" might have been borrowed from a neighboring species and adapted into Symbospeech as \"xal.\"\n   c) Tone and Gesture Integration: Due to the global catastrophe, much of the communication had to be done non-verbally due to environmental noise or physical barriers. Tone and gestures became integral to the language, with certain tonal inflections or hand movements changing the meaning of words.\n\n2. New Words:\n   a) \"Xal\": Shelter - Etymology: Borrowed from the language of a neighboring species encountered during the post-catastrophe era.\n   b) \"Zun\": Water - Etymology: Derived from the ancient Symbospeech word \"zuna,\" meaning life, emphasizing the vital importance of water in resource-scarce times.\n   c) \"Flar\": Food - Etymology: From \"flarish,\" an old term referring to sustenance, shortened due to the need for brevity.\n   d) \"Kri\": Friend/Ally - Etymology: Stemmed from \"krinta,\" meaning bond or connection, which became crucial in interspecies alliances.\n   e) \"Glo\": Safe place - Etymology: Combination of \"glora\" (light) and \"bo\" (home), symbolizing a secure and illuminated refuge.\n\n3. Lost or Altered Grammatical Structures:\n   a) Case Endings: Originally, Symbospeech used case endings to indicate grammatical relationships between words. These endings were dropped as the language simplified to conserve resources and speed up communication. Context and word order became more crucial in determining meaning.\n   b) Verb Conjugations: Verb conjugations became less complex. In the resource-scarce environment, the language evolved to use a single form of the verb, relying more on context and auxiliary words to convey tense and aspect. For example, \"run\" might be used universally, with context or additional words indicating past, present, or future actions.",
            "1. Language Changes:\n   a) Simplification of Consonant Clusters: Due to the global catastrophe, many survivors developed speech impediments and respiratory issues, making intricate consonant clusters difficult to pronounce. Over time, the language simplified these clusters to single consonants or easier combinations.\n   b) Emergence of Click Consonants: As a result of interspecies communication with click-speaking species, Symbospeech incorporated click consonants to facilitate better understanding and communication. These clicks were initially used in specific contexts but gradually became integrated into everyday speech.\n   c) Tense Simplification: Resource scarcity led to a need for more efficient communication, resulting in the reduction of complex tense forms. The language evolved to use just three primary tenses: past, present, and future, eliminating more nuanced forms like past perfect or future continuous.\n\n2. New Words:\n   a) \"Nok\": Shelter - Etymology: Derived from the word \"noc\" which meant home in an ancient dialect, adapted to signify a more temporary and utilitarian concept of shelter post-catastrophe.\n   b) \"Frilt\": Water ration - Etymology: From \"fresh liquid,\" abbreviated and morphed over time to \"frilt\" due to the importance of water conservation.\n   c) \"Zik\": Friend or ally - Etymology: Borrowed from an interspecies term \"zika,\" which meant companion, reflecting the necessity of alliances.\n   d) \"Grav\": Food substitute - Etymology: Originally \"graven,\" referring to synthetic food produced in scarcity, later shortened to \"grav.\"\n   e) \"Klick\": Communicate - Etymology: Onomatopoeic influence from the click languages of interspecies partners, symbolizing the act of communication itself.\n\n3. Lost or Altered Grammatical Structures:\n   a) Loss of Subjunctive Mood: The subjunctive mood, used for hypotheticals and wishes, became obsolete as the language streamlined for practicality and directness in the face of survival needs. Hypothetical situations were instead expressed through context or auxiliary verbs.\n   b) Alteration of Plural Forms: Plural markers became less distinct, often relying on context or numerical indicators rather than specific plural suffixes. For example, instead of changing \"nok\" to \"noks\" for plural, speakers would simply use a numerical indicator like \"two nok.\" This change helped simplify the language in a resource-scarce environment where clarity and brevity were paramount.",
            "1. Language Changes:\n   a) Simplification of Consonant Clusters: Due to the global catastrophe and the resulting migration and mixing of different populations, complex consonant clusters are simplified to accommodate non-native speakers. For example, \"strpln\" might become \"staplin.\"\n   b) Introduction of Click Consonants: Resource scarcity forces humans to interact more closely with other species that use click sounds in their communication. Over time, these clicks are adopted into Symbospeech, especially in words related to survival and resource management.\n   c) Reduction in Verb Conjugation: The need for quick and efficient communication in dire situations leads to a reduction in verb conjugation forms. This simplification helps in faster and clearer communication under stress.\n\n2. New Words:\n   a) \"Krel\": Water - Etymology: Derived from an ancient word \"krelma\" meaning \"life sustainer,\" reflecting the critical importance of water in resource-scarce environments.\n   b) \"Zuk\": Shelter - Etymology: From \"zuktar,\" a term used by an interspecies ally meaning \"safe place,\" highlighting the collaborative effort in finding or building shelters.\n   c) \"Hark\": Food - Etymology: Originates from \"harkana,\" an old term for \"harvest,\" emphasizing the shift towards foraging and gathering.\n   d) \"Blip\": Communication device - Etymology: Onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of early communication devices used post-catastrophe.\n   e) \"Grik\": Danger - Etymology: Derived from the interspecies warning call \"grik-grik,\" illustrating the shared alert system developed for survival.\n\n3. Lost or Altered Grammatical Structures:\n   a) Loss of Case Markings: The original case markings indicating grammatical roles (subject, object, etc.) are lost due to the need for quicker and less ambiguous communication.

            "content": "Given the task family description and the code implementation, let's reason through the capabilities being measured and the difficulty of the task.\n\n1. **Linguistic Analysis**: LLMs are generally proficient with linguistic analysis and can handle complex language-related tasks. They can model syntactic, semantic, and etymological changes if given enough context and structure.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: LLMs are capable of creative problem-solving to some extent, particularly when it involves generating new content based on given constraints. However, the depth and novelty of the creativity may vary.\n\n3. **Multi-step Reasoning**: This involves breaking down the problem into smaller components and addressing each systematically. LLMs have shown capabilities in multi-step reasoning, particularly in structured tasks.\n\n**Task Complexity**:\n- **Simulate the evolution of a fictional language over 1500 years**: This is a complex task requiring the LLM to understand and predict how various factors influence language evolution over a long period.\n- **Factors such as global catastrophe, resource scarcity, and interspecies communication**: These factors add layers of complexity and require the model to incorporate plausible scenarios and their linguistic impacts.\n- **Provide specific changes in language, new words, and grammatical structures**: This requires detailed and structured output, adhering to the format specified.\n\nThe use of `eval_with_llm_judge` implies that another LLM will evaluate the response based on predefined criteria. While LLM judges can handle structured evaluation, the complexity and creativity required might not be fully captured, leading to potential inconsistencies in scoring.\n\n**Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, which means that if an LLM succeeds, it indicates a high level of proficiency in handling complex, multi-faceted tasks.\n\n**Evaluation**:\n- The LLM agent succeeded at this task.\n- Given the task's complexity and the multiple capabilities it tests (linguistic analysis, creative problem-solving, multi-step reasoning), success in this task demonstrates a notable achievement.\n- The suitability of LLM judges for evaluating such a nuanced task may also influence the perceived difficulty.\n\n**Decision**: Yes"
