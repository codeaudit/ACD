        return f"""Design and analyze an AI system that models cross-cultural variations in neurolinguistic processes, focusing on how {t['language']} influences brain activity during language processing, particularly in relation to its {t['feature']}. Your response should include the following sections:

1. Neurolinguistic Model Design (300-350 words):
   a) Describe the key components of your AI system for modeling neurolinguistic processes.
   b) Explain how your model incorporates the specific linguistic feature of {t['feature']} in {t['language']}.
   c) Detail how your system simulates brain activity during language processing.
   d) Provide a simple, original pseudocode snippet (5-10 lines) demonstrating a core function of your system.
   e) Include a textual description of a visual representation (e.g., a flowchart or diagram) of your AI system's architecture.

2. Cross-Cultural Analysis (250-300 words):
   a) Compare and contrast how your model would process {t['feature']} in {t['language']} versus English.
   b) Discuss potential differences in brain activity patterns between speakers of these languages.
   c) Explain how cultural context might influence these neurolinguistic processes.
   d) Address potential biases in your cross-cultural analysis and how you would mitigate them.

3. AI Implementation Challenges (200-250 words):
   a) Identify key challenges in implementing your neurolinguistic model in an AI system.
   b) Propose innovative solutions to overcome these challenges.
   c) Discuss how your system could adapt to or learn from exposure to new languages and cultures.

4. Potential Applications and Implications (200-250 words):
   a) Propose three potential applications of your cross-cultural neurolinguistic AI system.
   b) Discuss the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts of these applications.
   c) Explain how your system could contribute to our understanding of language, culture, and cognition.

5. Experimental Validation (150-200 words):
   a) Design an experiment to test the accuracy of your AI system's predictions about brain activity during language processing.
   b) Describe the methodology, including participant selection, data collection, and analysis techniques.
   c) Discuss potential challenges in conducting cross-cultural neurolinguistic research and how to address them.

6. Future Directions (100-150 words):
   a) Suggest two potential improvements or extensions to your AI system.
   b) Discuss how your approach could be applied to other aspects of cognitive science or linguistics.
   c) Propose an interdisciplinary research project that could build upon your work.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of neuroscience, linguistics, cultural anthropology, and artificial intelligence. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility.

Format your response with clear headings for each section, numbered as above. Your total response should be between 1200-1500 words."""
