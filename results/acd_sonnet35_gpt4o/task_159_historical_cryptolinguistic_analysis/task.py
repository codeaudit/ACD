1. Historical Context (100-150 words):
   Describe the historical and cultural context in which this cipher was used. Explain its significance and any known vulnerabilities.

2. Cipher Recreation (200-250 words):
   a) Explain the mechanics of the cipher in detail.
   b) Provide an example of encoding a short message ("SECRETMESSAGE") using this cipher. Show your work step-by-step.
   c) Describe how to decode the message, again showing your work.

3. Linguistic Analysis (150-200 words):
   Analyze how this cipher interacts with the linguistic features of the language it was primarily used for (assume it's English if not specified). Discuss any strengths or weaknesses that arise from this interaction.

4. Modern Improvement (200-250 words):
   Propose an improvement to this historical cipher that would make it more secure against modern cryptanalysis techniques. Your improvement should:
   a) Maintain the core principle of the original cipher.
   b) Address at least one major vulnerability of the original.
   c) Consider computational feasibility for both encryption and decryption.

5. Comparative Analysis (100-150 words):
   Compare your improved version to a modern encryption standard (e.g., AES). Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your improved historical cipher in this context.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of cryptographic principles, historical context, and creative problem-solving in combining these concepts."""
