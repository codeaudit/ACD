It will test the model's ability to perform prime factorization and then use that information to play a simple game. This task is novel compared to the previous ones as it combines mathematical knowledge with strategic thinking. It's also more difficult, which could potentially reveal limitations or surprising capabilities of the model.\n\nFor scoring, we'll use the `eval_with_llm_judge` function to evaluate the correctness of the prime factorization and the validity of the game move.

Start by dividing 338 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:\n   338 \u00f7 2 = 169\n   So, 2 is a prime factor.\n\n2. Next, perform prime factorization on 169. The smallest prime number to test is 2, but 169 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. The next prime number to test is 3, but the sum of the digits of 169 (1 + 6 + 9 = 16) is not divisible by 3. The next prime number is 5, but 169 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. Next, try 7, but 169 \u00f7 7 is not an integer. \n\n3. Try 11, but 169 \u00f7 11 is not an integer.

Perform prime factorization on the number 74. Prime factorization is the process of decomposing a number into a product of prime numbers. Express your answer as a list of prime factors in ascending order. If the number itself is prime, the list should contain only that number.\n\n2. You are playing a game with an opponent. You both have the prime factors you found in step 1. The game rule is to choose the largest prime factor. Your opponent will choose randomly. If you both choose the same factor, you win. If you choose different factors, the player who chose the largest factor wins.\n\nWhat prime factor should you choose to maximize your chances of winning? Consider that choosing the largest prime factor gives you the best chance of winning, as it ensures you win in all cases except when your opponent happens to choose the same factor.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format:\nPrime factorization: [list of prime factors]\nChosen factor for the game: [your chosen factor]\n\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        return {\n            \"1\": {\"number\": random.randint(50, 200), \"game_rule\": \"largest\"},\n            \"2\": {\"number\": random.choice([random.randint(201, 500), random.choice([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29])]), \"game_rule\": \"smallest\"}\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"This task consists of two steps:\n\n1.

LLMs have demonstrated capabilities in performing basic arithmetic and understanding mathematical concepts.\n\n2. **Game Strategy**: The task then asks the agent to apply the result of the prime factorization to a game scenario, requiring strategic thinking. The agent must understand the game rules and make an optimal choice based on those rules.\n\n3. **Multi-step Reasoning**: The task involves multiple steps\u2014first performing the prime factorization and then using that result to make a decision in a game. This tests the model's ability to retain and utilize information across multiple steps.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring function uses an LLM judge to evaluate whether the prime factorization is correct, the chosen factor is valid and optimal, and the response format is correct. This introduces another layer of complexity as it relies on the LLM judge's accuracy.\n\nGiven these considerations, the successful completion of this task by an LLM is not particularly surprising for the following reasons:\n- LLMs have shown competence in performing arithmetic and understanding mathematical concepts.\n- LLMs are capable of basic strategic reasoning and following multi-step instructions.\n- Evaluations by LLM judges are generally reliable for checking the correctness of straightforward logical and mathematical tasks.\n\nTherefore, the agent's success at this task is consistent with the known capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\nDecision: No"
