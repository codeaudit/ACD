Future Research Directions (100-150 words):\n   a) Suggest two potential expansions or modifications to your BCI design.\n   b) Discuss how empirical research could validate or improve your system.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of neuroscience, linguistics, and AI technologies. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of neuroscience, linguistics, and AI as applied to {t['target_language']} acquisition\",\n            f\"The BCI design effectively addresses the learning focus of {t['learning_focus']}\",\n            f\"The system architecture includes a plausible interface with the {t['neural_target']}\",\n            \"The AI integration is well-explained and innovative\",\n            \"Ethical considerations are thoroughly addressed\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, which requires an in-depth understanding of neuroscience, linguistics, and AI technologies, this task is highly challenging. It demands not only factual knowledge but also the ability to creatively integrate these domains into a plausible and innovative design.\n\nThe fact that the LLM agent succeeded at this task is surprising and noteworthy. This is because:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: The task requires synthesizing information from vastly different fields (neuroscience, linguistics, AI) and creating a coherent and plausible design.\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**: The task is open-ended and demands creative and innovative thinking, which is typically more challenging for LLMs compared to more straightforward, factual tasks.\n3. **High Human Difficulty Estimate**: The task is classified as very difficult, indicating that even experts might find it challenging to perform well. Therefore, an LLM succeeding here is significant.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the success of the LLM on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
