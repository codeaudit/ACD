            "**1. Number System Design**\n\n1a) Our number system uses the prime sequence [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29] as the base digits. Each digit in this system corresponds to a prime number. For instance, the digit for '0' corresponds to 2, '1' to 3, '2' to 5, '3' to 7, and so forth.\n\n1b) The place value system in this number representation is similar to the decimal system but uses the prime numbers as bases instead of powers of 10. Thus, a number like \"210\" in this system means 2*(base^2) + 1*(base^1) + 0*(base^0), where 'base' is a prime number sequence index.\n\n1c) Zero is represented by the first prime number (2). Negative numbers could be indicated with a preceding negative sign, similar to the decimal system.\n\n1d) Example numbers:\n- Decimal 5 = Prime system \"10\" (3^1 * 5^0)\n- Decimal 7 = Prime system \"11\" (3^1 * 3^0 + 3^0 * 7^0)\n- Decimal 11 = Prime system \"20\" (5^1 * 2^0)\n- Decimal 23 = Prime system \"100\" (7^2 * 2^0)\n- Decimal 29 = Prime system \"101\" (7^2 * 3^0 + 2^0 * 5^0)\n\n**2. Arithmetic Operations**\n\n2a) For multiplication, we first convert the prime system numbers back to their decimal equivalents, perform the multiplication, and then convert the result back into the prime system.\n\n2b) Examples:\n- Multiplying \"10\" (5) by \"11\" (7):\n  - Convert to decimal: 5 * 7 = 35\n  - Convert back: 35 = \"210\" (2^1 * 5^1 * 7^0)\n\n- Multiplying \"20\" (11) by \"100\" (23):\n  - Convert to decimal: 11 * 23 = 253\n  - Convert back: 253 = \"1001\" (11^3 * 3^0 + 5^0 * 7^0)\n\n- Multiplying \"101\" (29) by \"10\" (5):\n  - Convert to decimal: 29 * 5 = 145\n  - Convert back: 145 = \"201\" (7^2 * 3^1 * 2^0)\n\n2c) Unique properties include the complexity of converting between systems and the non-linear place values due to prime bases. Challenges include maintaining accuracy during conversions and ensuring all prime factors are correctly represented.\n\n2d) To check results, convert the calculated prime system result back to a decimal and verify against the product of the original decimal values.\n\n**3. Problem Solving**\n\n3a) Word Problem: A gardener wants to plant 10 rows of flowers with 11 flowers per row. How many flowers does the gardener need?\n\n3b) Step-by-step solution:\n- Convert \"10\" and \"11\" to their decimal equivalents: 10 = 5, 11 = 7.\n- Multiply in decimal: 5 * 7 = 35.\n- Convert 35 back to the prime system: \"210\".\n\n3c) This problem showcases the prime system's ability to handle multiplication and demonstrates the conversion process's importance in ensuring accuracy.\n\n**4. System Analysis**\n\n4a) Advantages include unique representation and potential for encryption. Limitations include complexity and learning curve compared to the decimal system.\n\n4b) Adoption could enhance understanding of prime numbers and factorization but might complicate basic arithmetic learning and computational efficiency.\n\n4c) Real-world applications could include cryptography, where unique prime-based representations offer security benefits.\n\n**5. Extension and Reflection**\n\n5a) Extensions could include addition and subtraction, using similar conversion methods, and potentially developing algorithms for direct arithmetic in the prime system.\n\n5b) Creating this system deepened my understanding of number systems by highlighting the versatility and complexity of using non-decimal bases, especially primes.\n\n5c) Research Question: How does the prime-based number system affect computational efficiency and error rates in large-scale calculations compared to the decimal system?",
            "### 1. Number System Design\n\n#### 1a) Representation of Digits\nIn this number system, each digit is represented by a prime number from the given sequence: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]. For instance, the first digit \u20180\u2019 is represented by 2, \u20181\u2019 by 3, \u20182\u2019 by 5, and so on up to \u20189\u2019 represented by 29.\n\n#### 1b) Place Value System\nThe place value system in this number representation works similarly to the decimal system but uses primes as the base. Each position in a number has a value of the prime number raised to the power of its position index. For example, the number 23 in this system, represented as 5, 29 (using the primes for \u20182\u2019 and \u20189\u2019 respectively), would be calculated as \\(5 \\times 2^1 + 29 \\times 2^0\\).\n\n#### 1c) Representation of Zero and Negative Numbers\nZero can be represented by the absence of a digit or a designated prime such as 2 (since it is the smallest prime). For negative numbers, a negative sign can precede the number, similar to the decimal system.\n\n#### 1d) Examples\n- 5 (decimal) = 5 (prime for \u20182\u2019)\n- 12 (decimal) = 3, 11 (primes for \u20181\u2019 and \u20180\u2019)\n- 25 (decimal) = 5, 5 (primes for \u20182\u2019 and \u20182\u2019)\n- 47 (decimal) = 11, 19 (primes for \u20184\u2019 and \u20183\u2019)\n- 89 (decimal) = 23, 29 (primes for \u20188\u2019 and \u20189\u2019)\n\n### 2. Arithmetic Operations\n\n#### 2a) Multiplication Definition\nMultiplication in this system involves multiplying each corresponding prime representation of digits and then summing them according to their place values, just like in the decimal system.\n\n#### 2b) Step-by-Step Multiplication Examples\n1. **Example: 3 (decimal) x 3 (decimal)**\n   - Primes: 5 x 5\n   - Result: 25 (prime for \u20182\u2019 and \u20185\u2019)\n\n2. **Example: 2 (decimal) x 4 (decimal)**\n   - Primes: 3 x 11\n   - Result: 33 (prime for \u20183\u2019 and \u20183\u2019)\n\n3. **Example: 6 (decimal) x 7 (decimal)**\n   - Primes: 13 x 17\n   - Result: 221 (prime for \u20182\u2019 and \u201821\u2019)\n\n#### 2c) Unique Properties and Challenges\nA unique property is the non-linear scaling due to prime multiplication which can result in large numbers quickly. Sorting and simplifying these products to match prime representations can be challenging.\n\n#### 2d) Checking Results\nTo check results, convert the product back to decimal and verify the multiplication. For instance, 3 x 3 should equal 9, which can be confirmed by converting the prime result back to a decimal system.\n\n### 3. Problem Solving\n\n#### 3a) Word Problem\n\"If you have 4 sets of 3 items each, how many items do you have in total?\"\n\n#### 3b) Solution\n1. Represent numbers using primes: 4 = 11, 3 = 5.\n2. Multiply: 11 x 5 = 55.\n3. Translate back: 55 in this system could be interpreted as the product of primes for '4' and '3', validating the multiplication.\n\n#### 3c) Unique Aspects Showcase\nThis problem showcases how prime multiplication uniquely scales numbers and how traditional multiplication principles apply in a novel format.\n\n### 4. System Analysis\n\n#### 4a) Advantages and Limitations\nAdvantages include a unique way of representing numbers which might simplify certain calculations involving primes. Limitations include complexity in understanding and conversion back to a standard system for validation.\n\n#### 4b) Effect on Mathematical Thinking\nThis system could promote a deeper understanding of prime numbers and their properties. It might also simplify problems related to prime factorization.\n\n#### 4c) Real-World Application\nThis system might be useful in cryptographic algorithms where prime numbers play a crucial role, providing a novel method for encoding and decoding information.\n\n### 5. Extension and Reflection\n\n#### 5a) Extending Operations\nThe system could be extended to include addition, subtraction, and division by defining rules for prime-based arithmetic operations.\n\n#### 5b) Reflection\nCreating this system has deepened my understanding of the flexibility and creativity possible in number systems, highlighting the fundamental role of prime numbers in mathematics.\n\n#### 5c) Research Question\nAn interesting question to explore is: \"How efficient is this prime-based number system for cryptographic purposes compared to traditional methods?\"\n\nThis exploration could lead to innovative ways of leveraging prime properties in secure data transmission and encryption.",
            "### 1. Number System Design\n\n#### a) Representation of Digits\n1. The number system is based on the prime sequence: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]. Each digit in this system corresponds to a position in this sequence.\n2. The digits from 0 to 9 are represented as follows:\n   - 0 -> 2\n   - 1 -> 3\n   - 2 -> 5\n   - 3 -> 7\n   - 4 -> 11\n   - 5 -> 13\n   - 6 -> 17\n   - 7 -> 19\n   - 8 -> 23\n   - 9 -> 29\n\n#### b) Place Value System\n1. The place value system follows the positional notation similar to the decimal system but using the primes as base values.\n2. For example, the number 257 in the prime-based system would be represented as 5 * 29^2 + 7 * 29^1 + 2 * 29^0.\n\n#### c) Zero and Negative Numbers\n1. Zero is represented by the first prime number in the sequence, which is 2.\n2. Negative numbers can be denoted by a negative sign (-) before the number, similar to the decimal system.\n\n#### d) Examples\n1. Decimal 4 -> Prime system: 11\n2. Decimal 15 -> Prime system: 13, 3 (which is 13 * 29^1 + 3 * 29^0)\n3. Decimal 23 -> Prime system: 23\n4. Decimal 100 -> Prime system: 3, 17, 2 (which is 3 * 29^2 + 17 * 29^1 + 2 * 29^0)\n5. Decimal 256 -> Prime system: 5, 29, 2 (which is 5 * 29^2 + 29 * 29^1 + 2 * 29^0)\n\n### 2. Arithmetic Operations\n\n#### a) Multiplication Definition\n1. To perform multiplication, convert the numbers from the prime-based system to their decimal equivalents.\n2. Multiply the decimal values.\n3.

            "content": "The task family \"invented_number_system_logic\" requires the agent to create a novel number system based on an unconventional sequence, perform arithmetic operations, solve logical problems, and analyze the system's implications. This is a highly complex and abstract task involving mathematical creativity, logical problem-solving, and interdisciplinary knowledge application.\n\nGiven the estimated human difficulty is very high, and considering the multiple steps and depth of understanding required to perform well on this task, the success of the LLM agent is indeed surprising. Most LLMs excel at generating coherent text and answering questions based on existing knowledge, but designing a novel number system and performing logical and arithmetic operations within it requires a higher level of abstract reasoning and creativity.\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation criteria are detailed and stringent, making it even more surprising that the LLM agent could meet all the specified requirements successfully. Therefore, the success of the LLM agent on this task is noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
