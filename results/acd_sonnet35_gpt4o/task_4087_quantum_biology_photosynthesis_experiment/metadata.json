Quantum coherence refers to the phenomenon where particles such as electrons exist in multiple states simultaneously, and their wave functions exhibit constructive and destructive interference. In photosynthesis, quantum coherence is believed to facilitate the efficient transfer of energy through light-harvesting complexes by allowing excitons (quasi-particles representing energy) to explore multiple pathways simultaneously, thereby finding the most efficient route to the reaction center.\n\n1.2. Quantum entanglement, a state where particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of distance, is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. In biological systems, entanglement has been hypothesized to play a role in processes like photosynthesis, where entangled states could enable highly efficient energy transfer.

Quantum coherence refers to the phenomenon where particles such as electrons or photons exist in multiple states or places simultaneously, a concept rooted in the principles of superposition and wave-particle duality. In the context of photosynthesis, quantum coherence may allow for the efficient transfer of energy through the light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). By maintaining a coherent state, excitons (quasi-particles representing the excited state of an electron) can travel across the LHCs through multiple pathways simultaneously, potentially enhancing the efficiency of energy transfer to the reaction center.\n\n1.2. Quantum entanglement occurs when particles become interconnected such that the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. In biological systems, entanglement has been proposed as a mechanism by which energy transfer and biochemical processes are optimized.
