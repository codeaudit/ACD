Problem Formulation (250-300 words):**\n\n**a) Complexities of Pandemic Preparedness:**  \nPandemic preparedness involves anticipating, preventing, and mitigating the impacts of widespread infectious diseases. Key challenges include accurate prediction of outbreak patterns, efficient allocation of medical resources, and rapid vaccine distribution. These require processing vast amounts of data, modeling complex biological and social interactions, and making real-time decisions under uncertainty. Classical computing struggles with the combinatorial explosion of possible scenarios and resource allocations, which limits the ability to find optimal solutions quickly.\n\n**b) Suitability for Quantum Optimization:**  \nQuantum computing excels in solving combinatorial and optimization problems due to its ability to process multiple states simultaneously. Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), specifically, can efficiently estimate probabilities and expected values, which are crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. Pandemic preparedness involves large datasets and complex probability distributions, making it suitable for quantum optimization techniques that can handle these complexities more efficiently than classical methods.\n\n**c) Modeling the Problem:**  \nWe can model pandemic preparedness as an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the spread of disease and the impact on society. Variables include infection rates, resource availability, and intervention strategies. Constraints involve healthcare capacity, logistic constraints, and social behavior. The problem can be framed as a probabilistic model where we seek to estimate the probability of different outcomes and optimize resource allocation based on these estimates. This model is well-suited for QAE, which can provide accurate probability estimates and help identify optimal strategies.\n\n**2. Quantum System Design (300-350 words):**\n\n**a) Principles of Quantum Amplitude Estimation:**  \nQAE is a quantum algorithm that estimates the amplitude (i.e., probability) of a particular outcome in a quantum state. It combines elements of the Grover search algorithm and quantum phase estimation to provide more accurate estimates with fewer samples than classical methods. This makes it ideal for problems where probability estimation is critical, such as predicting outbreak patterns and evaluating intervention strategies in pandemic preparedness.\n\n**b) Key Components of the Quantum Computing System:**  \nThe system comprises quantum hardware, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, which provide the necessary quantum bits (qubits) for computation. Quantum software includes algorithms for state preparation, quantum amplitude estimation, and post-processing of results.

Your total response should be between 1350-1650 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of quantum computing principles, especially {t['algorithm']}.\",\n            f\"The proposed system effectively addresses the complexities of {t['issue']} using quantum optimization.\",\n            \"The solution is innovative yet scientifically plausible.\",\n            \"The response thoroughly addresses ethical considerations and societal impacts.\",\n            \"The writing is clear, well-structured, and within the specified word count.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given what we know about the capabilities of current large language models (LLMs) and the specific nature of the task in this task family, let's break down and analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**:\n   - The task involves highly advanced and interdisciplinary knowledge, including quantum computing principles, societal problem analysis, and the ability to creatively design and propose solutions. \n   - The estimated human difficulty is rated as \"very difficult,\" indicating that even experts in the field might find it challenging to accomplish this task to a high standard.\n\n2. **Capabilities of LLMs**:\n   - LLMs like GPT-3.5 and beyond have shown capabilities in understanding and generating text across a wide range of topics, including technical and scientific domains.\n   - However, their ability to integrate deep and specialized knowledge across multiple complex domains (like quantum computing and societal problem-solving) and produce innovative, scientifically plausible solutions is less certain.\n   - The requirement for detailed technical knowledge, creativity in problem-solving, and consideration of ethical implications further increases the complexity.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The task is automatically evaluated using an `LLM judge` via the `eval_with_llm_judge` function. This method relies on the ability of another LLM to assess the quality of the response based on specified criteria.\n   - The criteria include demonstrating clear understanding, effective addressing of complexities, innovation, ethical considerations, and clarity of writing.\n\nBased on these points, an LLM agent succeeding at this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy because:\n\n- The task's interdisciplinary and high-level complexity goes beyond typical LLM capabilities.\n- It requires not just regurgitating information but synthesizing knowledge, proposing novel solutions, and considering real-world implications.\n\nTherefore, the success of the LLM agent in this context suggests a significant capability in handling complex, interdisciplinary tasks, which is noteworthy for the evaluation of LLM capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
