            "1. Nanobot Design\na) The nanobot structure comprises a core-shell architecture, with a hydrophilic polymer outer shell and a lipid bilayer core mimicking a cell membrane. The core contains the drug payload, while the outer shell is functionalized with targeting ligands.\n\nb) The design mimics the biological cell membrane by using a lipid bilayer core that allows for selective permeability, similar to how cell membranes regulate the passage of substances. This bilayer can incorporate membrane proteins and receptors that facilitate selective transport.\n\nc) The nanobot is fabricated using self-assembly techniques. Liposomes form the lipid bilayer core, while the outer shell is composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated with targeting ligands. Nanoscale materials include phospholipids for the bilayer and PEG for the hydrophilic shell. Techniques like microfluidics and electrospraying ensure precise fabrication.\n\nd) Selective permeability is achieved by integrating channel proteins and synthetic nanopores within the lipid bilayer, which allow specific molecules to pass based on size, charge, or chemical composition. This mimics cellular transport mechanisms, ensuring only the intended drug is released in response to specific stimuli.\n\n2. Targeting Mechanism\na) The nanobot targets lung tissue using ligands that bind specifically to receptors overexpressed in lung cells, such as integrins or surfactant proteins. These ligands are conjugated to the PEG shell.\n\nb) Surface modifications include the conjugation of antibodies or peptides that target lung-specific receptors. For instance, an RGD peptide could be used to target integrins, which are highly expressed in lung tissue.\n\nc) Challenges such as off-target effects and immune clearance are addressed by using stealth coatings like PEG to evade the immune system and enhance circulation time. Additionally, the ligand density and affinity are optimized to ensure high specificity and binding efficiency to lung tissue.\n\n3. Drug Delivery Mechanism\na) The nanobot carries the drug payload within its lipid bilayer core. Drugs can be encapsulated during the liposome formation process, ensuring high loading efficiency.\n\nb) The release mechanism is triggered by specific stimuli found in the lung microenvironment, such as a pH change in inflamed tissues or the presence of lung-specific enzymes. For example, a pH-sensitive linker can release the drug when it encounters the acidic environment of inflamed lung tissue.\n\nc) Controlled and efficient drug delivery is ensured by designing the lipid bilayer to degrade at a controlled rate, releasing the drug gradually. The use of stimuli-responsive materials ensures that drug release occurs only at the targeted site, minimizing systemic side effects.\n\n4. Nanobot-Body Interaction\na) Potential interactions include recognition and clearance by the immune system. Biocompatibility is enhanced by using materials like phospholipids and PEG, which are known to be well-tolerated in the body.\n\nb) Biodegradability is ensured by using lipid-based materials that naturally degrade into non-toxic byproducts. PEG also degrades into small, easily excretable fragments.\n\nc) To mitigate immune responses, the nanobot's surface is coated with PEG, which reduces protein adsorption and recognition by immune cells. Additionally, the use of human-derived peptides as targeting ligands minimizes immunogenicity.\n\n5. Ethical Considerations and Future Applications\na) Ethical implications include concerns about long-term effects, potential toxicity, and accessibility. Ensuring thorough preclinical testing and regulatory oversight can address these concerns.\n\nb) Beyond drug delivery, this nanobot technology could be used for targeted gene therapy, where genetic material is delivered to specific cells, and for diagnostic purposes, where the nanobot could carry imaging agents to detect diseases at an early stage.\n\nc) One major challenge for widespread adoption is the scalability of production and ensuring consistent quality and safety across large batches. Addressing this requires advancements in nanofabrication techniques and stringent quality control measures.\n\n6. Performance Metrics\na) Targeting Efficiency: Measured by the percentage of nanobots that reach and bind to the lung tissue compared to other organs, indicating specificity. Higher targeting efficiency signifies better performance.\n\nb) Drug Release Rate: Quantified by the amount of drug released over time in the lung tissue, measured using in vivo imaging and biochemical assays. Controlled release rates ensure therapeutic effectiveness and minimize side effects.\n\nc) Biocompatibility: Assessed by evaluating immune response markers and histological examination of tissues after nanobot administration. Low immune response and minimal tissue damage indicate high biocompatibility.",
            "1. Nanobot Design\n\na) The nanobot's overall structure includes a lipid bilayer shell mimicking a cell membrane, an interior cavity for drug storage, and surface modifications for targeting. It measures approximately 100-200 nanometers in diameter, optimizing it for navigating through the bloodstream and reaching the lung tissue. The shell is embedded with functionalized proteins and peptides that facilitate selective permeability and targeting.\n\nb) The design mimics a biological cell membrane by utilizing a lipid bilayer composed of phospholipids, which naturally forms a semi-permeable barrier. This bilayer is embedded with transmembrane proteins that act as channels and receptors, mirroring the functionality of cell membranes in regulating the flow of substances.\n\nc) The nanobot is fabricated using self-assembly techniques where phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers in an aqueous environment.
