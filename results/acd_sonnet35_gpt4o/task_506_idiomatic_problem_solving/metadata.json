However, there are a few areas that could be improved to make the task more robust and clear:\n\n1. The instructions could benefit from a more specific desired response format for the agent, which would help in evaluation.\n2. We could add more synthetic data by including additional idiom pairs and problem domains in the `get_tasks` method.\n3. The scoring criteria could be more specific to ensure accurate evaluation.\n4. We should clarify that the agent should not simply restate the given idioms in their novel idiom creation.\n\nI'll make these improvements in the next iteration.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"idiomatic_problem_solving\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Analyze and apply idiomatic expressions from different cultures to solve abstract problems, then create a novel idiom-based problem-solving framework.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"cross-cultural linguistic understanding, creative problem-solving, and analytical reasoning\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        tasks = [\\n            {\\n                'culture1': 'Japanese',\\n                'idiom1': 'The nail that sticks out gets hammered down',\\n                'culture2': 'American',\\n                'idiom2': 'The squeaky wheel gets the grease',\\n                'problem_domain': 'workplace communication'\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'culture1': 'Russian',\\n                'idiom1': 'The first pancake is always lumpy',\\n                'culture2': 'British',\\n                'idiom2': 'Every cloud has a silver lining',\\n                'problem_domain': 'project management'\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'culture1': 'Chinese',\\n                'idiom1': 'The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step',\\n                'culture2': 'German',\\n                'idiom2': 'Who begins too much accomplishes little',\\n                'problem_domain': 'personal goal setting'\\n            },\\n            {\\n                'culture1': 'French',\\n                'idiom1': 'After rain comes sunshine',\\n                'culture2': 'Spanish',\\n                'idiom2': 'No hay mal que por bien no venga (There's no bad from which good doesn't come)',\\n                'problem_domain': 'crisis management'\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        return {str(i+1): task for i, task in enumerate(random.sample(tasks, 2))}\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Analyze and apply idiomatic expressions from different cultures to solve abstract problems, then create a novel idiom-based problem-solving framework.

            "### 1. Idiom Analysis\n#### a) French Idiom: \"After rain comes sunshine\"\n1. This idiom means that difficult times are usually followed by better days, embodying a sense of hope and resilience. In French culture, this phrase is often used to comfort someone going through a tough situation, suggesting that hardships are temporary and brighter days are ahead. It promotes patience and optimism.\n\n#### b) Spanish Idiom: \"No hay mal que por bien no venga (There's no bad from which good doesn't come)\"\n2. This idiom conveys the idea that every negative situation brings some positive outcome, even if it's not immediately apparent. In Spanish-speaking cultures, this expression encourages people to look for the silver lining in adversity. It emphasizes resilience and the ability to find positive aspects in negative experiences.\n\n#### c) Comparison and Contrast\n3. Both idioms suggest a forward-looking approach, emphasizing resilience and optimism. However, the French idiom focuses on the inevitability of positive change following hardship, promoting patience. The Spanish idiom, on the other hand, encourages finding immediate positive elements within adverse situations, promoting a proactive search for benefits. The French approach may lead to a more passive waiting period, while the Spanish approach fosters active problem-solving.\n\n### 2. Problem-Solving Application\n#### a) Crisis Management Scenario\n1. Consider a company facing a major data breach that compromises sensitive customer information. This scenario demands immediate action to mitigate damage and long-term strategies to restore trust and security.\n\n#### b) Applying Idiomatic Approaches\n2. **French Idiom Approach:** \n   - The company could take a patient stance, focusing on immediate damage control while reassuring stakeholders that this crisis will pass and the company will emerge stronger. Public communication would emphasize future improvements and long-term security measures.\n   - **Strengths:** Promotes calm and stability, reducing panic among stakeholders.\n   - **Weaknesses:** May be perceived as passive, potentially delaying immediate corrective actions.\n\n3. **Spanish Idiom Approach:**\n   - The company could actively look for positive outcomes from the crisis, such as identifying weaknesses in their system that can now be strengthened. They might also highlight any immediate actions taken to improve security and prevent future breaches.\n   - **Strengths:** Encourages proactive problem-solving and immediate improvements, fostering a positive narrative.\n   - **Weaknesses:** May downplay the severity of the crisis, leading to insufficient focus on immediate damage control.\n\n### 3. Cultural Synthesis\n#### a) Novel Problem-Solving Strategy\n1. A combined strategy could involve both immediate actions to mitigate current issues and a focus on long-term improvements. This approach would manage the crisis efficiently while communicating a vision of a more secure future.\n\n#### b) Bridging Cultural Perspectives\n2. This synthesized approach blends the French emphasis on future optimism with the Spanish focus on immediate positive outcomes. It encourages a balanced perspective that values both immediate action and long-term resilience.\n\n#### c) Implementation Challenges\n3. Implementing this approach across cultures may face challenges such as differing perceptions of urgency and optimism. It requires clear communication strategies that respect cultural nuances and address immediate concerns while fostering a hopeful outlook.\n\n### 4. Novel Idiom Creation\n#### a) New Idiom\n1. \"From the storm, we build stronger shelters.\"\n\n#### b) Meaning and Cultural Insights\n2. This idiom reflects the idea that facing and overcoming adversity can lead to building stronger, more resilient systems. It encapsulates both the immediate proactive response to crises (building shelters) and the long-term benefit of improved resilience (stronger shelters).\n\n#### c) Application Example\n3. In the context of public health, after an epidemic outbreak, this idiom could be used to encourage the strengthening of healthcare systems and preventative measures. It suggests that the experience of the outbreak will lead to better preparedness and response capabilities in the future.\n\n### 5. Framework Development\n#### a) General Framework\n1. **Identify the Problem:** Clearly define the issue at hand.\n2. **Cultural Analysis:** Understand the cultural context and relevant idiomatic expressions.\n3. **Select Idioms:** Choose idioms that offer useful perspectives for addressing the problem.\n4. **Synthesize Approaches:** Combine elements from different idioms to create a balanced problem-solving strategy.\n5. **Implement and Communicate:** Apply the strategy and communicate it effectively, respecting cultural nuances.\n\n#### b) Framework Application Steps\n2. **Step 1:** Define the problem and its scope.\n   **Step 2:** Research and understand cultural idioms relevant to the problem.\n   **Step 3:** Analyze the idiomatic meanings and their problem-solving implications.\n   **Step 4:** Develop a hybrid strategy combining insights from selected idioms.\n   **Step 5:** Communicate and implement the strategy, adjusting for cultural sensitivities.\n\n#### c) Benefits and Limitations\n3. **Benefits:** Encourages culturally sensitive problem-solving, promotes resilience and optimism, and leverages diverse perspectives.\n   **Limitations:** May be challenging to integrate different cultural viewpoints, requires deep cultural understanding, and the synthesized approach may not always be applicable to all situations.\n\nAnswer:"

            "content": "Given the task family description and the code implementation, let's analyze the capabilities of LLMs with respect to the outlined task.\n\n### Task Analysis\n- **Idiomatic Understanding and Cultural Contexts**: LLMs have shown proficiency in understanding idioms and their cultural contexts, especially when the idioms are relatively well-known or common.\n- **Creative Problem-Solving**: While LLMs can generate creative responses, their ability to synthesize new problem-solving frameworks from idiomatic expressions is less predictable and tends to be more challenging.\n- **Analytical Reasoning**: LLMs can perform analytical reasoning to some extent, especially when the task involves comparing and contrasting different elements.\n- **Cross-Cultural Sensitivity**: Handling cross-cultural nuances is complex and might be less reliable, given that cultural subtleties can be difficult to encode and decode accurately.\n\n### Task Family Complexity\n- The task is detailed and involves multiple steps that require a deep understanding of cultural idioms, creative application of those idioms to problem-solving scenarios, and the synthesis of new frameworks.\n- The human difficulty is rated as \"difficult,\" indicating that even humans find it challenging to perform these tasks, especially the synthesis and framework development parts.\n\n### Code Implementation\n- The task generation is random but seems to cover a broad range of cultures and idioms.\n- The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the submission based on detailed criteria, which are comprehensive and cover all aspects of the task.\n\n### Suitability of LLM Judge\n- Using an LLM judge to evaluate such nuanced and complex tasks might not always be reliable, especially for subjective and creative elements like novel idiom creation and cultural sensitivity.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the complexity and the detailed nature of the task, the success of the LLM on this task is indeed noteworthy. It involves a high level of creative and analytical reasoning, cross-cultural understanding, and synthesis of new ideas, which are challenging even for advanced LLMs.\n\nDecision: Yes"
