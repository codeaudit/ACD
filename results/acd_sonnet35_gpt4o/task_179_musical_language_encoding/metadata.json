            "1. Musical Language Design:\n   a) The basic elements of the musical language include notes (representing different frequency ranges), rhythms (denoting timing and urgency), and harmonies (indicating the complexity and multi-dimensional aspects of data). Specific note sequences can denote specific types of information, while variations in rhythm can highlight importance or urgency.\n   b) These elements combine by using distinct melodies for different data types, harmonies to layer multiple streams of information, and rhythm changes to emphasize critical points. For example, an ascending scale could indicate increasing values, while a descending scale could indicate decreasing values.\n   c) This design addresses low visibility as sound travels well underwater, and is non-invasive since it doesn't interfere with marine life significantly. The use of musical notes ensures that the system is distinguishable and can be easily decoded with the appropriate equipment.\n\n2. Encoding System:\n   a) Information is encoded using specific melodies for different data types (e.g., temperature, pH levels, biodiversity counts). Harmonic layers can represent concurrent data streams, and rhythmic patterns can indicate temporal changes or urgency.\n   b) Example 1: A rising C major scale could represent increasing water temperature. Example 2: A rhythmic pattern of quick, sharp notes could indicate a sudden drop in pH levels.\n   \n3. Decoding Process:\n   Receivers interpret the musical language through specialized hydrophones and software that analyze the frequency, rhythm, and harmony. The software translates these musical elements into readable data points. For instance, a sequence of rising notes could be mapped to a temperature increase, and specific harmonies could be decoded to show different data streams simultaneously.\n\n4. Problem Solution:\n   a) To alert biologists about changes in coral reef health, the system would encode information about factors like temperature, pH, and biodiversity in distinct musical motifs. For example, a melody in a minor key could represent deteriorating health conditions.\n   b) Musical script: \u201cA minor chord progression (indicating concern), followed by a rising chromatic scale (temperature increase), a sequence of staccato notes (pH drop), and a dissonant harmony (reduced biodiversity).\u201d\n   c) Challenges include ensuring the sound does not disrupt marine life. This is addressed by using frequencies that are less intrusive and by timing transmissions to avoid peak marine activity periods.\n\n5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications:\n   The musical language system could enhance cognitive processing by leveraging the brain\u2019s natural ability to recognize patterns in music, potentially leading to quicker data assimilation. Benefits include the intuitive nature of music and its ability to convey complex information succinctly. Drawbacks might include the initial learning curve and the potential for misinterpretation in noisy environments. However, with proper training and robust decoding software, these issues can be mitigated. The system encourages a multi-sensory approach to data interpretation, potentially improving engagement and retention of information.",
            "1. Musical Language Design:\n   a) The basic elements of our musical language include notes (pitch), rhythms (duration), and harmonies (chords). We use a pentatonic scale for simplicity and distinctiveness, and rhythm patterns based on traditional morse code variations to encode information. Harmonies provide contextual background and can indicate the type or urgency of the message.\n   b) Notes represent specific data points, with higher pitches corresponding to higher values (e.g., temperature) and lower pitches to lower values. Rhythms denote the type of data (e.g., long-held notes for continuous variables like temperature, staccato for discrete events like fish sightings). Harmonies offer additional context, such as major chords for normal conditions and minor chords for alerts.\n   c) This design addresses the constraints of low visibility and non-invasive communication by using sound, which travels well underwater and can be detected by hydrophones without disturbing the ecosystem.\n\n2. Encoding System:\n   a) Different types of information are encoded using pitch, rhythm, and harmony. Environmental parameters like temperature and pH are represented by pitches within a defined range, while events like fish migration are indicated by specific rhythmic patterns. Harmonies provide context, such as indicating normalcy or alert status.\n   b) Example 1: A rise in water temperature might be represented by a sequence of increasing pitches. Example 2: An alert for a sudden drop in pH could be a minor chord followed by a rapid sequence of low-pitched, staccato notes.\n\n3. Decoding Process:\n   The receiver uses a hydrophone to capture the musical signals. A software algorithm analyzes the pitch, rhythm, and harmony to decode the information. Pitches are mapped to specific data values, rhythms to data types, and harmonies to context. The algorithm then translates the musical data into a readable format for marine biologists, such as graphs or alerts.\n\n4. Problem Solution:\n   a) To alert marine biologists about changes in coral reef health, we encode parameters like water temperature, pH levels, and the presence of certain chemicals or organisms. We use a series of musical motifs to represent these parameters.\n   b) Musical Script: A minor chord (indicating an alert) followed by a sequence of increasing pitches (rising temperature), a rapid sequence of low-pitched notes (low pH), and a dissonant harmony (presence of harmful chemicals).\n   c) Challenges include ensuring the clarity of the musical signals and the accuracy of the decoding process. We address these by using distinct musical elements and robust algorithms to minimize errors and false alerts.\n\n5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications:\n   The musical language system could enhance cognitive processing by engaging different brain regions compared to traditional language systems. Users might find it easier to remember and interpret patterns in music. However, it could also pose challenges, such as the need for specialized training to understand the musical codes and potential ambiguity in interpretation. The system's effectiveness depends on its ability to provide clear, unambiguous information quickly and accurately.",
            "1. Musical Language Design:\n   a) The basic elements of the musical language include notes (pitch), rhythms (duration and timing), harmonies (chords and intervals), and timbres (sound quality). Each element is chosen for its distinct acoustic properties and ability to be perceived underwater.\n   b) Notes represent individual data points, with pitch corresponding to specific types of information (e.g., species presence). Rhythms convey urgency or frequency of events. Harmonies indicate relationships between data points, such as ecosystem interactions. Timbres differentiate categories of information (biotic vs. abiotic factors).\n   c) This design addresses low visibility by relying on sound, which travels well underwater. It is non-invasive, as it uses natural sounds that do not disturb marine life, and leverages the marine environment\u2019s acoustic properties to ensure clarity and range.\n\n2. Encoding System:\n   a) Information is encoded using combinations of pitches, rhythms, and harmonies. For example, a high pitch might represent a fish species, while a low pitch could indicate water temperature. Fast rhythms signal urgent changes, and specific chords could denote coral health status.\n   b) Example 1: A high-pitched C note with a rapid rhythm indicates the presence of a new fish species. Example 2: A minor chord played slowly represents declining coral health, with each note in the chord indicating specific stress factors like temperature and acidity.\n\n3. Decoding Process:\n   Receivers interpret the musical language using acoustic sensors and software that translates the musical elements back into data. The system recognizes pitch patterns, rhythm sequences, and harmonic structures, converting them into meaningful information about the underwater ecosystem. Marine biologists use this data to monitor and analyze ecosystem health.\n\n4. Problem Solution:\n   a) To alert marine biologists about changes in coral reef health, the musical language encodes data on coral stress factors (temperature, acidity, pollution) and overall health status.\n   b) Musical script: A minor chord (G-Bb-D) played slowly (declining health), followed by a sequence of notes (C-E-G) at a moderate tempo (stress factor: temperature rise), and a dissonant interval (tritone) representing high acidity.\n   c) Challenges include ensuring clarity of the message and distinguishing it from background noise. These are addressed by using distinct timbres and rhythms that stand out from natural sounds, and employing advanced filtering techniques to minimize interference.\n\n5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications:\n   The musical language system may enhance spatial and auditory processing, as users develop skills to interpret complex acoustic patterns. It fosters a multisensory approach to data analysis, potentially increasing engagement and retention. However, it may pose challenges for those without a musical background, requiring training to achieve proficiency. Compared to traditional text-based systems, this approach is more intuitive in conveying real-time changes and relationships within the ecosystem.",

Each note corresponds to a specific frequency, while rhythms are defined by specific beat patterns, and harmonies are created using combinations of notes that produce consonant or dissonant sounds.\n   b) These elements combine to create meaning through predefined patterns and sequences. For example, a high pitch may signify a positive state, while a low pitch could indicate a problem. Rhythmic patterns can denote urgency, and harmonies can provide contextual information (e.g., major chords for stable conditions, minor chords for issues).\n   c) This design addresses low visibility by relying on sound, which travels well underwater. The non-invasive nature of music ensures minimal disturbance to marine life. Additionally, the use of varied pitches and rhythms enhances detectability and differentiation of messages.\n\n2. Encoding System:\n   a) Information is encoded through specific musical phrases. Environmental data like temperature, pH levels, and presence of pollutants are represented by distinct musical motifs. Changes in these parameters are reflected in variations of these motifs.\n   b) Example 1: A rise in water temperature might be represented by a sequence of ascending notes (C-D-E-F). Example 2: Detection of pollutants could use a staccato rhythm with dissonant harmonies (G#-A-Bb).\n\n3. Decoding Process:\n   Receivers interpret the musical language through a pre-established codebook that maps musical elements to specific data points. Acoustic sensors pick up the music, which is then analyzed by software that converts the musical patterns back into environmental information. The receiver can use visual displays or auditory feedback for real-time monitoring.\n\n4. Problem Solution:\n   a) To alert marine biologists about changes in coral reef health, the system will encode data on water temperature, pH levels, and signs of coral bleaching. Each parameter will have a unique musical motif.\n   b) Musical Script: A sequence starting with a steady C major chord (normal state), followed by an ascending scale (C-D-E-F) indicating rising temperature, a minor chord (A minor) for decreasing pH, and a rapid staccato pattern (E-F-G) for signs of bleaching.\n   c) Challenges include ensuring accurate transmission and interpretation of music underwater. These are addressed by using robust acoustic technology and redundancy in musical patterns to minimize misinterpretation.\n\n5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications:\n   The musical language system could enhance cognitive processing by engaging auditory and pattern recognition skills. Benefits include faster response times in recognizing patterns and a non-verbal, intuitive understanding of environmental changes. Drawbacks might include the initial learning curve and potential difficulty in conveying complex, nuanced information solely through music.

Notes will represent different types of data points, with each note corresponding to specific predefined metrics (e.g., temperature, pH level). Rhythms will indicate urgency or frequency, with faster rhythms indicating more immediate issues. Harmonies will represent the interplay of multiple data points, such as the overall health of the coral reef ecosystem.\n\nb) These elements combine to create meaning by associating specific notes with specific data points and using rhythms to convey real-time urgency. For instance, a high-pitched note played rapidly could indicate a sudden drop in pH levels, while a harmonious chord might represent stable and healthy conditions.\n\nc) This design addresses the constraints of low visibility and non-invasive communication by relying on acoustic signals, which travel well underwater and do not disturb marine life. The audible nature of the language ensures it can be detected and interpreted even in murky or dark conditions without the need for visual input.\n\n**2. Encoding System**\n\na) Different types of information are encoded through a combination of note pitch, duration, and harmony. For instance, temperature data could be represented by a scale of notes from low to high pitch, while pH levels might be encoded in the rhythm of the notes. Harmonic structures could encode complex interactions such as symbiotic relationships or the overall health of the coral reef.\n\nb) \n- Example 1: A sudden drop in temperature might be represented by a descending sequence of notes played rapidly (e.g., C-B-A-G).\n- Example 2: Stable pH levels could be represented by a steady, rhythmic pattern of evenly spaced notes (e.g., C-C-C-C).\n\n**3. Decoding Process**\n\nA receiver would interpret the musical language by analyzing the pitch, rhythm, and harmony of the incoming signals. They would use a reference guide to decode specific notes and rhythms into their corresponding data points. For example, a marine biologist might hear a rapid descending sequence and refer to the guide to understand it signals a drop in temperature. The use of harmonies would help them understand the overall health status of the ecosystem.\n\n**4. Problem Solution**\n\na) To alert marine biologists about changes in coral reef health, the system would encode relevant data points like temperature, pH levels, and signs of bleaching into musical sequences. Urgent alerts might use rapid, dissonant sequences to grab attention.\n\nb) \n- Musical Script: A sequence starting with a high-pitched, rapid descent (E-D-C-B) to indicate dropping temperature, followed by a dissonant chord (C-Eb-Gb) to signal pH imbalance, and ending with a minor chord (A-C-E) to represent signs of bleaching.\n- This translates to: \"Temperature drop, pH imbalance, bleaching signs.\"\n\nc) Challenges include ensuring the biologists can quickly and accurately interpret the musical sequences, especially in urgent situations. This was addressed by training them extensively on the system and providing a clear, concise reference guide.\n\n**5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications**\n\nThe musical language system leverages auditory processing capabilities and could enhance pattern recognition and real-time data interpretation skills. Compared to traditional language systems, it may be faster for conveying urgent information due to its directness and ability to capture attention through sound. However, it may also require more training to understand the specific musical encodings and could be less intuitive for those without a musical background. The abstract nature of music might also pose initial comprehension challenges, but with practice, users can develop a rapid and efficient decoding process."

            "1. Musical Language Design:\n   a) The basic elements of the musical language include notes (pitch), rhythms (duration and timing), and harmonies (chord progressions). Additionally, dynamics (volume) and articulation (staccato, legato) are used for nuance.\n   b) These elements combine to create meaning through structured patterns. For instance, different pitches can represent different types of data (e.g., A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.), while rhythms can indicate the timing or sequence of instructions. Harmonies can denote complex data types or error-checking codes.\n   c) Limited bandwidth is addressed by using a compact, high-information-density system where each musical phrase conveys substantial data. Error correction is achieved by embedding harmonies that act as parity checks and using rhythmic patterns to signal the beginning and end of data packets.\n\n2. Encoding System:\n   a) Information is encoded by mapping data to musical elements. For instance, navigation coordinates can be translated into pitches, with specific rhythms indicating spatial dimensions (x, y, z). Command sequences can be encoded as melodic lines.\n   b) Example 1: Coordinates (x=5, y=3, z=8) might be represented by the notes E (x), C (y), G# (z) in a specific rhythmic pattern. Example 2: A command to \u201cmove forward\u201d could be a rising melodic line in a major key, while \u201cstop\u201d might be a held chord.\n\n3. Decoding Process:\n   A receiver would interpret the musical language by analyzing the pitch, rhythm, and harmony. An onboard system could convert these musical elements back into data by using predefined mappings. For example, a high pitch followed by a specific rhythm could signify a coordinate, while a chord progression might indicate an error-checking sequence.\n\n4. Problem Solution:\n   a) To transmit navigation instructions, I would encode coordinates and movement commands into a sequence of musical phrases. Each phrase would represent a specific instruction or set of data points.\n   b) Musical script: An ascending arpeggio (C-E-G) for initial position (x=3, y=4, z=5), followed by a rhythmic motif (quarter note, eighth note, quarter note) to indicate \u201cmove forward 10 units,\u201d and a descending chord (G-E-C) to signal \u201cstop.\u201d\n   c) Challenges include ensuring that the receiver correctly interprets the musical phrases over long distances.

Cognitive and Linguistic Implications:\n   This musical language system could enhance cognitive abilities by engaging different brain regions involved in music processing and spatial reasoning. It might be more intuitive for users with musical training, promoting efficient information processing. However, there could be drawbacks, such as a steep learning curve for those unfamiliar with musical concepts and potential ambiguity in interpretation without precise pitch and rhythm control.

            "1. Musical Language Design:\n   a) The basic elements of the musical language include notes (pitches), rhythms (durations), and harmonies (simultaneous pitches). Each note can represent a different piece of information or data bit, and rhythm can be used to structure the flow of information. Harmonies can provide context or additional layers of meaning.\n   b) These elements combine to create meaning through predefined patterns and sequences. For example, a specific melody might represent a type of instruction, while rhythmic variations can denote different parameters or values. Harmonies can indicate error correction codes or contextual markers.\n   c) The design addresses limited bandwidth by using a compact set of musical elements that can convey a high density of information. Error correction is integrated through harmonies and rhythmic redundancies, ensuring that even if part of the transmission is lost or distorted, the original message can still be accurately reconstructed.\n\n2. Encoding System:\n   a) Different types of information are encoded using distinct musical motifs. For example, pitch sequences can represent numerical data, while rhythmic patterns encode operational commands. Chords or harmonic progressions add another layer for meta-information or error checking.\n   b) Example 1: A sequence of notes (C-E-G) could represent the number '3' in a base-5 system. Example 2: A rhythmic pattern of quarter-eighth-quarter could signify a navigation command like \"adjust course by 10 degrees.\"\n\n3. Decoding Process:\n   The receiver interprets the musical language by mapping the received sequence of notes and rhythms to a pre-defined dictionary of meanings. An onboard algorithm analyzes the pitches, rhythms, and harmonies, converting them into the corresponding data or instructions. Error checking is performed by comparing harmonies and ensuring the sequence aligns with the expected patterns.\n\n4. Problem Solution:\n   a) To transmit navigation instructions, the encoding approach involves mapping each navigational parameter (e.g., direction, distance) to a specific musical motif. For example, pitch sequences can represent directional coordinates, while rhythm patterns indicate distances or speeds.\n   b) Musical script:\n      - Direction: Ascending C-D-E (represents \"North\")\n      - Distance: Rhythm of quarter-half-quarter (represents \"1000 km\")\n      - Speed: Harmony of C major chord (indicates \"20 km/s\")\n      - Example transmission: \"North 1000 km at 20 km/s\" would be encoded as C-D-E | quarter-half-quarter | C major chord.\n   c) Challenges include ensuring the clarity and redundancy of the musical motifs to prevent misinterpretation. This was addressed by integrating harmonic error correction and using distinct, easily recognizable patterns for each type of information.\n\n5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications:\n   The musical language system might enhance cognitive processing by engaging different brain areas involved in music perception and memory. Potential benefits include improved error detection and retention of information due to the structured and mnemonic nature of music.

Error correction is achieved using redundant harmonies and checksum-like structures in chord progressions to verify data integrity.\n\n2. Encoding System:\na) Different types of information are encoded using distinct musical motifs.

Your system should address these constraints: Low visibility, need for non-invasive communication.\n\n1. Musical Language Design (200-250 words):\n   a) Describe the basic elements of your musical language (e.g., notes, rhythms, harmonies).\n   b) Explain how these elements combine to create meaning.\n   c) Discuss how your design addresses the given constraints.\n\n2. Encoding System (150-200 words):\n   a) Explain how different types of information are encoded in your musical language.\n   b) Provide at least two examples of how specific concepts or data would be represented.\n\n3. Decoding Process (100-150 words):\n   Describe how a receiver would interpret and extract information from your musical language.\n\n4. Problem Solution (200-250 words):\n   Use your musical language to solve the following problem: Alert marine biologists about changes in coral reef health\n   a) Explain your approach to encoding the necessary information.\n   b) Provide a brief 'musical script' (you can use text to describe the musical elements) that would transmit the solution.\n   c) Discuss any challenges in using your system for this specific problem and how you addressed them.\n\n5. Cognitive and Linguistic Implications (100-150 words):\n   Analyze how your musical language system might influence cognition and information processing for its users. Consider potential benefits and drawbacks compared to traditional language systems.\n\nEnsure your response is creative, scientifically grounded, and demonstrates a deep understanding of music theory, linguistics, and information encoding.

Be specific in your descriptions and explanations.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The musical language design is creative, well-structured, and addresses the given constraints.\",\n            \"The encoding system is logical and can represent complex information effectively.\",\n            \"The decoding process is clearly explained and feasible.\",\n            \"The problem solution uses the musical language appropriately and effectively.\",\n            \"The analysis of cognitive and linguistic implications is insightful and well-reasoned.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, it is necessary to recognize the following considerations:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task requires not just basic linguistic capabilities but also a comprehensive understanding of music theory, linguistics, and information encoding. LLMs are generally trained on textual data and may not have extensive knowledge or the ability to create complex systems involving musical theory and its application in real-world scenarios.\n\n2. **Creativity and Problem-Solving**: Creating a novel musical language system that can encode and transmit information in a practical and effective manner, especially under specific constraints like underwater communication or deep space, demands a high level of creativity and advanced problem-solving skills.\n\n3. **Evaluation Challenges**: The task's scoring mechanism relies on an LLM judge to evaluate the responses based on several criteria. This further complicates the evaluation because it requires the LLM judge to have a nuanced understanding of music theory, creative system design, and practical application, which may not be straightforward for an automated system.\n\nGiven these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would indeed be quite surprising and noteworthy. This is because it demonstrates the model's ability to apply interdisciplinary knowledge creatively and effectively in a highly challenging context, which goes beyond typical text-based tasks.\n\nDecision: Yes"
