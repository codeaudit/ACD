            "**Biological System Analysis**\n\n**a) Key Characteristics and Mechanisms**  \nFish schools exhibit synchronized swimming, collective migration, and dynamic task allocation. Key mechanisms include local interactions where each fish adjusts its position based on neighbors using vision and lateral line sensors. Coordinated behavior is achieved without central control, relying on simple rules: alignment (swimming in the same direction), cohesion (staying close to neighbors), and separation (avoiding collisions).\n\n**b) Swarm Behavior in Nature**  \nIn nature, task allocation in fish schools involves dynamic role assignment, such as leader-follower exchanges during migration. Fish at the front navigate and find food, while those at the back benefit from reduced energy expenditure. Roles can shift based on fatigue or external threats, ensuring optimal group performance through real-time adaptation.\n\n**c) Evolutionary Advantages**  \nThis behavior offers evolutionary advantages like increased survival through improved predator evasion and efficient foraging.
