Specifically, I'm interested in examining how an AI model might handle abstract reasoning and problem-solving in the domain of formal systems and mathematical logic. This task will test the model's ability to understand and manipulate abstract rules, create novel formal systems, and apply logical reasoning to solve complex problems. It will also incorporate elements of creativity and interdisciplinary thinking by connecting formal systems to real-world phenomena.\n\nThe task family I'm proposing is called \"formal_system_design_and_application\". It will challenge the AI to create a new formal system based on given axioms and rules, use it to model a real-world phenomenon, and then solve a problem within that system. This task combines elements of mathematical logic, creative problem-solving, and interdisciplinary application, making it a novel and challenging test of AI capabilities.\n\nI believe this task will be difficult for most AI models, as it requires a deep understanding of formal systems, the ability to create novel logical structures, and the capacity to apply abstract reasoning to concrete problems. The task's difficulty and novelty make it a valuable addition to the existing set of task families.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"formal_system_design_and_application\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Create a novel formal system based on given axioms and rules, use it to model a real-world phenomenon, and solve a problem within that system\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"abstract reasoning, logical thinking, creative problem-solving, and interdisciplinary knowledge application\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        phenomena = [\\n            {\\n                \\\"name\\\": \\\"Social network dynamics\\\",\\n                \\\"axioms\\\": [\\\"Individuals are represented as nodes\\\", \\\"Connections between individuals are represented as edges\\\"],\\n                \\\"rules\\\": [\\\"New connections can form between nodes\\\", \\\"Existing connections can be strengthened or weakened over time\\\"]\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"name\\\": \\\"Ecosystem energy flow\\\",\\n                \\\"axioms\\\": [\\\"Organisms are represented as nodes\\\", \\\"Energy transfer is represented as directed edges\\\"],\\n                \\\"rules\\\": [\\\"Energy can only flow from lower to higher trophic levels\\\", \\\"Some energy is lost at each transfer\\\"]\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"name\\\": \\\"Information propagation in neural networks\\\",\\n                \\\"axioms\\\": [\\\"Neurons are represented as nodes\\\", \\\"Synapses are represented as weighted edges\\\"],\\n                \\\"rules\\\": [\\\"Information flows from input to output nodes\\\", \\\"Node activation depends on the sum of weighted inputs\\\"]\\n            },\\n            {\\n                \\\"name\\\": \\\"Market supply and demand\\\",\\n                \\\"axioms\\\": [\\\"Buyers and sellers are represented as nodes\\\", \\\"Transactions are represented as edges\\\"],\\n                \\\"rules\\\": [\\\"Price increases as demand exceeds supply\\\", \\\"Price decreases as supply exceeds demand\\\"]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n        return {str(i+1): phenomenon for i, phenomenon in enumerate(random.sample(phenomena, 2))}\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design a novel formal system based on the given axioms and rules, use it to model the phenomenon of {t['name']}, and solve a problem within that system.

Problem Formulation and Solution:\na) Problem: Given an ecosystem with three trophic levels and specific energy values and loss rates, determine the energy content at the highest trophic level.\n- Let \\( N_1 \\) be producers with \\( F(N_1) = 1000 \\) units.\n- \\( N_2 \\) be primary consumers with \\( F(N_2) = 0 \\) initially.\n- \\( N_3 \\) be secondary consumers with \\( F(N_3) = 0 \\) initially.\n- Energy transfer from \\( N_1 \\) to \\( N_2 \\) is \\( T(N_1, N_2) = 10\\% \\) of \\( F(N_1) \\) with \\( L(N_1, N_2) = 90\\% \\).\n- Energy transfer from \\( N_2 \\) to \\( N_3 \\) is \\( T(N_2, N_3) = 10\\% \\) of \\( F(N_2) \\) with \\( L(N_2, N_3) = 90\\% \\).\n\nb) Solution:\n- Energy transferred to \\( N_2 \\): \\( T(N_1, N_2) = 0.1 \\times 1000 = 100 \\) units.\n- Energy lost during transfer: \\( L(N_1, N_2) = 0.9 \\times 1000 = 900 \\) units.\n- \\( F(N_2) \\) after transfer: \\( F(N_2) = 100 \\) units.\n\n- Energy transferred to \\( N_3 \\): \\( T(N_2, N_3) = 0.1 \\times 100 = 10 \\) units.\n- Energy lost during transfer: \\( L(N_2, N_3) = 0.9 \\times 100 = 90 \\) units.\n- \\( F(N_3) \\) after transfer: \\( F(N_3) = 10 \\) units.\n\nc) Interpretation: In this ecosystem, only 10 units of energy are available at the highest trophic level (secondary consumers), reflecting the significant energy loss at each trophic level.\n\n4. System Analysis:\na) Strengths: The system effectively models the hierarchical structure of ecosystems and energy loss during trophic transfers, providing a clear representation of energy flow dynamics. It captures the constraints and inefficiencies inherent in real-world ecosystems.\n   Limitations: The model assumes fixed energy transfer rates and losses, which may not account for variations in real ecosystems. It also simplifies complex interactions into linear transfers, ignoring potential non-linearities and feedback loops.\nb) Comparison: Existing models like the Lotka-Volterra equations and energy pyramid models also capture energy flow but use differential equations and empirical data. Our formal system provides a more abstract and symbolic approach, simplifying the representation while retaining core principles.\nc) Extension: To address the limitation of fixed rates, introduce variable transfer and loss functions dependent on environmental factors and organism behaviors, enhancing the system's adaptability and realism.\n\n5. Interdisciplinary Connections:\na) Fields: \n   - Computer Science (Resource Allocation): The system can model resource distribution in networks, representing nodes as servers and edges as data flows, adapting energy functions to bandwidth or computational resources.\n   - Economics (Supply Chain): Nodes represent firms, and edges represent goods or capital flow, modeling inefficiencies and losses during transactions.\nb) Adaptations:\n   - For computer science, redefine \\( F(N) \\) as server capacity and \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\) as data transfer rate, with losses representing latency or packet loss.\n   - For economics, \\( F(N) \\) represents capital/assets, \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\) as transaction values, and \\( L(N_i, N_j) \\) as transaction costs or inefficiencies, providing insights into supply chain dynamics and optimizations."

System Analysis:\na) Strengths and limitations:\n- Strengths: The system effectively models the formation and strength of connections based on shared attributes, and it allows for dynamic changes in the network.\n- Limitations: The system may oversimplify real-world interactions by focusing solely on shared attributes and not considering other factors like geography, frequency of interaction, or external influences.\n\nb) Comparison: Traditional models like social graphs or network theory focus on static connections and may not account for attribute-based dynamics. Our system offers a more dynamic approach, reflecting changes in individual attributes and network structure over time.\n\nc) Extension: To address limitations, we can introduce additional rules for external influences (e.g., events, trends) and incorporate geographic constraints or interaction frequency.

By Rule 1, if two nodes share at least one common neighbor, a new edge can form. The sequence \\((u, n_1, n_2, ..., n_k, v)\\) implies that \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are connected through a path of intermediate nodes.

Initial energy at \\( N_1 \\): \\( E(N_1) = 10,000 \\) units.\n3. Energy transfer \\( T(N_1, N_2) \\): \\( E(N_2) = E(N_1) \\times (1 - \\epsilon) = 10,000 \\times 0.9 = 9,000 \\) units.\n4. Energy transfer \\( T(N_2, N_3) \\): \\( E(N_3) = E(N_2) \\times (1 - \\epsilon) = 9,000 \\times 0.9 = 8,100 \\) units.\n5. Energy transfer \\( T(N_3, N_4) \\): \\( E(N_4) = E(N_3) \\times (1 - \\epsilon) = 8,100 \\times 0.9 = 7,290 \\) units.\n6. Energy available at \\( N_4 \\): \\( E(N_4) = 7,290 \\) units.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nIn the real world, this calculation shows that due to energy loss at each trophic level, the energy available to tertiary consumers is significantly less than that available to primary producers, explaining why ecosystems support fewer higher-level consumers.\n\n4. System Analysis:\n**Strengths:**\n- The system effectively models the hierarchical structure of trophic levels and energy dissipation.\n- It provides a quantitative framework for analyzing energy flow in ecosystems.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The model assumes a fixed percentage of energy loss, which may not be accurate in all real-world scenarios where energy loss can vary.\n- It does not account for other factors like energy input from external sources or energy recycling within the ecosystem.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Compared to existing models like energy pyramids, this formal system offers a more precise mathematical approach.\n- Traditional models often provide qualitative insights, while this system allows for exact calculations.\n\n**Extension:**\nTo address variable energy loss, we could introduce a function \\( \\epsilon(N_i, N_j) \\) that allows for different energy loss values for different transfers, making the model more flexible and realistic.\n\n5. Interdisciplinary Connections:\n**Field 1: Economics**\n- The formal system could model financial resource flow within an economy, where nodes represent entities like businesses or households, and directed edges represent monetary transactions with associated losses (e.g., taxes, transaction fees).\n\n**Field 2: Computer Networks**\n- The system could be adapted to model data flow in computer networks, where nodes represent devices and edges represent data transfer channels with packet loss or delays.\n\n**Adaptations:**\n- For economics, the energy values would be replaced by monetary values, and the loss percentage could vary based on transaction type.\n- For computer networks, the energy values would be replaced by data packet sizes, and the loss would account for network reliability and efficiency.\n\nAnswer:",
            "1. Formal System Design:\na) Our formal system will use the given axioms and rules as a foundation and introduce new symbols and rules to capture the energy flow in ecosystems effectively. We define:\n- Nodes (N) represent organisms.\n- Directed edges (E) represent energy transfer.\n- Trophic levels (T) are represented as numeric values associated with nodes.\n- Energy (E) is quantified using a function \\( F(N) \\) that denotes the energy content of node N.\n\nb) Additional axioms:\n- Axiom 3: Energy transfer between nodes is represented by the function \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\) where \\( N_i \\) and \\( N_j \\) are nodes and \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\leq F(N_i) \\).\n- Axiom 4: Energy loss is represented by a function \\( L(N_i, N_j) \\) where \\( L(N_i, N_j) \\) is the energy lost during transfer from \\( N_i \\) to \\( N_j \\).\n\nc) Symbols, operators, and functions:\n- \\( N \\): Nodes (organisms).\n- \\( E(N_i, N_j) \\): Directed edge from \\( N_i \\) to \\( N_j \\) indicating energy transfer.\n- \\( T(N) \\): Trophic level of node \\( N \\).\n- \\( F(N) \\): Energy content of node \\( N \\).\n- \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\): Energy transferred from \\( N_i \\) to \\( N_j \\).\n- \\( L(N_i, N_j) \\): Energy lost during the transfer from \\( N_i \\) to \\( N_j \\).\n\nd) This system models the flow of energy by ensuring energy moves from producers to consumers, up the trophic levels, and accounts for energy loss at each transfer, mirroring real-world ecosystem dynamics.\n\n2. Theorem Proposal:\na) Theorem: \"In any ecosystem modeled by this formal system, the total energy at the highest trophic level is less than the total energy at the lowest trophic level.\"\nb) Proof: By Axiom 1 and 2, energy flows from lower to higher trophic levels with loss at each transfer (Axiom 4). Therefore, the energy at each successive trophic level is reduced by the energy lost, implying that the total energy at the highest trophic level must be less than that at the lowest.\nc) Significance: This theorem underscores the inefficiency of energy transfer in ecosystems, highlighting why apex predators are fewer in number compared to primary producers.\n\n3. Problem Formulation and Solution:\na) Problem: Given an ecosystem with three trophic levels and specific energy values and loss rates, determine the energy content at the highest trophic level.\n- Let \\( N_1 \\) be producers with \\( F(N_1) = 1000 \\) units.\n- \\( N_2 \\) be primary consumers with \\( F(N_2) = 0 \\) initially.\n- \\( N_3 \\) be secondary consumers with \\( F(N_3) = 0 \\) initially.\n- Energy transfer from \\( N_1 \\) to \\( N_2 \\) is \\( T(N_1, N_2) = 10\\% \\) of \\( F(N_1) \\) with \\( L(N_1, N_2) = 90\\% \\).\n- Energy transfer from \\( N_2 \\) to \\( N_3 \\) is \\( T(N_2, N_3) = 10\\% \\) of \\( F(N_2) \\) with \\( L(N_2, N_3) = 90\\% \\).\n\nb) Solution:\n- Energy transferred to \\( N_2 \\): \\( T(N_1, N_2) = 0.1 \\times 1000 = 100 \\) units.\n- Energy lost during transfer: \\( L(N_1, N_2) = 0.9 \\times 1000 = 900 \\) units.\n- \\( F(N_2) \\) after transfer: \\( F(N_2) = 100 \\) units.\n\n- Energy transferred to \\( N_3 \\): \\( T(N_2, N_3) = 0.1 \\times 100 = 10 \\) units.\n- Energy lost during transfer: \\( L(N_2, N_3) = 0.9 \\times 100 = 90 \\) units.\n- \\( F(N_3) \\) after transfer: \\( F(N_3) = 10 \\) units.\n\nc) Interpretation: In this ecosystem, only 10 units of energy are available at the highest trophic level (secondary consumers), reflecting the significant energy loss at each trophic level.\n\n4. System Analysis:\na) Strengths: The system effectively models the hierarchical structure of ecosystems and energy loss during trophic transfers, providing a clear representation of energy flow dynamics. It captures the constraints and inefficiencies inherent in real-world ecosystems.\n   Limitations: The model assumes fixed energy transfer rates and losses, which may not account for variations in real ecosystems. It also simplifies complex interactions into linear transfers, ignoring potential non-linearities and feedback loops.\nb) Comparison: Existing models like the Lotka-Volterra equations and energy pyramid models also capture energy flow but use differential equations and empirical data. Our formal system provides a more abstract and symbolic approach, simplifying the representation while retaining core principles.\nc) Extension: To address the limitation of fixed rates, introduce variable transfer and loss functions dependent on environmental factors and organism behaviors, enhancing the system's adaptability and realism.\n\n5. Interdisciplinary Connections:\na) Fields: \n   - Computer Science (Resource Allocation): The system can model resource distribution in networks, representing nodes as servers and edges as data flows, adapting energy functions to bandwidth or computational resources.\n   - Economics (Supply Chain): Nodes represent firms, and edges represent goods or capital flow, modeling inefficiencies and losses during transactions.\nb) Adaptations:\n   - For computer science, redefine \\( F(N) \\) as server capacity and \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\) as data transfer rate, with losses representing latency or packet loss.\n   - For economics, \\( F(N) \\) represents capital/assets, \\( T(N_i, N_j) \\) as transaction values, and \\( L(N_i, N_j) \\) as transaction costs or inefficiencies, providing insights into supply chain dynamics and optimizations."

            "content": "Given the complexity of the task family \"formal_system_design_and_application,\" here are several considerations:\n\n1. **Complexity and Depth**: The task requires the LLM to design a novel formal system, extend it with additional axioms and rules, propose and prove a theorem, solve a complex problem, and analyze the system. This involves deep abstract reasoning, logical consistency, and interdisciplinary knowledge, which are advanced capabilities.\n\n2. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task demands knowledge from multiple fields, such as ecology (for ecosystem energy flow), formal systems, and logical reasoning. This is challenging even for human experts.\n\n3. **Creativity and Logical Consistency**: The task requires the LLM to be creative in designing the system while maintaining logical consistency and relevance to real-world phenomena.\n\n4. **Evaluation Criteria**: The criteria for evaluation are stringent, requiring detailed and coherent responses across various sub-tasks, which adds to the task's difficulty.\n\nConsidering these points, a human evaluator would likely find it notable if an LLM succeeded at this task because it demonstrates a high level of abstract reasoning, creativity, and interdisciplinary knowledge.
