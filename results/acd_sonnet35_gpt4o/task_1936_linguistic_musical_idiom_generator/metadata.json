            "### 1. System Architecture\n\n#### 1.a) Key Components\nThe AI system designed to generate and analyze cross-cultural musical idioms based on linguistic features consists of the following key components:\n1. **Linguistic Analyzer**: This component processes Mandarin Chinese input to extract tonal patterns and syllable structures.\n2. **Tonal-Rhythmic Mapper**: Converts tonal patterns of Mandarin into rhythmic patterns based on Spanish musical traditions.\n3. **Rhythm Generator**: Generates the rhythmic sequences in the style of Spanish music.\n4. **Music Composer**: Integrates the rhythmic sequences into a coherent musical piece following Spanish musical idioms.\n5. **Evaluation Module**: Analyzes the generated music for cultural authenticity and aesthetic quality.\n\nThese components interact through a series of data transformations, from linguistic analysis to musical generation and evaluation.\n\n#### 1.b) Analyzing Tonal Patterns\nThe Linguistic Analyzer utilizes a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and acoustic analysis tools to identify the four primary tones in Mandarin Chinese: high-level, rising, falling-rising, and falling. It captures the pitch contour and duration of each syllable to accurately represent the tonal pattern.\n\n#### 1.c) Mapping to Spanish Rhythm\nThe Tonal-Rhythmic Mapper translates these tonal patterns into the rhythmic structures of Spanish music. For instance, the high-level tone could correspond to a steady, even rhythm, while the rising tone could map to an accelerating rhythm. The Mapper uses predefined rules and machine learning to associate these patterns with rhythmic elements such as the 12-beat comp\u00e1s of flamenco.\n\n#### 1.d) High-Level Diagram\n```plaintext\n+--------------------+    +-------------------+    +-----------------+\n| Linguistic Analyzer| -> | Tonal-Rhythmic    | -> | Rhythm Generator|\n+--------------------+    | Mapper            |    +-----------------+\n                          +-------------------+           |\n                                   |                      |\n                            +-------------------+         |\n                            | Music Composer    | <-------+\n                            +-------------------+\n                                   |\n                            +-------------------+\n                            | Evaluation Module |\n                            +-------------------+\n```\n\n### 2. Linguistic-Musical Mapping\n\n#### 2.a) Translating Tonal Patterns\nTo translate Mandarin tonal patterns into Spanish rhythm, the system uses the following mappings:\n- **High-Level Tone (Tone 1)**: Mapped to a steady, even rhythm, similar to the stable beats in a tango.\n- **Rising Tone (Tone 2)**: Mapped to an accelerating rhythm, reflecting the increasing pitch.\n- **Falling-Rising Tone (Tone 3)**: Mapped to a syncopated rhythm, capturing the fluctuation in pitch.\n- **Falling Tone (Tone 4)**: Mapped to a decelerating rhythm, reflecting the descending pitch.\n\nEach syllable's duration and pitch contour influence the rhythmic pattern's timing and intensity.\n\n#### 2.b) Accounting for Cultural Context\nThe system respects the cultural context by adhering to traditional Spanish musical forms such as flamenco's comp\u00e1s or the rhythmic patterns of traditional Spanish folk music. The Composer integrates these rhythms within the structure of these musical forms, ensuring cultural authenticity.\n\n#### 2.c) Example Translation\nConsider the Mandarin word \"\u5988\u5988\" (m\u0101ma, mother) with tones 1 and 1:\n- **Tonal Pattern**: High-level, High-level\n- **Rhythmic Representation**: Steady beat, Steady beat\n\nThis could be represented musically as two consecutive steady beats, fitting seamlessly into a rhythmic pattern typical of a Spanish folk dance.\n\n### 3. AI and Machine Learning Techniques\n\n#### 3.a) Techniques Used\nThe system employs a combination of neural networks, rule-based systems, and generative models. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the Linguistic Analyzer for pitch contour recognition, while a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network helps the Rhythm Generator predict suitable rhythmic sequences based on tonal inputs.\n\n#### 3.b) Learning and Adaptation\nThe system learns from a bilingual corpus of Mandarin speech and Spanish music. It uses supervised learning to map linguistic features to musical elements, and reinforcement learning to refine the musical output based on aesthetic evaluations.\n\n#### 3.c) Novel Algorithms\nA novel algorithm employed is the \"Tonal-Rhythmic Alignment Network\" (TRAN), which dynamically aligns tonal sequences with rhythmic patterns using an attention mechanism to ensure accurate mapping.\n\n#### 3.d) Pseudocode for Key Algorithm\n```python\nclass TRAN:\n    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):\n        self.encoder = LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim)\n        self.decoder = LSTM(hidden_dim, output_dim)\n        self.attention = Attention(hidden_dim)\n\n    def forward(self, tonal_sequence):\n        encoded_seq = self.encoder(tonal_sequence)\n        context_vector, attention_weights = self.attention(encoded_seq)\n        rhythmic_pattern = self.decoder(context_vector)\n        return rhythmic_pattern\n```\n\n### 4.

            "# 1. System Architecture\n\n## a) Key Components and Interactions\n\nThe AI system comprises five main components: the Linguistic Analyzer, the Tonal Mapper, the Musical Translator, the Cultural Contextualizer, and the Evaluation Module. These components interact to analyze Mandarin tones and generate Spanish musical idioms:\n\n- **Linguistic Analyzer**: Extracts tonal patterns from Mandarin Chinese using speech recognition and tonal analysis algorithms.\n- **Tonal Mapper**: Maps Mandarin tonal patterns to rhythmic patterns based on predefined rules and machine learning models.\n- **Musical Translator**: Converts rhythmic patterns into Spanish musical idioms, focusing on rhythm and integrating melodic elements.\n- **Cultural Contextualizer**: Ensures the generated music adheres to Spanish musical traditions and cultural nuances.\n- **Evaluation Module**: Assesses the quality and authenticity of the generated music using predefined metrics and human feedback.\n\n## b) Analyzing Tonal Patterns of Mandarin Chinese\n\nThe Linguistic Analyzer uses a combination of speech recognition, pitch tracking, and tonal classification algorithms to analyze Mandarin speech. The system identifies the four basic tones of Mandarin (high-level, rising, falling-rising, and falling) and extracts their pitch contours and durations.\n\n## c) Mapping Linguistic Features to Rhythm\n\nThe Tonal Mapper translates Mandarin tonal patterns into rhythmic patterns by associating each tone with specific rhythmic motifs common in Spanish music. For example, the high-level tone might be represented by a steady, even rhythm, while the falling tone could be mapped to a descending rhythmic pattern.\n\n## d) High-Level Diagram\n\n```plaintext\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n| Linguistic        | ---> | Tonal Mapper      | ---> | Musical           |\n| Analyzer          |      |                   |      | Translator        |\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n        |                       |                       |\n        v                       v                       v\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n| Speech Recognition|      | Rhythm Mapping    |      | Rhythm Generation |\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n        |                       |                       |\n        v                       v                       v\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n| Pitch Tracking    |      | Mapping Rules     |      | Melody Integration|\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n        |                       |                       |\n        v                       v                       v\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n| Tonal Classification |    | Machine Learning  |    | Cultural Contextualizer |\n+-------------------+      +-------------------+      +-------------------+\n```\n\n# 2. Linguistic-Musical Mapping\n\n## a) Translating Tonal Patterns\n\nThe system maps Mandarin tonal patterns to rhythmic motifs by analyzing the pitch and duration of each tone. The high-level tone (Tone 1) is mapped to a steady rhythm, the rising tone (Tone 2) to an ascending rhythm, the falling-rising tone (Tone 3) to a syncopated rhythm, and the falling tone (Tone 4) to a descending rhythm. This mapping is designed to reflect the tonal contour in the rhythmic structure of Spanish music.\n\n## b) Accounting for Musical Traditions\n\nThe Cultural Contextualizer ensures that the generated rhythms adhere to Spanish musical traditions, such as the 12-beat comp\u00e1s of flamenco. It adjusts the rhythmic patterns to fit within traditional Spanish forms, incorporating elements like palmas (hand clapping) and caj\u00f3n (box drum).\n\n## c) Specific Example\n\nConsider the Mandarin word \"m\u0101\" (mother) with a high-level tone. The system maps this to a steady rhythm, represented musically as a series of evenly spaced beats. In contrast, the word \"m\u01ce\" (horse) with a falling-rising tone is mapped to a syncopated rhythm, creating a more complex and dynamic rhythmic pattern.\n\n# 3. AI and Machine Learning Techniques\n\n## a) Techniques Used\n\nThe system employs a combination of neural networks for speech recognition and tonal analysis, rule-based systems for initial mapping, and generative models for music composition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used for pitch tracking, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units handle the rhythmic generation.\n\n## b) Learning and Adaptation\n\nThe system learns from a dataset of Mandarin speech and Spanish music, adapting to different linguistic and musical patterns through supervised learning. The neural networks are trained on annotated speech data to recognize tonal patterns and on musical scores to generate appropriate rhythms.\n\n## c) Novel Algorithms\n\nA novel aspect of the system is the use of a cross-modal generative adversarial network (GAN) to refine the musical output. The GAN consists of a generator that creates rhythmic patterns and a discriminator that evaluates their cultural authenticity, iteratively improving the quality of the generated music.\n\n## d) Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef generate_rhythm(mandarin_tone):\n    if mandarin_tone == 'high-level':\n        return steady_rhythm()\n    elif mandarin_tone == 'rising':\n        return ascending_rhythm()\n    elif mandarin_tone == 'falling-rising':\n        return syncopated_rhythm()\n    elif mandarin_tone == 'falling':\n        return descending_rhythm()\n\ndef steady_rhythm():\n    return [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\ndef ascending_rhythm():\n    return [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\ndef syncopated_rhythm():\n    return [1, 0.5, 1.5, 1]\n\ndef descending_rhythm():\n    return [4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\n# 4. Data Requirements and Preprocessing\n\n## a) Data Types and Sources\n\nThe system requires a dataset of Mandarin speech recordings annotated with tonal information and a collection of Spanish musical scores, particularly those emphasizing rhythm, such as flamenco and other folk traditions.\n\n## b) Data Preprocessing\n\nData preprocessing involves normalizing audio recordings, extracting pitch contours, and segmenting speech into syllables. For musical data, the system extracts rhythmic patterns and maps them to a common representation.\n\n## c) Challenges\n\nChallenges include the scarcity of annotated Mandarin speech data with tonal information and the difficulty of aligning linguistic features with musical rhythms. Creating a balanced dataset that accurately represents both languages and musical traditions is also a concern.\n\n## d) Synthetic Training Data\n\nTo generate synthetic training data, the system uses a data augmentation approach, creating variations of existing speech recordings by altering pitch and duration. For musical data, it generates new rhythmic patterns by combining elements from different Spanish musical styles.\n\n# 5. Output Analysis and Evaluation\n\n## a) Evaluation Method\n\nThe Evaluation Module uses a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments to evaluate the musical output. Quantitative metrics include rhythm complexity, adherence to musical form, and tonal accuracy. Qualitative assessments involve expert reviews and listener feedback.\n\n## b) Assessing Cultural Authenticity\n\nCultural authenticity is assessed by comparing the generated music to traditional Spanish musical forms. Experts in Spanish music evaluate the rhythm, instrumentation, and overall style to ensure cultural fidelity.\n\n## c) Potential Metrics\n\nMetrics for measuring success include:\n\n- **Rhythmic Accuracy**: Alignment of generated rhythms with Mandarin tonal patterns.\n- **Cultural Fidelity**: Adherence to Spanish musical traditions.\n- **Aesthetic Quality**: Subjective evaluation of musical appeal.\n\n## d) Scoring Example\n\nA generated piece is scored based on rhythmic accuracy (40%), cultural fidelity (40%), and aesthetic quality (20%). For instance, a piece with accurate rhythm and cultural elements but lacking in aesthetic appeal might score 80/100.\n\n# 6. Potential Applications and Ethical Considerations\n\n## a) Potential Applications\n\n1. **Music Composition**: The system assists composers in integrating linguistic elements into music, creating cross-cultural compositions.\n2. **Language Learning**: By translating linguistic features into music, the system aids language learners in understanding tonal patterns through auditory reinforcement.\n\n## b) Ethical Considerations\n\nEthical considerations include respecting cultural heritage and avoiding cultural appropriation. The system must generate music that honors the traditions it draws from, without misrepresentation.\n\n## c) Guidelines for Responsible Use\n\nGuidelines include:\n\n- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate the system's purpose and limitations.\n- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Involve cultural experts in the development and evaluation process.\n- **Ethical Use**: Ensure the music generated is used in ways that respect and celebrate cultural heritage.\n\n## d) Mitigating Biases\n\nTo mitigate biases, the system incorporates diverse training data and involves cultural experts in the evaluation process. Regular audits and updates ensure the system remains culturally sensitive and accurate.\n\nBy combining advanced AI techniques with a deep understanding of linguistic and musical traditions, this system bridges the gap between Mandarin tonal patterns and Spanish musical rhythms, fostering cross-cultural understanding and innovation in music composition.",

Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific and cultural plausibility.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section, numbered as above. Your total response should be between 1450-1750 words.\n\nExample: To illustrate the complexity of the task, consider how the tonal patterns in Mandarin Chinese (where pitch changes can alter word meaning) might be mapped to rhythmic patterns in Spanish flamenco music. Your system would need to account for the four tones in Mandarin and find creative ways to represent them using the complex rhythmic structures of flamenco, such as the 12-beat comp\u00e1s.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response includes a detailed design of an original AI system that generates and analyzes cross-cultural musical idioms based on {t['linguistic_feature']} of {t['source_language']} and {t['musical_element']} of {t['target_language']}.\",\n            \"The system architecture is clearly described with key components and their interactions explained, including a high-level diagram or pseudocode.\",\n            f\"The linguistic-musical mapping process is thoroughly explained with a specific example of how {t['linguistic_feature']} in {t['source_language']} would be represented musically in {t['target_language']}.\",\n            \"AI and machine learning techniques are described in detail, including learning and adaptation mechanisms, with a brief pseudocode or mathematical representation of a key algorithm.\",\n            \"Data requirements and preprocessing steps are specified, along with potential challenges and a method for generating synthetic training data.\",\n            \"A comprehensive method for evaluating the musical output and assessing cultural authenticity is proposed, including specific evaluation criteria and an example of how a generated musical piece would be scored.\",\n            \"Potential applications and ethical considerations are discussed with proposed guidelines for responsible use and strategies for mitigating biases.\",\n            \"The response adheres to the specified word count limits for each section and the overall word count range of 1450-1750 words.\",\n            \"The proposed system demonstrates creativity and originality, not simply describing existing approaches.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the nature of the task family \"linguistic_musical_idiom_generator,\" there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Complexity and Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task requires integrating deep knowledge of linguistics, music theory, and AI system design. This is inherently very challenging due to the need for interdisciplinary expertise, which is uncommon even among advanced LLMs.\n\n2. **Creativity and Originality**: The task calls for creative problem-solving and innovative approaches, which are not straightforward for LLMs as they typically rely on existing knowledge and patterns seen in their training data.\n\n3. **Technical Detail and Specificity**: The requirement to detail system architecture, linguistic-musical mapping, AI/ML techniques, data preprocessing, output evaluation, and ethical considerations demands a high level of specificity and technical depth. This is often a stumbling block for LLMs, which may struggle to generate coherent and technically sound responses across multiple detailed sections.\n\n4. **Evaluation via LLM Judge**: The scoring method employs another LLM to evaluate the response based on a set of detailed criteria. While LLM judges can be effective, they may not fully grasp the nuances of interdisciplinary tasks, especially those involving creative and novel solutions.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent in this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy. It demonstrates an unexpected level of capability in handling highly complex, interdisciplinary tasks that require both deep technical knowledge and creative thinking.\n\nDecision: Yes"
