            "**1. System Architecture**\n\n**a) Key Components of the AI System:**  \nThe core of our system is a neural network that mimics the structure of the human brain's language areas, particularly those involved in language acquisition and processing. It includes the following components:\n- **Input Layer:** Receives auditory and visual language inputs.\n- **Processing Layer:** Consists of interconnected neurons that simulate the brain's language-processing regions.\n- **Memory Layer:** Stores learned language patterns and rules, allowing for recall and application.\n- **Adaptation Layer:** Adjusts synaptic weights to simulate long-term potentiation (LTP).\n- **Output Layer:** Produces language outputs, such as text or speech.\n\n**b) Incorporating Neuroplasticity Principles:**  \nThe system incorporates principles of neuroplasticity by dynamically adjusting synaptic connections based on language input. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is simulated through a Hebbian learning mechanism, where the strength of synaptic connections is increased when neurons are activated simultaneously. This mechanism enables the system to strengthen connections that are frequently used, mirroring the way the human brain adapts and learns new information.\n\n**c) Modeling Austronesian Language Features:**  \nThe system includes specialized modules to handle the unique features of Austronesian languages, particularly ergative-absolutive alignment. These modules are designed to identify and process the syntactic and morphological patterns characteristic of ergative-absolutive languages, such as marking subjects of intransitive verbs similarly to objects of transitive verbs. The system uses a combination of rule-based and statistical methods to accurately model these linguistic features.\n\n**d) Real-time Learning and Adaptation:**  \nOur system employs continuous learning algorithms that allow for real-time adaptation to new language inputs. By continuously updating synaptic weights based on new data, the system can quickly adjust to changes in language use, such as new vocabulary or grammatical structures.
