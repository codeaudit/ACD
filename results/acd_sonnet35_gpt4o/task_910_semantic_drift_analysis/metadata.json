Connotations include notions of computational power, algorithmic sophistication, and data-driven learning.\n\n#### b) Comparison to Human Understanding\nIn human languages, 'Intelligence' encompasses cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, understanding complex ideas, and learning from experience. It also carries connotations of wisdom, emotional understanding, and creativity. The human concept of intelligence is broader and more nuanced, integrating emotional, social, and practical dimensions.\n\n### 2. Predicted Semantic Drift in AI\n\n#### a) Expected Changes\nOver the next 100 years, the meaning of 'Intelligence' in large language models is likely to evolve significantly. As AI systems become more integrated into everyday life and their capabilities expand, 'Intelligence' may come to signify a blend of cognitive and emotional competencies, mirroring the human understanding more closely. It could also encompass ethical reasoning and autonomous decision-making.\n\n#### b) Contributing Factors\nTechnological advancements such as the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and cognitive enhancement technologies will drive this drift. Societal changes, including increased reliance on AI in decision-making and personal interactions, will also influence the evolution of the term. Public perception and interdisciplinary research merging AI with fields like psychology and neuroscience will further shape this semantic shift.\n\n#### c) Examples of Evolution\nInitially, 'Intelligence' may start to include emotional intelligence as AI systems become capable of recognizing and responding to human emotions. Later, as AI systems potentially develop self-awareness and ethical reasoning, 'Intelligence' might signify the ability to make morally informed decisions autonomously. The term could also come to imply a partnership between human and machine intelligence, reflecting a synergistic relationship rather than a purely mechanistic one.\n\n### 3. Comparison to Human Language Evolution\n\n#### a) Historical Changes\nHistorically, the meanings of words in human languages have shifted due to cultural, technological, and social changes. For example, the word 'computer' once referred to a person who performed calculations but now signifies a digital device.

It also demands the ability to make predictions about future trends and compare them to historical linguistic changes, which is inherently speculative and requires nuanced reasoning.\n\n2. **Capability Requirements**: Successfully completing this task would require the LLM to not only understand current semantics but also predict future changes based on technological and societal trends. Additionally, the LLM must compare these predictions to historical linguistic changes and discuss implications for AI development, including ethical considerations.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated as very difficult for humans, indicating that it is challenging even for experts. Therefore, an LLM succeeding at this task would be particularly noteworthy.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The task is evaluated using an LLM judge based on specific criteria. If the LLM can meet these criteria, it demonstrates an advanced level of understanding and analytical capability.\n\nConsidering the above factors, if an LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would indeed be surprising and noteworthy because of the task's high complexity and the interdisciplinary knowledge required. The success indicates the LLM's advanced reasoning and predictive abilities, which are significant achievements in the field of AI.\n\nDecision: Yes"
