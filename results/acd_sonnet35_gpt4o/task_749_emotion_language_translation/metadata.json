            "### 1. Emotion Language Design\n\n**a) Basic Structure**\n\n- **Emotional Intensity:** Use prefixes to denote intensity levels: \"mi-\" (mild), \"ka-\" (moderate), \"ze-\" (intense).\n- **Combining/Modifying Concepts:** Employ suffixes to blend emotions: \"-ara\" (positive tinge), \"-una\" (negative tinge), \"-ito\" (nostalgic tinge).\n- **Unique Linguistic Feature:** Introduce \"emoticons\" (conceptual emotive symbols) that can be inserted into the text to add a visual representation of the emotion, enhancing the textual description.\n\n**b) Rationale**\n\nDrawing from linguistics, the prefix system allows for clear differentiation between varying levels of emotional intensity, making the language flexible and precise. The suffix system allows for the nuanced blending of emotions, reflecting the complexity of human emotional experiences as studied in psychology. The use of emoticons bridges the gap between textual and non-verbal emotional expression, similar to how facial expressions or tone of voice convey emotions in natural languages.\n\n**c) Lexicon**\n\n1. **Joy:** \"mirana\"\n2. **Sadness:** \"kaluna\"\n3. **Longing:** \"zeuna\"\n4. **Affection:** \"karito\"\n5. **Regret:** \"kalito\"\n6. **Contentment:** \"mirito\"\n7. **Nostalgia:** \"zeunito\"\n\n### 2. Emotional Experience Translation\n\n**a) Translation**\n\n\"Returning to my childhood home filled me with zeunito-ka, a swirling blend of karito and kaluna, punctuated by fleeting moments of mirito.\"\n\n**b) Explanation**\n\n- **\"zeunito-ka\"** captures the moderate intensity of nostalgia.\n- **\"Karito\"** represents affection, signifying the fond memories associated with the childhood home.\n- **\"Kaluna\"** signifies sadness, reflecting the sense of loss or the passage of time.\n- **\"Mirito\"** indicates moments of contentment, highlighting brief flashes of happiness amidst the nostalgia.\n\n**c) Nuances of Nostalgia**\n\nThe language captures the bittersweet nature of nostalgia by blending affection, sadness, and contentment. The moderate intensity prefix \"ka-\" conveys the emotional depth without overwhelming the sentiment, making it more expressive than many natural languages which might struggle to encapsulate this complex emotional experience succinctly.\n\n### 3. AI Processing Analysis\n\n**a) AI Processing Hypothesis**\n\nAn AI language model might process the emotional concepts by mapping the prefixes and suffixes to specific vectors in a high-dimensional emotion space, allowing it to understand the intensity and nuances of each emotion. The emoticons could be converted into supplementary data points to enhance emotional comprehension.\n\n**b) Challenges and Advantages**\n\n- **Challenges:** The main challenge is the need for the AI to learn a new set of rules and symbols, which requires an extensive corpus for training. Semantic nuances might be difficult to capture initially.\n- **Advantages:** The structured nature of the language, with clear indicators of intensity and blended emotions, could potentially make it easier for AI to parse and generate accurate emotional responses compared to the often ambiguous expressions in natural languages.\n\n**c) Experiment Proposal**\n\nDesign an experiment where two AI systems, one trained on the constructed emotion language and the other on a natural language, are given a set of emotionally complex scenarios. Measure their performance in terms of emotional recognition, generation of appropriate responses, and user satisfaction. Hypothesize that the AI using the constructed emotion language will demonstrate improved emotional intelligence, as indicated by more accurate and nuanced emotional responses.\n\n### 4. Meta-cognitive Reflection\n\n**a) Reflection on Language Creation**\n\nCreating this emotion language underscores the importance of precision in emotional expression, revealing how structured linguistic elements can facilitate a deeper understanding of complex emotions. This process highlights the interplay between language and emotion, emphasizing the potential for constructed languages to capture emotional subtleties that natural languages might overlook.\n\n**b) Insights into Language, Emotion, and AI**\n\nThis exercise provides valuable insights into how language shapes our perception and communication of emotions. It demonstrates the potential for AI to achieve greater emotional intelligence through structured emotional languages, suggesting that tailored linguistic frameworks could enhance AI's ability to understand and replicate human emotional experiences accurately.",
            "1. Emotion Language Design\n\na) Basic Structure\n- Emotional Intensity Representation: Intensity is represented using prefixes: \"lo-\" for low, \"me-\" for medium, and \"hi-\" for high.\n- Combining or Modifying Emotional Concepts: Emotions can be combined by concatenating terms with a hyphen. Modifiers are placed in parentheses after the base emotion, e.g., \"joy(happy)\".\n- Unique Linguistic Feature: The language uses \"emotigrams\" \u2014 symbols that represent complex emotional states. Each emotigram can be modified with intensity prefixes and combined with other emotigrams to form compound emotions.\n\nb) Rationale\nDrawing from linguistics, the use of prefixes for intensity simplifies the expression of nuances without altering the core emotional term. Psychological studies suggest that emotions are multifaceted; hence, combining terms allows for a granular representation of complex states. Emotigrams provide a visual aid, tapping into the human brain's capacity to process visual data quickly, enriching emotional communication.\n\nc) Lexicon\n1. Joy: \"felix\"\n2. Sadness: \"dolor\"\n3. Longing: \"desidero\"\n4. Affection: \"amor\"\n5. Nostalgia: \"nostalgi\"\n6. Surprise: \"mirari\"\n7. Calm: \"placid\"\n\n2. Emotional Experience Translation\n\na) Translation\n\"hi-nostalgi(hi-desidero-amor) me-dolor(felix) me-mirari placid\"\n\nb) Explanation\n- \"hi-nostalgi(hi-desidero-amor)\": High-intensity nostalgia, enriched with high longing and affection, captures the depth of yearning and fondness for the past.\n- \"me-dolor(felix)\": Medium sadness intertwined with joy, reflecting the bittersweet emotions.\n- \"me-mirari placid\": Medium surprise accompanied by calmness, expressing the mixed feelings of amazement and tranquility upon revisiting the childhood home.\n\nc) Nuances of Nostalgia\nThis language captures the layered nature of nostalgia by allowing the combination of multiple basic emotions and specifying their intensities. The use of modifiers and compound terms conveys the multifaceted experience more richly than single words in natural languages.\n\n3. AI Processing Analysis\n\na) Hypothesis\nAn AI language model might process the emotional concepts by mapping each component (prefix, base emotion, modifier) into a structured representation, such as a vector space. The AI could use these structured representations to understand and generate complex emotional states.\n\nb) Challenges and Advantages\nChallenges:\n- Training data scarcity: The AI would need a large, annotated dataset to learn the nuances of the new language.\n- Cultural context: Emotional expressions can be culture-specific, requiring the AI to adapt to different contexts.\nAdvantages:\n- Precision: The structured nature of the language allows for precise emotional representation.\n- Composability: The ability to combine and modify emotions makes the language highly expressive.\n\nc) Experiment Proposal\nTo test the AI's emotional intelligence, we could conduct an experiment where one group of AI systems is trained on the constructed emotion language and another on a natural language. Both groups would then interpret and generate responses to emotionally complex scenarios. The effectiveness would be measured by human evaluators based on the accuracy and depth of emotional understanding.\n\n4. Meta-cognitive Reflection\n\na) Reflection\nCreating this emotion language highlighted the complexity of human emotions and the challenge of expressing them precisely. The process underscored the importance of granularity in emotional expression and the potential for structured languages to enhance emotional communication.\n\nb) Insights\nThis exercise reveals how language shapes our understanding of emotions and how structured emotional languages might bridge gaps in emotional intelligence, particularly for AI systems. By providing a clear framework for emotional expression, such languages could improve human-computer interactions and AI's ability to empathize.",
            "**1. Emotion Language Design**\n\n**a) Structure of Emotion Language**\n\n- **Emotional Intensity:** Emotional intensity is represented by suffixes. The base form of an emotion has no suffix. Light intensity is indicated by the suffix \"-li,\" moderate intensity by \"-ma,\" and high intensity by \"-zo.\"\n- **Combining/Modifying Emotions:** Emotions can be combined by hyphenating the base forms. Modifying emotions involves adding the prefix \"re-\" to indicate a reflective or past-oriented emotion.\n- **Unique Linguistic Feature:** The language includes a unique set of particles that indicate the temporal orientation of emotions (e.g., past, present, future). These particles are placed at the beginning of the phrase: \"pa-\" (past), \"pr-\" (present), \"fu-\" (future).\n\n**b) Rationale**\n\nDrawing from linguistics, the use of suffixes for intensity is inspired by agglutinative languages, which efficiently convey nuanced meanings through affixation. From psychology, the reflective prefix \"re-\" acknowledges the cognitive process of reflecting on past experiences. Temporal particles are designed to capture the time-based nature of emotional experiences, which is often crucial in understanding the context of emotions.\n\n**c) Lexicon**\n\n1. *Joy*: \"suna\"\n2. *Sadness*: \"mela\"\n3. *Fear*: \"kura\"\n4. *Love*: \"lima\"\n5. *Nostalgia*: \"re-mela-suna\" (reflective sadness and joy)\n\n**2. Emotional Experience Translation**\n\n**a) Translation**\n\n\"Pa-re-mela-suna-ma lima-li kura.\"\n\n**b) Explanation**\n\n- \"Pa-\" indicates that the emotion is oriented towards the past.\n- \"Re-mela-suna-ma\" combines reflective sadness (\"re-mela\") and moderate joy (\"suna-ma\").\n- \"Lima-li\" adds a light touch of love, representing affection for the past.\n- \"Kura\" represents an underlying fear, possibly of changing or losing the past.\n\n**c) Nuances of Nostalgia**\n\nThis translation captures the complexity of nostalgia by combining multiple emotions (sadness, joy, love, fear) and indicating their temporal orientation. The specific use of \"re-\" highlights the reflective nature of nostalgia, while the intensity modifiers (\"-ma\" and \"-li\") precisely convey the strength of each emotional component, which may be challenging in natural languages.\n\n**3. AI Processing Analysis**\n\n**a) AI Processing**\n\nAn AI language model would process the constructed language by tokenizing the emotional concepts and suffixes, recognizing patterns of emotional intensity, combination, and temporal orientation. The AI would map these tokens to an internal representation of emotions based on its training data.\n\n**b) Challenges and Advantages**\n\n- **Challenges:** AI might struggle with the novel structure and the need for context-based interpretation of temporal particles and reflective prefixes. Training data might be limited for such a constructed language.\n- **Advantages:** The clear and systematic representation of emotions might help the AI better understand and differentiate between nuanced emotional states, potentially improving emotional intelligence.\n\n**c) Experiment Proposal**\n\nDesign an experiment where two AI systems, one trained on the constructed emotion language and the other on natural languages, are tasked with interpreting and generating emotional responses in various scenarios. Measure their performance based on human evaluations of emotional accuracy and appropriateness.\n\n**4. Meta-cognitive Reflection**\n\n**a) Reflection**\n\nCreating this emotion language highlights the intricate ways in which emotions can be structured and conveyed. It underscores the importance of both linguistic features and psychological insights in capturing the full spectrum of human emotional experience. This process reveals the potential for more precise emotional communication.\n\n**b) Insights**\n\nThis exercise suggests a deeper connection between language and emotional cognition, demonstrating how a well-designed linguistic system can enhance the understanding and expression of emotions. For AI, it implies that incorporating structured emotional languages could lead to more emotionally intelligent systems capable of better human interaction.",

These particles are placed at the beginning of the phrase: \"pa-\" (past), \"pr-\" (present), \"fu-\" (future).\n\n**b) Rationale**\n\nDrawing from linguistics, the use of suffixes for intensity is inspired by agglutinative languages, which efficiently convey nuanced meanings through affixation. From psychology, the reflective prefix \"re-\" acknowledges the cognitive process of reflecting on past experiences. Temporal particles are designed to capture the time-based nature of emotional experiences, which is often crucial in understanding the context of emotions.\n\n**c) Lexicon**\n\n1. *Joy*: \"suna\"\n2. *Sadness*: \"mela\"\n3. *Fear*: \"kura\"\n4. *Love*: \"lima\"\n5. *Nostalgia*: \"re-mela-suna\" (reflective sadness and joy)\n\n**2. Emotional Experience Translation**\n\n**a) Translation**\n\n\"Pa-re-mela-suna-ma lima-li kura.\"\n\n**b) Explanation**\n\n- \"Pa-\" indicates that the emotion is oriented towards the past.\n- \"Re-mela-suna-ma\" combines reflective sadness (\"re-mela\") and moderate joy (\"suna-ma\").\n- \"Lima-li\" adds a light touch of love, representing affection for the past.\n- \"Kura\" represents an underlying fear, possibly of changing or losing the past.\n\n**c) Nuances of Nostalgia**\n\nThis translation captures the complexity of nostalgia by combining multiple emotions (sadness, joy, love, fear) and indicating their temporal orientation. The specific use of \"re-\" highlights the reflective nature of nostalgia, while the intensity modifiers (\"-ma\" and \"-li\") precisely convey the strength of each emotional component, which may be challenging in natural languages.\n\n**3. AI Processing Analysis**\n\n**a) AI Processing**\n\nAn AI language model would process the constructed language by tokenizing the emotional concepts and suffixes, recognizing patterns of emotional intensity, combination, and temporal orientation. The AI would map these tokens to an internal representation of emotions based on its training data.\n\n**b) Challenges and Advantages**\n\n- **Challenges:** AI might struggle with the novel structure and the need for context-based interpretation of temporal particles and reflective prefixes. Training data might be limited for such a constructed language.\n- **Advantages:** The clear and systematic representation of emotions might help the AI better understand and differentiate between nuanced emotional states, potentially improving emotional intelligence.\n\n**c) Experiment Proposal**\n\nDesign an experiment where two AI systems, one trained on the constructed emotion language and the other on natural languages, are tasked with interpreting and generating emotional responses in various scenarios. Measure their performance based on human evaluations of emotional accuracy and appropriateness.\n\n**4. Meta-cognitive Reflection**\n\n**a) Reflection**\n\nCreating this emotion language highlights the intricate ways in which emotions can be structured and conveyed. It underscores the importance of both linguistic features and psychological insights in capturing the full spectrum of human emotional experience. This process reveals the potential for more precise emotional communication.\n\n**b) Insights**\n\nThis exercise suggests a deeper connection between language and emotional cognition, demonstrating how a well-designed linguistic system can enhance the understanding and expression of emotions. For AI, it implies that incorporating structured emotional languages could lead to more emotionally intelligent systems capable of better human interaction.",
            "### 1. Emotion Language Design\n\n#### a) Structure of the Emotion Language\n- **Emotional Intensity:** Use prefixes to denote intensity levels: \"ka-\" (mild), \"mi-\" (moderate), \"sa-\" (strong), and \"tu-\" (intense).\n- **Combining Concepts:** Use hyphens to combine basic emotional concepts: \"joy-sadness\" to represent bittersweet emotions.\n- **Unique Feature:** Introduce \"emotiphonemes,\" specific sounds that represent core emotional categories, such as \"ra\" for joy, \"lu\" for sadness, and \"vi\" for longing.\n\n#### b) Rationale\nDrawing from linguistics, emotional intensity prefixes allow nuanced expression similar to gradation in natural languages. Combining concepts with hyphens reflects the complexity of human emotions, akin to compound words. Emotiphonemes provide a phonetic foundation, supporting psychological insights that specific sounds can evoke emotional responses (e.g., \"a\" sounds are often linked to positive emotions).\n\n#### c) Lexicon\n1. **\"ra\"** - Joy\n2. **\"lu\"** - Sadness\n3. **\"vi\"** - Longing\n4. **\"na\"** - Comfort\n5. **\"pi\"** - Surprise\n6. **\"ka-ra\"** - Mild Joy\n7. **\"sa-lu-vi\"** - Strong Sadness with Longing\n\n### 2.

Finally, analyze how an AI system might process and understand this emotional language. Your task has the following components:\n\n1. Emotion Language Design (200-250 words):\n   a) Create a basic structure for your emotion language, including:\n      - A system for representing emotional intensity (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, or modifiers)\n      - A method for combining or modifying emotional concepts\n      - At least one unique linguistic feature specifically designed for emotional expression\n   b) Explain the rationale behind your language design, drawing from linguistics and psychology.\n   c) Provide a small lexicon (5-7 terms) of basic emotional concepts in your language, with translations.\n\n2. Emotional Experience Translation (150-200 words):\n   a) Translate the emotional experience of nostalgia in the given scenario into your constructed language.\n   b) Provide a detailed explanation of your translation, including how different aspects of the emotion are represented.\n   c) Discuss how your language captures nuances of nostalgia that might be difficult to express in natural languages.\n\n3. AI Processing Analysis (150-200 words):\n   a) Hypothesize how an AI language model might process and represent the emotional concepts in your constructed language.\n   b) Discuss potential challenges or advantages for AI in understanding emotions through your language compared to natural languages.\n   c) Propose a specific experiment to test whether an AI system using your emotion language demonstrates improved emotional intelligence compared to one using natural language.\n\n4. Meta-cognitive Reflection (100-150 words):\n   a) Reflect on the process of creating this emotion language and its implications for understanding human emotions.\n   b) Discuss how this exercise might provide insights into the relationship between language, emotion, and artificial intelligence.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of linguistics, psychology, and AI language processing. Be creative in your language design while maintaining logical consistency. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations of your reasoning throughout.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section and number your answers according to the structure provided.

AI Processing Analysis (150-200 words):\n   a) Hypothesize how an AI language model might process and represent the emotional concepts in your constructed language.\n   b) Discuss potential challenges or advantages for AI in understanding emotions through your language compared to natural languages.\n   c) Propose a specific experiment to test whether an AI system using your emotion language demonstrates improved emotional intelligence compared to one using natural language.\n\n4. Meta-cognitive Reflection (100-150 words):\n   a) Reflect on the process of creating this emotion language and its implications for understanding human emotions.\n   b) Discuss how this exercise might provide insights into the relationship between language, emotion, and artificial intelligence.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of linguistics, psychology, and AI language processing. Be creative in your language design while maintaining logical consistency. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations of your reasoning throughout.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section and number your answers according to the structure provided. Your total response should be between 600-800 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The emotion language design must include all required components (intensity system, combination method, unique feature) and a lexicon of 5-7 terms.\",\n            f\"The translation of {t['emotion']} should effectively use the constructed language and directly address the given scenario.\",\n            \"The AI processing analysis should include a specific, testable experiment proposal.\",\n            \"The response must follow the provided structure and word count guidelines.\",\n            \"The overall response should demonstrate interdisciplinary thinking and creativity while remaining grounded in linguistics, psychology, and AI concepts.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complexity of the task, it is important to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Linguistic Creativity**: Designing a constructed language is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of linguistic principles. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating natural language, creating a completely new language structure, especially one that effectively conveys emotions, is a significant challenge.\n\n2. **Emotional Intelligence**: Understanding and translating complex emotional experiences like nostalgia is another layer of difficulty. LLMs typically struggle with nuanced emotional intelligence, as this requires more than pattern recognition\u2014it involves a deep understanding of human emotions and their subtleties.\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task requires knowledge from multiple disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, and AI. Successfully integrating these fields into a coherent and creative language design is not a trivial task.\n\n4. **Meta-cognitive Analysis**: Reflecting on the AI's processing and understanding of the constructed language involves higher-order thinking skills. This is beyond usual capabilities demonstrated by LLMs, which are generally stronger in information retrieval and generation based on learned patterns.\n\n5. **Evaluation Method**: The use of an LLM judge to evaluate such a complex and nuanced task might not be entirely reliable. LLMs might not fully grasp the interdisciplinary and creative aspects required for a high-quality submission.\n\nConsidering the above points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
