            "1. Metaphor Analysis\na) The key components of the conceptual metaphor 'Life IS A Journey' include the source domain (Journey) and the target domain (Life). In this metaphor, life is understood as a journey, where there are paths, obstacles, destinations, companions, and progress.\nb) This metaphor shapes our understanding of career development by framing it as a path one follows, with milestones, goals, detours, and learning experiences along the way. It highlights the importance of progress and movement, suggesting that careers are dynamic and evolving.\nc) Three specific mappings:\n   - Paths and Routes (Journey) map to Career Paths and Progressions (Life).\n   - Obstacles (Journey) map to Challenges and Setbacks (Career Development).\n   - Destinations (Journey) map to Career Goals and Achievements (Career Development).\n\n2. Novel Metaphor Creation\na) New Metaphor: 'Career Development IS A Garden'\nb) The rationale behind this choice is that a garden encapsulates growth, nurturing, periodic harvesting, and cyclical change, which parallels the ongoing development and cultivation of one's career.\nc) Three mappings:\n   - Soil and Environment (Garden) map to Workplace and Industry Conditions (Career Development).\n   - Plant Growth (Garden) maps to Skill Development and Professional Growth (Career Development).\n   - Seasons and Cycles (Garden) map to Career Phases and Periods of Learning (Career Development).\nd) Insights: This metaphor suggests that careers require ongoing care and attention, can flourish under the right conditions, and may need different strategies in different phases (e.g., planting, growing, harvesting). It emphasizes patience, adaptability, and the importance of a supportive environment.\n\n3. Problem-Solving Application\na) Problem: Navigating a mid-career crisis, characterized by a lack of motivation, dissatisfaction, and uncertainty about future career direction.\nb) Applying 'Life IS A Journey': This metaphor suggests viewing the mid-career crisis as an obstacle or detour. It encourages individuals to reassess their path, consider alternative routes, and set new destinations or goals.\n   Applying 'Career Development IS A Garden': This metaphor suggests viewing the crisis as a phase in the growth cycle. It implies that this period could be a time for replanting, pruning, or rejuvenating one's career, perhaps by acquiring new skills or exploring different roles.\nc) Proposed Solution: Combining these metaphors, the approach to the mid-career crisis involves a two-step process. First, reassess and redefine career goals (Journey) by exploring new opportunities and setting fresh objectives. Second, nurture and rejuvenate professional skills and networks (Garden) by investing in professional development, seeking mentorship, and creating a supportive environment.\nd) Metaphorical reasoning highlights the importance of both setting new goals and nurturing one's skills and environment. The journey metaphor provides a sense of direction and purpose, while the garden metaphor emphasizes growth and sustainability.\n\n4. Metaphor Limitations and Ethical Considerations\na) Limitations: The 'Life IS A Journey' metaphor might oversimplify career development, ignoring the complexity and unpredictability of real-life careers. The 'Career Development IS A Garden' metaphor may romanticize the process, underestimating external factors like economic downturns or job market shifts.\nb) Ethical Considerations: These metaphors could lead to unrealistic expectations or pressure individuals to constantly progress or grow, potentially leading to burnout. They may also overlook systemic issues like discrimination or unequal opportunities.\nc) Mitigation: To address these concerns, it's important to complement metaphors with realistic assessments and acknowledge external factors. Encourage a balanced view that includes rest and reflection (Garden) and recognizes that detours and pauses are part of the journey.\n\n5. Cross-Domain Application\na) Application to Education: 'Education IS A Garden'\nb) This application emphasizes the nurturing and growth aspects of education. Just as plants need the right conditions to thrive, students require a supportive learning environment, personalized attention, and time to develop.\nc) Challenges: One challenge might be ensuring that this metaphor does not lead to passive learning, where students are seen as needing only external inputs. Addressing this requires emphasizing active, student-driven learning alongside nurturing.\nd) Insights: This application could lead to innovations in educational approaches, such as personalized learning plans, holistic development programs, and creating school environments that support mental and emotional well-being. It emphasizes the need for patience, adaptability, and recognizing individual growth patterns in students.",
            "1. Metaphor Analysis:\n\na) The key components of the given conceptual metaphor \"Life IS A Journey\" include the source domain (Journey) and the target domain (Life). In this metaphor, life is conceptualized as a journey, which involves movement from one place to another, encountering obstacles, making decisions at crossroads, and experiencing progress and setbacks.\n\nb) This metaphor shapes our understanding of the target domain (Career Development) by framing careers as pathways that individuals navigate over time. It suggests that career development involves progress, direction, and milestones, similar to how a journey involves traveling towards a destination, encountering challenges, and making choices at various points.\n\nc) Three specific mappings between elements of the source and target domains are:\n   - The starting point of a journey maps to the beginning of a career.\n   - Obstacles or detours on a journey map to challenges or setbacks in a career.\n   - Reaching a destination on a journey maps to achieving career goals or milestones.\n\n2. Novel Metaphor Creation:\n\na) New conceptual metaphor: \"Career Development IS Gardening\"\n\nb) The rationale behind this choice is that both gardening and career development involve nurturing growth, patience, and attention to the environment. Just as a gardener cultivates plants, a person cultivates their career through continuous effort and adaptation to changing conditions.\n\nc) Three mappings between elements of the new metaphor:\n   - Plant seeds in gardening map to the initial steps taken in a career, such as education and skill acquisition.\n   - Weeds in a garden map to distractions or negative influences in a career.\n   - Harvesting crops maps to achieving career success and reaping the benefits of hard work.\n\nd) Potential insights from this new metaphor include the importance of nurturing one\u2019s career continuously and recognizing that growth takes time and effort. It also highlights the need for adaptability and dealing with negative influences proactively.\n\n3. Problem-Solving Application:\n\na) Specific problem: A mid-career professional feels stuck in their current role and is uncertain about how to advance or change their career path.\n\nb) Applying \"Life IS A Journey\" metaphor:\n   - Analyze the problem by viewing the current role as a detour or a challenging part of the journey. \n   - Use the metaphor to encourage the professional to view this period as a temporary phase and to explore new paths or opportunities (crossroads).\n\n   Applying \"Career Development IS Gardening\" metaphor:\n   - Analyze the problem by viewing the current career role as a plant that needs more nutrients or a different environment.\n   - Use the metaphor to encourage the professional to seek new knowledge or skills (plant nutrients) and to consider changes in their work environment or industry (re-potting the plant).\n\nc) Proposed solution:\n   - Combining insights from both metaphors, the professional should first assess their current skills and identify areas for growth (gardening). They should also explore new opportunities within or outside their current organization (journey).\n   - They can approach this by setting short-term goals to acquire new skills and long-term goals to change roles or industries, viewing each step as part of their career journey.\n\nd) Metaphorical reasoning led to this solution by providing a structured way to view the career as a dynamic and evolving process, emphasizing both the journey's progression and the need for continuous nurturing and adaptation.\n\n4. Metaphor Limitations and Ethical Considerations:\n\na) Potential limitations:\n   - The \"Life IS A Journey\" metaphor may oversimplify career development by implying a linear path, which might not reflect the complex and non-linear nature of many careers.\n   - The \"Career Development IS Gardening\" metaphor might imply that individuals have full control over their career growth, ignoring external factors such as economic conditions or organizational politics.\n\nb) Ethical considerations:\n   - Using these metaphors could lead to unrealistic expectations about career progression or personal responsibility for career setbacks.\n\nc) Mitigation strategies:\n   - To address these limitations, it is important to emphasize the non-linear and multifaceted nature of career development.\n   - Acknowledge external influences and encourage a balanced view that combines personal effort with awareness of external factors.\n\n5. Cross-Domain Application:\n\na) Applying \"Career Development IS Gardening\" to the domain of Personal Relationships.\n\nb) In personal relationships, the gardening metaphor can highlight the importance of continuous effort, nurturing, and adapting to changing conditions. For example, planting seeds can map to initiating relationships, while weeding can map to addressing conflicts or negative behaviors.\n\nc) This cross-domain application might lead to new insights by encouraging individuals to view relationships as dynamic and requiring continuous care and attention. It can also promote patience and long-term commitment, as growth in relationships, like in gardens, takes time and effort.\n\nd) Challenges might include ensuring that individuals do not view relationships as purely transactional or controllable, as real relationships involve mutual effort and external influences. It is important to balance the metaphor with an understanding of the complexity and unpredictability of human interactions.",

These skills are considerably challenging for LLMs to exhibit at a high level, particularly in a coherent and insightful manner across multiple sections of the task.\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation criteria involve subjective judgments about the quality and insightfulness of the response, which can be particularly difficult for LLMs to handle accurately and consistently.
