1. Cognitive Architecture Design (200-250 words):
   a) Describe the key components of your cognitive architecture for {t['being']}.
   b) Explain how these components interact to process information and make decisions.
   c) Incorporate at least one unique feature inspired by {t['mythology']} mythology.

2. Mythological Basis (150-200 words):
   a) Explain how your cognitive architecture reflects {t['being']}'s characteristics and abilities in {t['mythology']} mythology.
   b) Discuss any conflicts or synergies between traditional mythology and your cognitive science-based approach.

3. Problem-Solving Application (250-300 words):
   a) Apply your cognitive architecture to the problem of {t['problem']}.
   b) Provide a step-by-step breakdown of how {t['being']} would approach and solve this problem using the designed cognitive architecture.
   c) Explain any unique insights or solutions that emerge from this approach.

4. Comparative Analysis (150-200 words):
   Compare your mythological cognitive architecture to a well-known artificial intelligence cognitive architecture (e.g., ACT-R, SOAR, or CLARION). Discuss similarities, differences, and potential advantages of each approach.

5. Ethical and Narrative Implications (100-150 words):
   a) Discuss the ethical implications of your cognitive architecture in the context of {t['mythology']} mythology.
   b) Explain how this cognitive architecture might influence storytelling and character development in modern adaptations of {t['mythology']} myths.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of cognitive science principles, mythology, and creative problem-solving. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining logical consistency and mythological authenticity."""
