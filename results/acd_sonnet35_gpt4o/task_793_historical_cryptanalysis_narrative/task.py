        return f"""You are a historian and cryptanalyst tasked with decrypting a historical message and constructing a plausible narrative based on the decrypted information. Follow these steps:

1. Decryption (100-150 words):
   a) The message "{t['encrypted']}" is encrypted using a {t['cipher_type']}.
   b) Explain the decryption process and provide the decrypted message.
   c) Briefly explain how you determined the correct decryption.

2. Historical Context Analysis (150-200 words):
   a) The message is from the {t['context']} era.
   b) Analyze the historical context of the decrypted message.
   c) Identify key historical figures, events, or conflicts that might be related to the message.

3. Narrative Construction (250-300 words):
   a) Construct a plausible historical narrative incorporating the decrypted message.
   b) Your narrative should include:
      - At least two historical figures (real or fictional)
      - A clear conflict or tension related to the message
      - A resolution or consequence stemming from the message
   c) Ensure your narrative is consistent with known historical facts of the era.

4. Cryptographic Impact Analysis (100-150 words):
   a) Discuss the potential impact of cryptography on historical events related to your narrative.
   b) Explain how the use of this cipher might have influenced communication and strategy during the era.

Ensure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of cryptography, historical analysis, and narrative construction. Be creative in your narrative while maintaining historical plausibility.

Your total response should be between 600-800 words."""
