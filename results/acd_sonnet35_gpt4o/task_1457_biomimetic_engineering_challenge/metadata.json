Use appropriate technical terminology and provide clear explanations for complex concepts.\n\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biological system and its relevance to the engineering problem.\",\n            \"The biomimetic solution is creative, well-designed, and effectively addresses the given problem and constraint.\",\n            \"The explanation of engineering principles is accurate and shows how they integrate with the biomimetic aspects.\",\n            \"The performance analysis is insightful and provides a meaningful comparison to existing technologies.\",\n            \"The discussion of sustainability, scalability, and future developments is thoughtful and relevant.\",\n            \"The overall response shows a high level of interdisciplinary knowledge integration and problem-solving skills.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family described and the complexity of the task, several factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task requires integration of knowledge from biology and engineering, which is a significant challenge for an LLM.\n2. **Creativity in Problem-Solving**: The task demands a novel and creative solution, which involves not just regurgitating existing knowledge but synthesizing new ideas.\n3. **Technical Detail and Plausibility**: The response must be technically detailed and scientifically plausible, which requires a deep understanding of both disciplines.\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring method relies on another LLM (eval_with_llm_judge) to evaluate the submission against detailed criteria.\n\nGiven these factors, and considering that even human experts might find this task very difficult, an LLM successfully completing this task is noteworthy. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n- LLMs are typically strong in generating coherent text based on provided data and instructions but may struggle with highly specialized and interdisciplinary tasks.\n- The required depth of understanding and creativity for a biomimetic engineering solution is higher than what is commonly expected from LLMs.\n- The success here indicates that the LLM was able to not only understand the biological and engineering concepts but also creatively apply them, which is a significant achievement.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
