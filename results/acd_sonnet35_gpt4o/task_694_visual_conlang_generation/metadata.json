The task should be difficult enough to push the boundaries of the model's abilities while still being well-defined and evaluable.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"visual_conlang_generation\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design a visual constructed language (conlang) based on given parameters, then use it to translate a short text and analyze its implications for visual communication and AI\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"visual-linguistic creativity, cross-modal translation, analytical reasoning, and interdisciplinary knowledge application\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"class TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"base_shape\\\": \\\"triangle\\\",\\n                \\\"color_system\\\": \\\"RGB\\\",\\n                \\\"grammatical_feature\\\": \\\"aspect\\\",\\n                \\\"text_to_translate\\\": \\\"The sun will rise tomorrow.\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"base_shape\\\": \\\"circle\\\",\\n                \\\"color_system\\\": \\\"CMYK\\\",\\n                \\\"grammatical_feature\\\": \\\"evidentiality\\\",\\n                \\\"text_to_translate\\\": \\\"I heard that it might rain later.\\\"\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design a visual constructed language (conlang) and use it to translate a given text.

            "### Visual Conlang Design\n\n#### a) Visual Language System Using Triangle and RGB Color System\nThe visual constructed language (conlang) uses triangles as its base shape, combined with the RGB color system to convey meaning. Each triangle's orientation, size, color, and additional embellishments (such as lines, dots, or internal subdivisions) represent different parts of speech and grammatical nuances. The primary colors (red, green, blue) and their combinations (cyan, magenta, yellow, and white) indicate broad categories, while variations in shade and saturation add further specificity.\n\n#### b) Representing Different Parts of Speech\n- **Nouns:** Equilateral triangles with solid colors. The color denotes the category (e.g., red for living beings, green for objects, blue for abstract concepts).\n- **Verbs:** Right-angled triangles with combinations of colors along the edges. The hypotenuse direction indicates tense (upward for future, downward for past, horizontal for present).\n- **Adjectives:** Isosceles triangles with a gradient of colors. The base color represents the adjective's intensity or degree.\n- **Adverbs:** Small triangles attached to the main verb triangle, using a dot pattern to convey the manner or degree.\n- **Prepositions:** Inverted triangles with a border color indicating the type of relationship (spatial, temporal, causal).\n\n#### c) Incorporating Aspect\nAspect is conveyed through internal subdivisions within the triangles:\n- **Simple aspect:** Single solid color.\n- **Progressive aspect:** Horizontal lines within the triangle.\n- **Perfect aspect:** Dots within the triangle.\n- **Perfect progressive aspect:** Combination of horizontal lines and dots.\n\n#### d) Examples of Basic Symbols\n1. **Sun (noun):**\n   - Shape: Equilateral triangle.\n   - Color: Yellow.\n   - Modifications: None.\n2. **Rise (verb):**\n   - Shape: Right-angled triangle.\n   - Color: Gradient from green to blue.\n   - Modifications: Hypotenuse pointing upward.\n3. **Tomorrow (adverb):**\n   - Shape: Small triangle attached to the verb.\n   - Color: Cyan.\n   - Modifications: Single dot pattern.\n4. **Bright (adjective):**\n   - Shape: Isosceles triangle.\n   - Color: Gradient from white to yellow.\n   - Modifications: None.\n5. **Will (tense marker):**\n   - Shape: Small triangle above the verb triangle.\n   - Color: Red border.\n   - Modifications: None.\n\n### Translation\n\n#### a) Translation of \"The sun will rise tomorrow.\"\n- **Sun:** Equilateral triangle, yellow.\n- **Will:** Small triangle above the verb, red border.\n- **Rise:** Right-angled triangle, gradient green to blue, hypotenuse upward.\n- **Tomorrow:** Small triangle attached to the verb, cyan with single dot.\n\n#### b) Description of Translation\n- The **sun** is depicted as a yellow equilateral triangle, indicating it is a noun and a celestial body.\n- **Will** is represented by a small triangle above the verb with a red border, indicating future tense.\n- **Rise** is shown as a right-angled triangle with a gradient from green to blue, pointing upwards, indicating an upward movement and verb.\n- **Tomorrow** is a small cyan triangle with a single dot pattern, attached to the verb, indicating an adverbial time reference.\n\n#### c) Challenges and Solutions\nOne challenge was differentiating between tense and aspect within the limited visual space of triangles. This was addressed by using additional smaller triangles and internal patterns to convey these grammatical features without overcrowding the symbols.\n\n### Visual Language Analysis\n\n#### a) Strengths and Limitations\n**Strengths:**\n- **Compact Representation:** The use of triangles and colors allows for compact and visually distinct symbols.\n- **Intuitive Aspect Representation:** Patterns within triangles intuitively convey grammatical aspects.\n- **Visual Appeal:** The colorful, geometric nature is aesthetically pleasing and engaging.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Color Perception:** Variations in color perception could lead to misunderstandings.\n- **Complexity:** The need for fine details (like dots and lines) may complicate quick comprehension.\n- **Limited Expressiveness:** Abstract and nuanced concepts might be harder to represent compared to written languages.\n\n#### b) Processing by the Human Brain\nThe human brain processes visual information in a different manner than textual or auditory data. Visual languages activate regions associated with spatial awareness and pattern recognition more heavily. This could lead to faster recognition but might require more cognitive load to interpret complex sentences.\n\n#### c) Representing Complex Abstract Concepts\nAbstract concepts can be represented by combining primary symbols with modifications. For instance, \"freedom\" could be a blue equilateral triangle (abstract concept) with an internal pattern of dots and lines indicating its multifaceted nature and dynamic state.\n\n### AI and Visual Language Processing\n\n#### a) Training an AI Model\nTo train an AI model:\n1. **Data Collection:** Create a large dataset of visual symbols and corresponding textual translations.\n2. **Image Recognition:** Use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and interpret the shapes and colors of the triangles.\n3. **Sequence Learning:** Implement recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers to understand the sequence and relationships between symbols.\n\n#### b) Potential Applications\n- **Human-AI Interaction:** Use in interfaces where visual cues and quick recognition are crucial, such as augmented reality (AR) systems.\n- **Data Visualization:** Enhance data visualization tools that require quick, intuitive understanding of complex data points.\n\n#### c) Improving Existing Systems\nPrinciples from this visual conlang can improve visual programming languages by introducing more intuitive symbols and color codes.

            "**1. Visual Conlang Design**\n\n**a) Visual Language System:**\nThe visual conlang is based on an equilateral triangle as the core shape, incorporating the RGB color system to distinguish different parts of speech. The triangle can be modified by adding lines, dots, or smaller triangles inside or around it, and by using varying colors to convey meaning.\n\n**b) Parts of Speech Representation:**\n- **Nouns:** Represented by a filled triangle with a solid border. The color of the triangle indicates the category of the noun (e.g., red for living beings, blue for natural objects, green for man-made objects).\n- **Verbs:** Represented by a triangle with a dashed border. The color indicates tense (e.g., red for present, blue for past, green for future).\n- **Adjectives:** Represented by a smaller triangle inside a larger triangle. The color indicates the type of adjective (e.g., red for quality, blue for quantity, green for size).\n- **Adverbs:** Represented by a triangle with a dot in the center. The color indicates the type of adverb (e.g., red for manner, blue for time, green for place).\n- **Prepositions:** Represented by interconnected triangles forming a chain. The color indicates the relation (e.g., red for spatial, blue for temporal, green for causal).\n\n**c) Grammatical Aspect:**\nAspect is shown by adding lines inside the triangle:\n- **Simple Aspect:** No additional lines.\n- **Continuous Aspect:** A horizontal line inside the triangle.\n- **Perfect Aspect:** A vertical line inside the triangle.\n- **Perfect Continuous Aspect:** Both horizontal and vertical lines inside the triangle.\n\n**d) Example Symbols:**\n1. **Sun (Noun):** A red filled triangle with a solid border.\n2. **Rise (Verb, Future, Simple Aspect):** A green triangle with a dashed border and no additional lines.\n3. **Bright (Adjective, Quality):** A red smaller triangle inside a larger triangle.\n4. **Tomorrow (Adverb, Time):** A blue triangle with a dot in the center.\n5. **Above (Preposition, Spatial):** Two red interconnected triangles forming a chain.\n\n**2.

This was addressed by using color and modifications to the triangle shape.\n\n**3. Visual Language Analysis**\n\n**a) Strengths and Limitations:**\n- **Strengths:** The use of colors and shapes makes the language easily distinguishable and memorable. It can be processed quickly, potentially making it faster for visual learners.\n- **Limitations:** Colorblind individuals may struggle. The system also requires familiarity with the color and shape conventions, which could be a steep learning curve compared to phonetic languages.\n\n**b) Brain Processing:**\nThe brain processes visual information in parallel, which might make this language faster to decode once learned. However, it could also require more cognitive resources initially due to the need to interpret colors and shapes simultaneously.\n\n**c) Representing Complex Concepts:**\nAbstract concepts can be represented by combining multiple triangles and colors. For example, \"freedom\" could be a series of interconnected triangles of various colors, symbolizing different aspects such as \"individuality\" (red triangle) and \"lack of constraints\" (green triangle).\n\n**4. AI and Visual Language Processing**\n\n**a) Training an AI Model:**\nTraining an AI model would involve creating a large dataset of visual symbols with corresponding meanings. Techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could be used to recognize the shapes and colors. The model would be trained using supervised learning with labeled examples.\n\n**b) Applications:**\nThis visual language could enhance human-AI interactions by allowing more intuitive commands and responses. It could also aid in data visualization by providing a consistent visual grammar for complex datasets, making patterns and relationships clearer.\n\n**c) Improving Visual Programming Languages:**\nPrinciples from this conlang could improve visual programming languages by standardizing how different elements are represented. For instance, different types of operations (e.g., loops, conditionals) could be represented by specific color-coded shapes.\n\n**5. Linguistic and Cognitive Implications**\n\n**a) Language Universals:**\nThis visual language challenges the notion that language must be linear and auditory. It supports theories that language can be multimodal and that humans can adapt to new forms of communication.\n\n**b) Cognitive Effects:**\nUsing a visual language may enhance visual-spatial reasoning and creativity. It could also reduce reliance on verbal skills, potentially benefiting individuals with language processing disorders.\n\n**c) Experiment Proposal:**\nAn experiment could involve participants learning the visual language and then performing spatial reasoning tasks. Comparing their performance to a control group using a traditional language could reveal the impact on cognitive abilities.\n\n**Visual Representations:**\n\n1. **Sun (Noun):** \n   - Shape: Filled equilateral triangle\n   - Color: Red\n   - Border: Solid\n\n2. **Rise (Verb, Future, Simple Aspect):**\n   - Shape: Equilateral triangle\n   - Color: Green\n   - Border: Dashed\n   - Lines: None\n\n3. **Bright (Adjective, Quality):**\n   - Shape: Smaller triangle inside a larger triangle\n   - Color: Red for both triangles\n\n4. **Tomorrow (Adverb, Time):**\n   - Shape: Equilateral triangle\n   - Color: Blue\n   - Dot: Center of the triangle\n\n5. **Above (Preposition, Spatial):**\n   - Shape: Two interconnected equilateral triangles\n   - Color: Red for both triangles",

            "### Visual Conlang Design\n\n#### a) Visual Language System Using Triangle and RGB Color System\nThe visual constructed language (conlang) uses triangles as its base shape, combined with the RGB color system to convey meaning. Each triangle's orientation, size, color, and additional embellishments (such as lines, dots, or internal subdivisions) represent different parts of speech and grammatical nuances. The primary colors (red, green, blue) and their combinations (cyan, magenta, yellow, and white) indicate broad categories, while variations in shade and saturation add further specificity.\n\n#### b) Representing Different Parts of Speech\n- **Nouns:** Equilateral triangles with solid colors. The color denotes the category (e.g., red for living beings, green for objects, blue for abstract concepts).\n- **Verbs:** Right-angled triangles with combinations of colors along the edges. The hypotenuse direction indicates tense (upward for future, downward for past, horizontal for present).\n- **Adjectives:** Isosceles triangles with a gradient of colors. The base color represents the adjective's intensity or degree.\n- **Adverbs:** Small triangles attached to the main verb triangle, using a dot pattern to convey the manner or degree.\n- **Prepositions:** Inverted triangles with a border color indicating the type of relationship (spatial, temporal, causal).\n\n#### c) Incorporating Aspect\nAspect is conveyed through internal subdivisions within the triangles:\n- **Simple aspect:** Single solid color.\n- **Progressive aspect:** Horizontal lines within the triangle.\n- **Perfect aspect:** Dots within the triangle.\n- **Perfect progressive aspect:** Combination of horizontal lines and dots.\n\n#### d) Examples of Basic Symbols\n1. **Sun (noun):**\n   - Shape: Equilateral triangle.\n   - Color: Yellow.\n   - Modifications: None.\n2. **Rise (verb):**\n   - Shape: Right-angled triangle.\n   - Color: Gradient from green to blue.\n   - Modifications: Hypotenuse pointing upward.\n3. **Tomorrow (adverb):**\n   - Shape: Small triangle attached to the verb.\n   - Color: Cyan.\n   - Modifications: Single dot pattern.\n4. **Bright (adjective):**\n   - Shape: Isosceles triangle.\n   - Color: Gradient from white to yellow.\n   - Modifications: None.\n5. **Will (tense marker):**\n   - Shape: Small triangle above the verb triangle.\n   - Color: Red border.\n   - Modifications: None.\n\n### Translation\n\n#### a) Translation of \"The sun will rise tomorrow.\"\n- **Sun:** Equilateral triangle, yellow.\n- **Will:** Small triangle above the verb, red border.\n- **Rise:** Right-angled triangle, gradient green to blue, hypotenuse upward.\n- **Tomorrow:** Small triangle attached to the verb, cyan with single dot.\n\n#### b) Description of Translation\n- The **sun** is depicted as a yellow equilateral triangle, indicating it is a noun and a celestial body.\n- **Will** is represented by a small triangle above the verb with a red border, indicating future tense.\n- **Rise** is shown as a right-angled triangle with a gradient from green to blue, pointing upwards, indicating an upward movement and verb.\n- **Tomorrow** is a small cyan triangle with a single dot pattern, attached to the verb, indicating an adverbial time reference.\n\n#### c) Challenges and Solutions\nOne challenge was differentiating between tense and aspect within the limited visual space of triangles. This was addressed by using additional smaller triangles and internal patterns to convey these grammatical features without overcrowding the symbols.\n\n### Visual Language Analysis\n\n#### a) Strengths and Limitations\n**Strengths:**\n- **Compact Representation:** The use of triangles and colors allows for compact and visually distinct symbols.\n- **Intuitive Aspect Representation:** Patterns within triangles intuitively convey grammatical aspects.\n- **Visual Appeal:** The colorful, geometric nature is aesthetically pleasing and engaging.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Color Perception:** Variations in color perception could lead to misunderstandings.\n- **Complexity:** The need for fine details (like dots and lines) may complicate quick comprehension.\n- **Limited Expressiveness:** Abstract and nuanced concepts might be harder to represent compared to written languages.\n\n#### b) Processing by the Human Brain\nThe human brain processes visual information in a different manner than textual or auditory data. Visual languages activate regions associated with spatial awareness and pattern recognition more heavily. This could lead to faster recognition but might require more cognitive load to interpret complex sentences.\n\n#### c) Representing Complex Abstract Concepts\nAbstract concepts can be represented by combining primary symbols with modifications.

Your task has the following parts:\n\n1. Visual Conlang Design (250-300 words):\n   a) Create a visual language system using triangle as the base shape and the RGB color system.\n   b) Explain how your visual language represents different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).\n   c) Describe how your language incorporates the grammatical feature of aspect.\n   d) Provide examples of at least 5 basic symbols in your language and their meanings. Describe each symbol in detail, including its shape, color, and any modifications to the base shape.\n\n2. Translation (100-150 words):\n   a) Translate the following text into your visual language: \"The sun will rise tomorrow.\"\n   b) Provide a detailed description of your translation, explaining how each visual element corresponds to the original text.\n   c) Describe any challenges you encountered in the translation process and how you addressed them.\n\n3. Visual Language Analysis (200-250 words):\n   a) Analyze the strengths and limitations of your visual language compared to traditional written languages.\n   b) Discuss how your visual conlang might be processed differently by the human brain compared to written or spoken languages.\n   c) Explain how your visual language could be used to represent complex abstract concepts.\n\n4. AI and Visual Language Processing (200-250 words):\n   a) Propose a method for training an AI model to understand and generate text in your visual language.\n   b) Discuss potential applications of your visual language in human-AI interaction or data visualization.\n   c) Explain how principles from your visual conlang could be applied to improve existing visual programming languages or icon-based user interfaces.\n\n5. Linguistic and Cognitive Implications (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss how your visual language challenges or supports linguistic theories about language universals.\n   b) Explore the potential cognitive effects of using a primarily visual language for communication.\n   c) Propose an experiment to test whether using your visual language affects spatial reasoning or other cognitive abilities.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates creativity, logical consistency, and a deep understanding of linguistics, visual design, and artificial intelligence. Use clear, concise language and provide detailed visual descriptions where necessary. Do not create or embed actual images; instead, describe visual elements textually.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section, and include a 'Visual Representations' section at the end to describe the visual elements of your conlang and translation in a structured, text-based format.\n\nYour total response should be between 1000-1250 words.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        return {\n            \"1\": {\n                \"base_shape\": \"triangle\",\n                \"color_system\": \"RGB\",\n                \"grammatical_feature\": \"aspect\",\n                \"text_to_translate\": \"The sun will rise tomorrow.\"\n            },\n            \"2\": {\n                \"base_shape\": \"circle\",\n                \"color_system\": \"CMYK\",\n                \"grammatical_feature\": \"evidentiality\",\n                \"text_to_translate\": \"I heard that it might rain later.\"\n            }\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"\"\"Design a visual constructed language (conlang) and use it to translate a given text.

Do not create or embed actual images; instead, describe visual elements textually.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section, and include a 'Visual Representations' section at the end to describe the visual elements of your conlang and translation in a structured, text-based format.\n\nYour total response should be between 1000-1250 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response provides a detailed and coherent design for a visual conlang based on the given parameters, including clear descriptions of at least 5 basic symbols.\",\n            \"The translation of the given text is logical, well-explained, and includes detailed descriptions of the visual elements used.\",\n            \"The analysis of the visual language is insightful and considers both strengths and limitations, with specific examples.\",\n            \"The discussion of AI applications and visual language processing is well-reasoned, innovative, and includes concrete examples or scenarios.\",\n            \"The exploration of linguistic and cognitive implications demonstrates a deep understanding of relevant theories and proposes a plausible, detailed experiment.\",\n            \"The response includes a structured 'Visual Representations' section that clearly describes the visual elements of the conlang and translation.\",\n            \"The overall response is creative, logically consistent, and demonstrates interdisciplinary knowledge without creating or embedding actual images.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family \"visual_conlang_generation,\" the instructions and evaluation criteria require a high level of interdisciplinary creativity and reasoning. This involves:\n\n1. Designing a novel visual language using specific shapes and color systems.\n2. Translating given text into this visual language and explaining the translation process.\n3. Analyzing the strengths and limitations of the visual language.\n4. Proposing methods for AI to understand and generate text in this visual language.\n5. Discussing the linguistic and cognitive implications of using a visual language.\n\nConsidering the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, it is generally expected that current language models may struggle with the following:\n\n- Designing a coherent and creative visual language system.\n- Translating text into a visually-based symbolic system.\n- Providing insightful analyses and innovative AI application proposals.\n- Discussing cognitive and linguistic implications with depth and accuracy.\n\nGiven these considerations, an LLM's success in this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy, as it demonstrates the model's ability to handle creative, cross-modal, and analytical tasks that require a deep understanding of multiple disciplines.\n\nDecision: Yes"
