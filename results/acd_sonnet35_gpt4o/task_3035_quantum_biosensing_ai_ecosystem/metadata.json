            "**1. Quantum Biosensing Framework**\n\n**a) Principle of Superposition and Relevance to Biosensing**\nThe quantum principle of superposition states that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured, at which point the system collapses to a single state. This principle is crucial for biosensing as it allows for the creation of highly sensitive and precise sensors that can detect minute changes in biological environments. Superposition enables quantum sensors to measure multiple parameters simultaneously, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex ecosystems.\n\n**b) Application to Forest Ecosystem Monitoring**\nIn the context of forest ecosystems, quantum biosensors leveraging superposition can monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil composition, and pollutant levels concurrently.
