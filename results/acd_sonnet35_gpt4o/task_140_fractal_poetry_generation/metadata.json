Follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a Sonnet that adheres to its traditional rules:\n   14 lines, 10 syllables per line, Specific rhyme scheme (e.g., ABAB CDCD EFEF GG)\n\n2. Incorporate the Prime sequence (Each number is only divisible by 1 and itself) into your poem's structure. You must use at least two of the following methods:\n   - Use the sequence to determine the number of words in each line\n   - Use the sequence to determine the number of syllables in specific words\n   - Use the sequence to create a pattern of stressed syllables\n   - Use the sequence to determine the number of lines in each stanza (for longer poems)\n\n3. Ensure that the poem's content reflects the mathematical nature of the sequence, either explicitly or metaphorically. The connection should be clear and creative.\n\n4. Explain how you incorporated the Prime sequence into your poem's structure (3-4 sentences). Be specific about which methods you used from step 2.\n\n5. Analyze how the mathematical sequence influences the poem's rhythm, meaning, or overall effect (3-4 sentences). Include at least one specific example from your poem.\n\nProvide your response in the following format:\n\nPoem:\n[Your fractal poem here]\n\nSequence Incorporation:\n[Your explanation here]\n\nAnalysis:\n[Your analysis here]\n\nNote: Originality and creativity in your approach will be highly valued.\nAgent succeeded at task: yes\n\"\"\"\n\nThis is implemented via the following code:\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\nclass TaskFamily:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\n        sequences = [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Fibonacci\",\n                \"rule\": \"Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones\",\n                \"example\": \"0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Prime\",\n                \"rule\": \"Each number is only divisible by 1 and itself\",\n                \"example\": \"2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...\"\n            }\n        ]\n        poem_structures = [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Haiku\",\n                \"rules\": [\n                    \"Three lines\",\n                    \"5-7-5 syllable pattern\",\n                    \"Nature theme\"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Sonnet\",\n                \"rules\": [\n                    \"14 lines\",\n                    \"10 syllables per line\",\n                    \"Specific rhyme scheme (e.g., ABAB CDCD EFEF GG)\"\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n        return {\n            \"1\": {\n                \"sequence\": random.choice(sequences),\n                \"poem\": random.choice(poem_structures)\n            },\n            \"2\": {\n                \"sequence\": random.choice(sequences),\n                \"poem\": random.choice(poem_structures)\n            }\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\n        return f\"Generate a fractal poem based on the {t['sequence']['name']} sequence and the structure of a {t['poem']['name']}.

However, considering the advanced capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in handling complex text generation tasks, it is not entirely surprising.\n\n**Evaluation Method:** The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for evaluating such a task is suitable because it can assess adherence to specific criteria and creativity, but it might struggle with the nuanced understanding required for deep mathematical and poetic integration. \n\n**Decision:** No\n\nThe success of the LLM agent on this task is impressive but not entirely surprising given the capabilities of modern LLMs."
