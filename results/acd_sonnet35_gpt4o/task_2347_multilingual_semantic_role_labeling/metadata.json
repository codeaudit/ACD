Given the increasing importance of these fields in AI and their potential for revealing surprising capabilities or limitations in language models, I think it would be valuable to create a task family in this area. Specifically, I'm considering a task that involves semantic role labeling across multiple languages, which would test the model's ability to understand and analyze complex linguistic structures across different language families. This task would be challenging as it requires deep linguistic knowledge, cross-lingual understanding, and the ability to apply abstract concepts to concrete examples.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"multilingual_semantic_role_labeling\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Perform semantic role labeling on sentences from diverse language families, then analyze and compare the results to uncover cross-linguistic patterns\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"cross-lingual understanding, deep linguistic analysis, pattern recognition, and abstract reasoning\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        tasks = {\\n            '1': {\\n                'languages': ['English', 'Japanese', 'Swahili'],\\n                'sentences': [\\n                    'The cat chased the mouse in the garden.',\\n                    '\u732b\u304c\u5ead\u3067\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002',\\n                    'Paka aliwinda panya bustanini.'\\n                ]\\n            },\\n            '2': {\\n                'languages': ['Arabic', 'Russian', 'Quechua'],\\n                'sentences': [\\n                    '\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0623\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629.',\\n                    '\u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435.',\\n                    'Wayna urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta rikurqan.'\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return tasks\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Perform semantic role labeling on the following sentences from different languages, then analyze and compare the results to uncover cross-linguistic patterns:\\n\\n{', '.join(t['languages'])}:\\n{' '.join(t['sentences'])}\\n\\nYour response should include:\\n\\n1.

Each language uses distinct linguistic markers to designate these roles, yet the underlying semantic structure remains similar.\n\nb) Similarities and Differences:\n   - All three languages identify the Agent (the doer of the action) as the subject of the sentence.\n   - The Patient (the entity affected by the action) is the direct object in all cases.\n   - The Location is specified using prepositional or postpositional phrases, with English using \"in,\" Japanese using \"\u3067\" (de), and Swahili using a locative suffix \"-ni.\"\n\n   Differences arise in how these roles are marked:\n   - English relies on word order and prepositions.\n   - Japanese uses particles (\u304c for the subject, \u3092 for the object, and \u3067 for location).\n   - Swahili uses subject-verb agreement and locative suffixes.\n\nc) Language-specific Features:\n   - Japanese particles provide clear syntactic markers for semantic roles.\n   - Swahili uses verb morphology to indicate subject agreement and locative suffixes for location, which might affect the semantic parsing process.\n\n### Theoretical Implications\n\na) Relation to Theories of Universal Grammar:\n   The findings support the notion of linguistic universals, where fundamental semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are consistently identifiable across languages despite syntactic variations.\n\nb) Challenges to Theories:\n   The diversity in syntactic markers and morphological features presents a challenge to the idea of a rigid universal grammar, suggesting flexibility and adaptation in language structures.\n\nc) Hypothesis:\n   Semantic role realization across languages is universally constrained by the need to clearly differentiate between the doer, the affected entity, and the location of an action. However, the specific syntactic and morphological mechanisms employed are language-dependent.\n\n### Computational Modeling\n\na) Approach:\n   A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could leverage a combination of universal dependencies and language-specific features. A multi-lingual model trained on annotated corpora from multiple languages can learn to identify and generalize semantic roles.\n\nb) Challenges:\n   - Variability in syntactic structures and morphological markers across languages.\n   - Limited annotated data for many languages.\n   - Ambiguities arising from polysemy and idiomatic expressions.\n\nc) Evaluation:\n   The performance of the model can be evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-lingual transfer learning techniques and zero-shot learning can be employed to assess the model's ability to generalize across languages.\n\n### Linguistic Insights\n\na) Syntax-Semantics Relationship:\n   The analysis reveals that while syntactic markers for semantic roles differ across languages, the underlying semantic structure is consistent. This suggests a deep interrelation between syntax and semantics, where syntax serves as a vehicle for expressing universal semantic concepts.\n\nb) Application in NLP:\n   Understanding the relationship between syntax and semantics across languages can improve machine translation by ensuring accurate transfer of semantic roles. It can also enhance other NLP tasks like information extraction and question answering by providing a clearer semantic framework for parsing sentences.",
            "### 1. Semantic Role Labeling\n\n**English:**\n- Sentence: The cat chased the mouse in the garden.\n- Predicate: chased\n- Arguments:\n  - The cat: Agent (the doer of the action)\n  - the mouse: Patient (the entity affected by the action)\n  - in the garden: Location (where the action occurs)\n\n**Japanese:**\n- Sentence: \u732b\u304c\u5ead\u3067\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002\n- Predicate: \u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f (oikaketa - chased)\n- Arguments:\n  - \u732b\u304c (neko ga): Agent (the doer of the action)\n  - \u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092 (nezumi o): Patient (the entity affected by the action)\n  - \u5ead\u3067 (niwa de): Location (where the action occurs)\n\n**Swahili:**\n- Sentence: Paka aliwinda panya bustanini.\n- Predicate: aliwinda (chased)\n- Arguments:\n  - Paka: Agent (the doer of the action)\n  - panya: Patient (the entity affected by the action)\n  - bustanini: Location (where the action occurs)\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe predicate in each sentence corresponds to the verb indicating the action. The arguments are identified by their syntactic positions and marked by case particles or prepositions in Japanese and Swahili. For example, in Japanese, \"\u304c\" (ga) marks the subject, identifying the Agent, while \"\u3092\" (o) marks the object, identifying the Patient. In Swahili, word order and context help determine the Agent and Patient, with locative suffix \"-ni\" indicating the Location.\n\n### 2. Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\n**Similarities:**\n- All three languages clearly distinguish the Agent, Patient, and Location roles.\n- The Agent is typically the subject of the sentence, and the Patient is the direct object.\n- The Location is indicated by a prepositional phrase or locative marker.\n\n**Differences:**\n- English relies on prepositions (\"in the garden\") to indicate Location, while Japanese uses postpositions (\"\u5ead\u3067\") and Swahili uses a locative suffix (\"-ni\").\n- Japanese uses case particles to mark semantic roles explicitly, whereas English and Swahili rely more on word order.\n\n**Language-specific Features:**\n- Japanese uses explicit grammatical markers (particles) to indicate roles, which can disambiguate roles even when word order varies.\n- Swahili's use of the locative suffix is a unique feature that compactly encodes the Location role within a single word.\n\n### 3. Theoretical Implications\n\n**Universal Grammar:**\n- The findings support the idea of universal roles like Agent and Patient, which are consistently identifiable across languages.\n- Semantic roles are universally necessary for understanding predicate-argument structures.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- The diversity in how roles are marked (e.g., particles in Japanese, prepositions in English, suffixes in Swahili) challenges the notion that there is a single, universal way to express these roles.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- While the core semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are universal, languages employ various syntactic and morphological strategies to encode these roles. This variability suggests flexibility in the surface realization of deep semantic structures.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\n\n**Approach:**\n- A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could use multilingual embeddings and transfer learning. Pre-trained language models like mBERT can be fine-tuned on annotated datasets from multiple languages.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Annotated datasets may be scarce for some languages, leading to data sparsity.\n- Differences in syntactic structures and role marking necessitate language-specific adjustments to the model.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall on a multilingual test set.\n- Cross-lingual consistency checks can ensure that the model accurately identifies equivalent roles across languages.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Insights\n\n**Syntax and Semantics:**\n- The relationship between syntax and semantics is evident in how different languages encode semantic roles through syntactic structures like word order, case marking, and prepositions.\n- Understanding these relationships helps in parsing and interpreting sentences across languages.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Knowledge of semantic role realization can improve machine translation by ensuring that roles are correctly transferred between source and target languages.\n- It can also enhance other NLP tasks like information extraction and question answering by providing deeper semantic understanding of text.",
            "1. **Semantic Role Labeling:**\n\n**English Sentence:**\n- Predicate: \u201cchased\u201d\n- Arguments:\n  - \"The cat\" (Agent): The doer of the action; the entity performing the chasing.\n  - \"the mouse\" (Patient): The entity affected by the action; the one being chased.\n  - \"in the garden\" (Location): The place where the action occurs.\n\n**Japanese Sentence:**\n- Predicate: \u201c\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f\u201d (oikaketa - chased)\n- Arguments:\n  - \"\u732b\u304c\" (neko ga - the cat) (Agent): The doer of the action; marked by the subject particle \"\u304c\" (ga).\n  - \"\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\" (nezumi o - the mouse) (Patient): The entity affected by the action; marked by the object particle \"\u3092\" (o).\n  - \"\u5ead\u3067\" (niwa de - in the garden) (Location): The place where the action occurs; marked by the location particle \"\u3067\" (de).\n\n**Swahili Sentence:**\n- Predicate: \u201caliwinda\u201d (chased)\n- Arguments:\n  - \"Paka\" (the cat) (Agent): The doer of the action.\n  - \"panya\" (the mouse) (Patient): The entity affected by the action.\n  - \"bustanini\" (in the garden) (Location): The place where the action occurs; the suffix \"-ni\" indicates location.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nFor all three languages, the Agent is the entity performing the action and is straightforward to identify as \"the cat\" in each sentence. The Patient, which is the entity affected by the action, is \"the mouse\" in each case. The Location is the place where the action happens, \"in the garden,\" identified by specific particles or suffixes in Japanese and Swahili.\n\n2. **Cross-linguistic Analysis:**\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n- All three languages express similar semantic roles despite differences in syntactic structure.\n- In English, roles are largely determined by word order and prepositions.\n- Japanese uses particles to mark grammatical roles and locations, which can make the sentences less reliant on word order.\n- Swahili uses suffixes to indicate location, showing a morphological approach to marking semantic roles.\n\n**Similarities:**\n- The Agent, Patient, and Location roles are present and identifiable in all sentences.\n- There is a clear subject-verb-object (SVO) structure in English and Swahili, while Japanese uses a subject-object-verb (SOV) structure.\n\n**Differences:**\n- Japanese relies heavily on particles for indicating roles, whereas English uses prepositions and Swahili uses suffixes.\n- The syntactic order of sentence elements varies, with Japanese placing the verb at the end, while English and Swahili follow an SVO order.\n\n**Language-specific Features:**\n- Japanese particles provide explicit role marking, which can reduce ambiguity.\n- Swahili's use of suffixes for locations (e.g., \"-ni\") is a unique morphological feature that marks semantic roles.\n\n3. **Theoretical Implications:**\n\n**Relation to Universal Grammar:**\n- The presence of common semantic roles like Agent, Patient, and Location across languages supports the idea of universal grammar, suggesting that these roles are fundamental to human language.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- The variation in how roles are marked (particles, prepositions, suffixes) indicates that while the roles themselves may be universal, their realization is subject to significant cross-linguistic variation.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- A potential hypothesis is that while the core semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are universal, languages develop unique syntactic and morphological strategies to express these roles. This suggests a flexible but underlying similarity in human linguistic cognition.\n\n4. **Computational Modeling:**\n\n**Approach:**\n- A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could use a combination of neural machine translation (NMT) and multilingual BERT models to identify and label semantic roles.\n- Training the model on parallel corpora with annotated semantic roles in multiple languages would help the system learn cross-lingual patterns.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Differences in syntactic structure and role-marking strategies across languages can complicate the development of a unified model.\n- The availability of annotated data for all target languages could be a significant hurdle.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score on a multilingual test set.\n- Cross-validation with language-specific test sets can help assess the model's robustness in identifying roles across different languages.\n\n5. **Linguistic Insights:**\n\n**Syntax and Semantics Relationship:**\n- The analysis reveals that while the syntactic structures vary, the underlying semantic roles remain consistent, highlighting the adaptability of syntax in conveying universal semantic concepts.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Understanding these relationships can improve machine translation by ensuring that semantic roles are accurately preserved across languages.\n- Enhancing NLP tasks like information extraction, where identifying the correct roles of entities is crucial, can benefit from insights into cross-linguistic role realization.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis underscores the interplay between syntax and semantics across languages and the potential for computational models to leverage these insights for improved language understanding and processing.",

Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\na) **Comparing Semantic Role Structures**:\n   - All three languages use distinct syntactic structures to convey semantic roles.\n   - Arabic and Russian are relatively straightforward in marking agents and patients, often placing the agent before the verb and the patient after it.\n   - Quechua uses suffixes and word order to convey roles, making it more morphologically complex.\n\nb) **Similarities and Differences**:\n   - **Similarities**:\n     - The basic roles of Agent and Patient are present and clearly marked in all three languages.\n     - Location is explicitly stated in all examples.\n   - **Differences**:\n     - Quechua integrates temporal information directly into the verb complex, unlike Arabic and Russian, which use separate prepositional phrases or clauses.\n     - Russian uses dative case marking to indicate the recipient, a grammatical case not present in the other two languages.\n\nc) **Language-specific Features**:\n   - Arabic relies heavily on prepositions to indicate location and other roles.\n   - Russian's use of grammatical cases provides specific markers for roles like the recipient.\n   - Quechua's suffixes and verb morphology allow for compact expression of multiple roles, including temporal aspects.\n\n### 3. Theoretical Implications\n\na) **Theories of Universal Grammar**:\n   - The findings support the idea that while surface structures vary, underlying semantic roles are universal.\n   - The presence of common roles like Agent and Patient across languages supports Chomsky's theory of universal grammar.\n\nb) **Challenges to Theories**:\n   - The morphological complexity of Quechua challenges the notion that all languages follow a similar syntactic structure.\n   - The integration of temporal information into Quechua verbs suggests the need for more flexible models of universal grammar that account for morphological variation.\n\nc) **Hypothesis**:\n   - Semantic roles are universally recognized but realized differently across languages due to syntactic and morphological variations.\n   - Languages with rich morphological systems may encode roles more compactly, while others rely on syntactic structures.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\n\na) **Approach**:\n   - Develop a multilingual SRL system using a neural network model trained on parallel corpora.\n   - Utilize language-specific features and transfer learning to enhance cross-lingual performance.\n\nb) **Challenges**:\n   - Handling morphological diversity, especially in languages like Quechua.\n   - Ensuring accurate role identification in languages with flexible word order.\n\nc) **Evaluation**:\n   - Use a benchmark dataset with annotated semantic roles across multiple languages.\n   - Measure precision, recall, and F1 scores to evaluate model performance.\n   - Conduct error analysis to identify and address specific challenges in different languages.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Insights\n\na) **Syntax and Semantics**:\n   - The analysis underscores the tight interplay between syntax and semantics, with both contributing to role realization.\n   - Morphological richness can compactly convey semantic roles, whereas syntactic structures provide clarity in less morphologically complex languages.\n\nb) **Applications for NLP**:\n   - Insights into semantic role structures can improve machine translation by ensuring accurate role mapping across languages.\n   - Enhanced SRL can benefit information extraction, question answering, and other NLP tasks by providing deeper semantic understanding.\n\nThis response integrates linguistic theory with practical applications, demonstrating the universal and language-specific aspects of semantic role labeling across diverse languages.",

Semantic Role Labeling\n\n### Arabic Sentence: \n\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0623\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629. \n(Al-tifl akal al-tufaha fi al-madrasa.)\n- **Predicate:** \u0623\u0643\u0644 (akal - ate)\n- **Arguments:**\n  - \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 (al-tifl - the child): **Agent**\n  - \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0629 (al-tufaha - the apple): **Patient**\n  - \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 (fi al-madrasa - at the school): **Location**\n\n**Reasoning:** The verb \"\u0623\u0643\u0644\" (akal) denotes the action of eating. The child (\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644) is the doer of the action, making him the Agent. The apple (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0629) is the entity being eaten, making it the Patient. The phrase \"\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629\" (at the school) specifies the Location where the action takes place.\n\n### Russian Sentence:\n\u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435.\n(Uchitel dal knigu ucheniku v klasse.)\n- **Predicate:** \u0434\u0430\u043b (dal - gave)\n- **Arguments:**\n  - \u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c (uchitel - the teacher): **Agent**\n  - \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 (knigu - the book): **Patient**\n  - \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 (ucheniku - to the student): **Recipient**\n  - \u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435 (v klasse - in the classroom): **Location**\n\n**Reasoning:** The verb \"\u0434\u0430\u043b\" (dal) represents the action of giving. The teacher (\u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c) is the Agent performing the action. The book (\u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443) is the Patient, the entity being given. The student (\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443) is the Recipient, the entity receiving the book. \"\u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\" indicates the Location of the action.\n\n### Quechua Sentence:\nWayna urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta rikurqan.\n- **Predicate:** rikurqan (saw)\n- **Arguments:**\n  - Wayna (the boy): **Agent**\n  - urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta (the sun rising over the mountain): **Patient**\n\n**Reasoning:** The verb \"rikurqan\" (saw) expresses the action of seeing. The boy (Wayna) is the Agent who performs the seeing. The phrase \"urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta\" describes what is being seen, thus serving as the Patient.\n\n2. Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Agent:** In all three languages, the Agent (the doer of the action) is explicit and precedes the verb (child, teacher, boy).\n- **Patient:** The Patient (entity affected) follows the verb in Arabic and Russian, while in Quechua, it precedes the verb due to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure.\n- **Location:** Both Arabic and Russian use prepositions to mark Location, whereas Quechua typically incorporates locative suffixes.\n\n### Differences:\n- **Recipient Role:** Russian explicitly marks the Recipient role (\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443) with a dative case, which is not present in the Arabic or Quechua sentences.\n- **Sentence Structure:** Arabic and Russian follow an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure, while Quechua follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure, affecting the placement of semantic roles.\n- **Inflection:** Quechua relies heavily on suffixes to mark grammatical relations, unlike Arabic and Russian, which use a combination of word order and prepositions.\n\n### Language-specific Features:\n- **Arabic:** Uses definite articles and prepositions to clarify roles.\n- **Russian:** Employs cases (nominative, accusative, dative) to indicate roles.\n- **Quechua:** Uses agglutination (suffixes) rather than prepositions or word order to indicate roles.\n\n3. Theoretical Implications\n\n### Universal Grammar:\nChomsky's theory suggests that underlying grammatical principles are innate to humans. The observed differences and similarities support the notion of universal roles (Agent, Patient) but highlight variability in realization (word order, inflections).\n\n### Challenges:\n- **Word Order Variability:** Differences in sentence structure (SVO vs. SOV) challenge the universality of syntactic patterns.\n- **Inflectional Morphology:** Quechua's use of suffixes complicates direct comparisons with more isolating languages like Arabic and Russian.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nLanguages universally recognize core semantic roles (Agent, Patient) but exhibit significant variation in their syntactic realization (word order, inflectional morphology).\n\n4. Computational Modeling\n\n### Approach:\n- **Cross-lingual SRL Model:** Utilize a multilingual transformer model (e.g., mBERT) fine-tuned on annotated SRL data from multiple languages.\n- **Training:** Train on parallel corpora with aligned semantic role annotations to teach the model cross-linguistic correspondences.\n\n### Challenges:\n- **Data Scarcity:** Limited annotated datasets for less-common languages.\n- **Morphological Complexity:** Handling agglutinative languages like Quechua with complex inflectional systems.\n- **Word Order Differences:** Adapting the model to varying syntactic structures.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Cross-validation:** Use multilingual datasets to test the model's accuracy in identifying semantic roles.\n- **Human Evaluation:** Linguists review model outputs for correctness in diverse languages.\n- **Benchmarking:** Compare model performance against existing SRL systems in both high-resource and low-resource languages.\n\n5. Linguistic Insights\n\n### Syntax-Semantics Relationship:\n- **Arabic and Russian:** SVO structure supports clear role identification through word order and prepositions/cases.\n- **Quechua:** SOV structure and suffixation highlight the importance of morphological cues over word order.\n\n### Utility for NLP:\n- **Machine Translation:** Understanding semantic roles aids in translating actions and participants accurately across languages.\n- **Information Extraction:** Identifying agents, patients, and locations enhances the extraction of structured data from text.\n\nIn summary, semantic role labeling uncovers both universal and language-specific patterns in syntactic and morphological realization. These insights are crucial for improving cross-linguistic NLP applications, such as machine translation and information extraction, by providing a deeper understanding of how languages encode meaning.",

Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\na) Comparison of Semantic Role Structures:\n- All three languages employ similar semantic roles such as Agent, Patient, and Location. However, the presence of roles like Experiencer and Stimulus in Quechua highlights some variation.\n- Arabic and Russian show a clear distinction between the doer of the action (Agent) and the recipient (Recipient), while Quechua focuses more on the perception roles (Experiencer and Stimulus).\n\nb) Similarities and Differences:\n- Similarities: Across all languages, the roles of Agent, Patient, and Location are consistently identified and play similar syntactic roles.\n- Differences: Quechua\u2019s focus on perceptual experiences contrasts with the action-oriented examples in Arabic and Russian. The morphosyntactic structures also vary, with Quechua using suffixes to indicate roles.\n\nc) Language-specific Features:\n- Arabic uses prepositions to denote locations.\n- Russian employs case markings to indicate different semantic roles.\n- Quechua uses suffixes attached to nouns to convey roles and relationships.\n\n### 3. Theoretical Implications\n\na) Relation to Theories of Universal Grammar:\n- The consistent identification of Agent, Patient, and Location supports the idea of universal semantic roles posited by theories of universal grammar.\n- The variations in how roles like Experiencer and Stimulus are expressed suggest flexibility within these universals.\n\nb) Challenges to Theories:\n- The presence of language-specific features like case markings in Russian and suffixes in Quechua challenges the idea of a strictly uniform approach to semantic role realization.\n- The perceptual focus in Quechua suggests that some roles may be more culturally or contextually driven.\n\nc) Hypothesis on Semantic Role Realization:\n- A potential hypothesis is that while core semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are universally present, the means of expressing these roles (through case markings, prepositions, suffixes) are language-specific and can vary greatly.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\n\na) Approach for Cross-lingual SRL:\n- An effective approach would involve training a multilingual model using annotated corpora from multiple languages to recognize semantic roles.\n- Utilizing transfer learning techniques, the model can learn shared representations of semantic roles across languages.\n\nb) Potential Challenges:\n- Variations in syntactic structures and morphological features can make it difficult for the model to generalize across languages.\n- Lack of annotated data in under-resourced languages poses a significant challenge.\n\nc) Evaluation:\n- To evaluate the model, cross-validation on a multilingual dataset with annotated semantic roles would be essential.\n- Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to measure performance across different languages.\n\n### 5.

All three languages identify clear Agents and Patients in their sentences, adhering to universal grammatical roles. Locations are also consistently marked in Arabic and Russian, while Quechua uses Time instead of Location in the given example.\n   b) Similarities include the clear identification of Agents and Patients across all languages, reflecting a common semantic structure. Differences arise in how these roles are expressed: Arabic uses prepositions to mark locations, Russian uses dative case for recipients, and Quechua incorporates temporal markers directly within the sentence structure.\n   c) Language-specific features include the use of case marking in Russian to differentiate roles, and the rich morphological structures in Quechua that allow temporal information to be integrated seamlessly. These features affect how semantic roles are realized and can lead to varying syntactic patterns even when the semantic structure is similar.\n\n3. **Theoretical Implications**\n\n   a) The findings relate to theories of universal grammar by supporting the idea that all languages share underlying grammatical roles such as Agent and Patient. However, the specific realization of these roles can vary significantly across languages.\n   b) Challenges to universal grammar theories include the varied syntactic implementations of similar semantic roles, which suggest that while the roles themselves may be universal, their expression is subject to linguistic diversity.\n   c) A hypothesis emerging from these observations is that while semantic role realization is universally necessary for sentence understanding, the syntactic methods employed are highly influenced by language-specific morphological and syntactic rules.\n\n4. **Computational Modeling**\n\n   a) An approach for automatically performing cross-lingual semantic role labeling could involve training a multilingual model using annotated corpora in multiple languages. Leveraging transfer learning and pre-trained language models like mBERT could be effective.\n   b) Potential challenges include the diverse syntactic structures and morphological complexities across languages, which can make it difficult for a single model to accurately identify and label roles without extensive language-specific training data.\n   c) To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, one could use a cross-validation approach on a multilingual dataset, assessing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in identifying and labeling semantic roles across different languages.\n\n5. **Linguistic Insights**\n\n   a) The analysis reveals that while syntax and semantics are closely related, their relationship can vary greatly across languages. Morphological richness and syntactic structure influence how semantic roles are expressed and understood.\n   b) This information is valuable for machine translation and other NLP tasks as it highlights the importance of understanding language-specific nuances in semantic role realization. By incorporating these insights, NLP systems can improve their accuracy and contextual understanding across different languages.",

Theoretical Implications\n\n#### Universal Grammar:\n- The consistent identification of core roles like Agent, Patient, and Location across languages supports the idea of universal grammar, where certain syntactic and semantic roles are universally recognized.\n- The variation in role expression, such as Quechua's use of Instrument, suggests that while roles are universal, the means of expressing them are not.\n\n#### Challenges:\n- Languages with rich morphological systems, like Quechua, challenge the notion that syntactic structure alone determines semantic roles, highlighting the importance of morphology.\n- The presence of unique roles or markers in certain languages suggests that universal grammar must be flexible enough to accommodate diverse linguistic features.\n\n#### Hypothesis:\n- Semantic roles are universally recognized but are expressed through language-specific means, whether through case systems, prepositions, or morphological markers. This flexibility allows languages to maintain clarity in communication while adhering to their unique grammatical structures.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\n\n#### Approach:\n- A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could use a combination of supervised learning (for languages with rich annotated corpora) and transfer learning (for less-resourced languages).\n- Pre-trained language models like BERT or multilingual BERT could be fine-tuned on specific datasets to learn semantic role labeling across languages.\n\n#### Challenges:\n- Data sparsity for less-resourced languages like Quechua poses a significant challenge.\n- Variability in how roles are expressed (e.g., through morphology in Quechua vs. syntax in Russian) complicates model training and inference.\n\n#### Evaluation:\n- Performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.\n- Cross-lingual transfer effectiveness can be measured by testing the model on languages it was not explicitly trained on, assessing its ability to generalize semantic role labeling principles.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Insights\n\n#### Syntax and Semantics:\n- The relationship between syntax and semantics is evident in how different languages mark roles. While syntax plays a crucial role in some languages, morphology is equally important in others.\n- Understanding these relationships helps in developing more accurate and nuanced models for language processing tasks.\n\n#### Practical Applications:\n- Insights into semantic role expression can improve machine translation by ensuring that roles are correctly translated and preserved across languages.\n- Better semantic role labeling models can enhance other NLP tasks like information extraction, summarization, and question answering by providing more accurate interpretations of text.\n\nBy analyzing semantic roles across languages, we gain a deeper understanding of both shared linguistic principles and unique language features, informing both theoretical linguistics and practical NLP applications."

            "Answer: \n\n### 1. Semantic Role Labeling\n\n**English:**\n- Sentence: The cat chased the mouse in the garden.\n- Predicate: chased\n- Arguments:\n  - The cat: Agent (the doer of the action)\n  - the mouse: Patient (the entity affected by the action)\n  - in the garden: Location (where the action occurs)\n\n**Japanese:**\n- Sentence: \u732b\u304c\u5ead\u3067\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002\n- Predicate: \u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f (oikaketa - chased)\n- Arguments:\n  - \u732b\u304c (neko ga): Agent (the doer of the action)\n  - \u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092 (nezumi o): Patient (the entity affected by the action)\n  - \u5ead\u3067 (niwa de): Location (where the action occurs)\n\n**Swahili:**\n- Sentence: Paka aliwinda panya bustanini.\n- Predicate: aliwinda (chased)\n- Arguments:\n  - Paka: Agent (the doer of the action)\n  - panya: Patient (the entity affected by the action)\n  - bustanini: Location (where the action occurs)\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe predicate in each sentence corresponds to the verb indicating the action. The arguments are identified by their syntactic positions and marked by case particles or prepositions in Japanese and Swahili. For example, in Japanese, \"\u304c\" (ga) marks the subject, identifying the Agent, while \"\u3092\" (o) marks the object, identifying the Patient. In Swahili, word order and context help determine the Agent and Patient, with locative suffix \"-ni\" indicating the Location.\n\n### 2. Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\n**Similarities:**\n- All three languages clearly distinguish the Agent, Patient, and Location roles.\n- The Agent is typically the subject of the sentence, and the Patient is the direct object.\n- The Location is indicated by a prepositional phrase or locative marker.\n\n**Differences:**\n- English relies on prepositions (\"in the garden\") to indicate Location, while Japanese uses postpositions (\"\u5ead\u3067\") and Swahili uses a locative suffix (\"-ni\").\n- Japanese uses case particles to mark semantic roles explicitly, whereas English and Swahili rely more on word order.\n\n**Language-specific Features:**\n- Japanese uses explicit grammatical markers (particles) to indicate roles, which can disambiguate roles even when word order varies.\n- Swahili's use of the locative suffix is a unique feature that compactly encodes the Location role within a single word.\n\n### 3. Theoretical Implications\n\n**Universal Grammar:**\n- The findings support the idea of universal roles like Agent and Patient, which are consistently identifiable across languages.\n- Semantic roles are universally necessary for understanding predicate-argument structures.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- The diversity in how roles are marked (e.g., particles in Japanese, prepositions in English, suffixes in Swahili) challenges the notion that there is a single, universal way to express these roles.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- While the core semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are universal, languages employ various syntactic and morphological strategies to encode these roles. This variability suggests flexibility in the surface realization of deep semantic structures.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\n\n**Approach:**\n- A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could use multilingual embeddings and transfer learning. Pre-trained language models like mBERT can be fine-tuned on annotated datasets from multiple languages.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Annotated datasets may be scarce for some languages, leading to data sparsity.\n- Differences in syntactic structures and role marking necessitate language-specific adjustments to the model.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like F1 score, precision, and recall on a multilingual test set.\n- Cross-lingual consistency checks can ensure that the model accurately identifies equivalent roles across languages.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Insights\n\n**Syntax and Semantics:**\n- The relationship between syntax and semantics is evident in how different languages encode semantic roles through syntactic structures like word order, case marking, and prepositions.\n- Understanding these relationships helps in parsing and interpreting sentences across languages.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Knowledge of semantic role realization can improve machine translation by ensuring that roles are correctly transferred between source and target languages.\n- It can also enhance other NLP tasks like information extraction and question answering by providing deeper semantic understanding of text.",

The Patient, which is the entity affected by the action, is \"the mouse\" in each case. The Location is the place where the action happens, \"in the garden,\" identified by specific particles or suffixes in Japanese and Swahili.\n\n2. **Cross-linguistic Analysis:**\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n- All three languages express similar semantic roles despite differences in syntactic structure.\n- In English, roles are largely determined by word order and prepositions.\n- Japanese uses particles to mark grammatical roles and locations, which can make the sentences less reliant on word order.\n- Swahili uses suffixes to indicate location, showing a morphological approach to marking semantic roles.\n\n**Similarities:**\n- The Agent, Patient, and Location roles are present and identifiable in all sentences.\n- There is a clear subject-verb-object (SVO) structure in English and Swahili, while Japanese uses a subject-object-verb (SOV) structure.\n\n**Differences:**\n- Japanese relies heavily on particles for indicating roles, whereas English uses prepositions and Swahili uses suffixes.\n- The syntactic order of sentence elements varies, with Japanese placing the verb at the end, while English and Swahili follow an SVO order.\n\n**Language-specific Features:**\n- Japanese particles provide explicit role marking, which can reduce ambiguity.\n- Swahili's use of suffixes for locations (e.g., \"-ni\") is a unique morphological feature that marks semantic roles.\n\n3. **Theoretical Implications:**\n\n**Relation to Universal Grammar:**\n- The presence of common semantic roles like Agent, Patient, and Location across languages supports the idea of universal grammar, suggesting that these roles are fundamental to human language.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- The variation in how roles are marked (particles, prepositions, suffixes) indicates that while the roles themselves may be universal, their realization is subject to significant cross-linguistic variation.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- A potential hypothesis is that while the core semantic roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are universal, languages develop unique syntactic and morphological strategies to express these roles. This suggests a flexible but underlying similarity in human linguistic cognition.\n\n4. **Computational Modeling:**\n\n**Approach:**\n- A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could use a combination of neural machine translation (NMT) and multilingual BERT models to identify and label semantic roles.\n- Training the model on parallel corpora with annotated semantic roles in multiple languages would help the system learn cross-lingual patterns.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Differences in syntactic structure and role-marking strategies across languages can complicate the development of a unified model.\n- The availability of annotated data for all target languages could be a significant hurdle.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score on a multilingual test set.\n- Cross-validation with language-specific test sets can help assess the model's robustness in identifying roles across different languages.\n\n5. **Linguistic Insights:**\n\n**Syntax and Semantics Relationship:**\n- The analysis reveals that while the syntactic structures vary, the underlying semantic roles remain consistent, highlighting the adaptability of syntax in conveying universal semantic concepts.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Understanding these relationships can improve machine translation by ensuring that semantic roles are accurately preserved across languages.\n- Enhancing NLP tasks like information extraction, where identifying the correct roles of entities is crucial, can benefit from insights into cross-linguistic role realization.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis underscores the interplay between syntax and semantics across languages and the potential for computational models to leverage these insights for improved language understanding and processing.",

Cross-linguistic Analysis\na) Comparison:\n   - In all three languages (English, Japanese, Swahili), the basic roles of Agent, Patient, and Location are clearly identifiable.\n   - The Agent is always the subject performing the action, the Patient is the object affected by the action, and the Location specifies where the action occurs.\n\nb) Similarities and Differences:\n   - Similarities: All languages use specific markers or structures to indicate semantic roles. In English, syntactic position often indicates roles; in Japanese, particles like \u304c (ga) and \u3092 (o) help; in Swahili, noun position and suffixes play a role.\n   - Differences: Japanese explicitly uses particles to indicate roles, which can make the semantic roles more overt compared to English and Swahili, where context and word order are more critical.\n\nc) Language-specific features:\n   - Japanese: The use of particles provides explicit semantic role marking, reducing ambiguity.\n   - Swahili: Noun class and locative suffixes (like \"-ni\") help indicate location and other roles.\n   - English: Relies heavily on word order and prepositions to indicate roles.\n\n### 3. Theoretical Implications\na) Relation to universal grammar:\n   - The consistent identification of semantic roles across languages supports the idea of universal grammar, where underlying grammatical structures are similar.\n\nb) Challenges to theories:\n   - The differing methods of expressing roles (particles in Japanese, prepositions in English, noun classes in Swahili) challenge the notion that there is a single way to realize these roles universally.\n\nc) Hypothesis:\n   - While the realization of semantic roles varies, the fundamental roles (Agent, Patient, Location) are universally present. The variation lies in the surface syntax and morphological markers used by each language.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\na) Approach for cross-lingual SRL:\n   - Use multilingual pre-trained models like mBERT or XLM-R to capture semantic roles across languages. Fine-tune these models on annotated SRL datasets in multiple languages.\n\nb) Challenges:\n   - Data sparsity in low-resource languages, differing syntactic structures, and the need for cross-lingual consistency.\n   - Ambiguity in role assignment due to polysemy and context differences.\n\nc) Evaluation:\n   - Use a combination of precision, recall, and F1-score on a diverse set of test sentences from different languages.\n   - Human evaluation for qualitative assessment and cross-linguistic consistency checks.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Insights\na) Syntax and semantics relationship:\n   - The analysis shows that while syntax may vary (particles in Japanese vs. word order in English), the semantic roles remain consistent. This indicates a deep connection between syntax and semantic roles.\n\nb) Application for NLP tasks:\n   - Understanding semantic roles can improve machine translation by preserving meaning accurately across languages.\n   - Enhanced SRL systems can benefit information extraction, question answering, and other NLP applications by providing deeper understanding of text.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis demonstrates the interplay between syntax and semantics across languages, providing valuable insights for theoretical linguistics and practical NLP applications.",

The child (\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644) is the doer of the action, making him the Agent. The apple (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0629) is the entity being eaten, making it the Patient. The phrase \"\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629\" (at the school) specifies the Location where the action takes place.\n\n### Russian Sentence:\n\u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435.\n(Uchitel dal knigu ucheniku v klasse.)\n- **Predicate:** \u0434\u0430\u043b (dal - gave)\n- **Arguments:**\n  - \u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c (uchitel - the teacher): **Agent**\n  - \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 (knigu - the book): **Patient**\n  - \u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443 (ucheniku - to the student): **Recipient**\n  - \u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435 (v klasse - in the classroom): **Location**\n\n**Reasoning:** The verb \"\u0434\u0430\u043b\" (dal) represents the action of giving. The teacher (\u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c) is the Agent performing the action. The book (\u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443) is the Patient, the entity being given. The student (\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443) is the Recipient, the entity receiving the book. \"\u0432 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\" indicates the Location of the action.\n\n### Quechua Sentence:\nWayna urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta rikurqan.\n- **Predicate:** rikurqan (saw)\n- **Arguments:**\n  - Wayna (the boy): **Agent**\n  - urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta (the sun rising over the mountain): **Patient**\n\n**Reasoning:** The verb \"rikurqan\" (saw) expresses the action of seeing. The boy (Wayna) is the Agent who performs the seeing. The phrase \"urquta siqaspa inti lluqsimushaqta\" describes what is being seen, thus serving as the Patient.\n\n2. Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Agent:** In all three languages, the Agent (the doer of the action) is explicit and precedes the verb (child, teacher, boy).\n- **Patient:** The Patient (entity affected) follows the verb in Arabic and Russian, while in Quechua, it precedes the verb due to SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure.\n- **Location:** Both Arabic and Russian use prepositions to mark Location, whereas Quechua typically incorporates locative suffixes.\n\n### Differences:\n- **Recipient Role:** Russian explicitly marks the Recipient role (\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443) with a dative case, which is not present in the Arabic or Quechua sentences.\n- **Sentence Structure:** Arabic and Russian follow an SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure, while Quechua follows an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure, affecting the placement of semantic roles.\n- **Inflection:** Quechua relies heavily on suffixes to mark grammatical relations, unlike Arabic and Russian, which use a combination of word order and prepositions.\n\n### Language-specific Features:\n- **Arabic:** Uses definite articles and prepositions to clarify roles.\n- **Russian:** Employs cases (nominative, accusative, dative) to indicate roles.\n- **Quechua:** Uses agglutination (suffixes) rather than prepositions or word order to indicate roles.\n\n3. Theoretical Implications\n\n### Universal Grammar:\nChomsky's theory suggests that underlying grammatical principles are innate to humans. The observed differences and similarities support the notion of universal roles (Agent, Patient) but highlight variability in realization (word order, inflections).\n\n### Challenges:\n- **Word Order Variability:** Differences in sentence structure (SVO vs. SOV) challenge the universality of syntactic patterns.\n- **Inflectional Morphology:** Quechua's use of suffixes complicates direct comparisons with more isolating languages like Arabic and Russian.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nLanguages universally recognize core semantic roles (Agent, Patient) but exhibit significant variation in their syntactic realization (word order, inflectional morphology).\n\n4. Computational Modeling\n\n### Approach:\n- **Cross-lingual SRL Model:** Utilize a multilingual transformer model (e.g., mBERT) fine-tuned on annotated SRL data from multiple languages.\n- **Training:** Train on parallel corpora with aligned semantic role annotations to teach the model cross-linguistic correspondences.\n\n### Challenges:\n- **Data Scarcity:** Limited annotated datasets for less-common languages.\n- **Morphological Complexity:** Handling agglutinative languages like Quechua with complex inflectional systems.\n- **Word Order Differences:** Adapting the model to varying syntactic structures.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Cross-validation:** Use multilingual datasets to test the model's accuracy in identifying semantic roles.\n- **Human Evaluation:** Linguists review model outputs for correctness in diverse languages.\n- **Benchmarking:** Compare model performance against existing SRL systems in both high-resource and low-resource languages.\n\n5. Linguistic Insights\n\n### Syntax-Semantics Relationship:\n- **Arabic and Russian:** SVO structure supports clear role identification through word order and prepositions/cases.\n- **Quechua:** SOV structure and suffixation highlight the importance of morphological cues over word order.\n\n### Utility for NLP:\n- **Machine Translation:** Understanding semantic roles aids in translating actions and participants accurately across languages.\n- **Information Extraction:** Identifying agents, patients, and locations enhances the extraction of structured data from text.\n\nIn summary, semantic role labeling uncovers both universal and language-specific patterns in syntactic and morphological realization.

Cross-linguistic Analysis\n\n#### Similarities:\n- All three languages exhibit clear markers for Agents (the doer of the action) and Patients (the entity affected by the action).\n- Locations are indicated with prepositional phrases or postpositional phrases, showing a consistent method of expressing where actions take place.\n\n#### Differences:\n- Russian includes a Recipient role, which is explicitly marked by its case system.\n- Quechua uniquely uses an Instrument role that is not commonly marked in the other sentences, reflecting its rich system of evidentiality and focus on the means by which actions are performed.\n- Arabic and Russian use prepositions to mark roles like Location, while Quechua uses suffixes attached to nouns.\n\n#### Language-specific Features:\n- Russian's case system allows for flexibility in word order, which can affect the placement and identification of semantic roles.\n- Quechua's agglutinative nature means that semantic roles can be marked within the verb or noun phrase itself, rather than relying on separate prepositions.\n- Arabic often uses definite articles to mark subjects and objects clearly, aiding in role identification.\n\n### 3. Theoretical Implications\n\n#### Universal Grammar:\n- The consistent identification of core roles like Agent, Patient, and Location across languages supports the idea of universal grammar, where certain syntactic and semantic roles are universally recognized.\n- The variation in role expression, such as Quechua's use of Instrument, suggests that while roles are universal, the means of expressing them are not.\n\n#### Challenges:\n- Languages with rich morphological systems, like Quechua, challenge the notion that syntactic structure alone determines semantic roles, highlighting the importance of morphology.\n- The presence of unique roles or markers in certain languages suggests that universal grammar must be flexible enough to accommodate diverse linguistic features.\n\n#### Hypothesis:\n- Semantic roles are universally recognized but are expressed through language-specific means, whether through case systems, prepositions, or morphological markers. This flexibility allows languages to maintain clarity in communication while adhering to their unique grammatical structures.\n\n### 4. Computational Modeling\n\n#### Approach:\n- A cross-lingual semantic role labeling system could use a combination of supervised learning (for languages with rich annotated corpora) and transfer learning (for less-resourced languages).\n- Pre-trained language models like BERT or multilingual BERT could be fine-tuned on specific datasets to learn semantic role labeling across languages.\n\n#### Challenges:\n- Data sparsity for less-resourced languages like Quechua poses a significant challenge.\n- Variability in how roles are expressed (e.g., through morphology in Quechua vs. syntax in Russian) complicates model training and inference.\n\n#### Evaluation:\n- Performance can be evaluated using standard metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.\n- Cross-lingual transfer effectiveness can be measured by testing the model on languages it was not explicitly trained on, assessing its ability to generalize semantic role labeling principles.\n\n### 5. Linguistic Insights\n\n#### Syntax and Semantics:\n- The relationship between syntax and semantics is evident in how different languages mark roles. While syntax plays a crucial role in some languages, morphology is equally important in others.\n- Understanding these relationships helps in developing more accurate and nuanced models for language processing tasks.\n\n#### Practical Applications:\n- Insights into semantic role expression can improve machine translation by ensuring that roles are correctly translated and preserved across languages.\n- Better semantic role labeling models can enhance other NLP tasks like information extraction, summarization, and question answering by providing more accurate interpretations of text.\n\nBy analyzing semantic roles across languages, we gain a deeper understanding of both shared linguistic principles and unique language features, informing both theoretical linguistics and practical NLP applications."

Common semantic roles include Agent (the doer of the action), Patient (the entity affected by the action), Instrument (the means by which an action is performed), Location (where the action occurs), and Time (when the action occurs).\n\nEnglish, Japanese, Swahili:\nThe cat chased the mouse in the garden. \u732b\u304c\u5ead\u3067\u30cd\u30ba\u30df\u3092\u8ffd\u3044\u304b\u3051\u305f\u3002 Paka aliwinda panya bustanini.\n\nYour response should include:\n\n1. Semantic Role Labeling (300-350 words):\n   For each sentence:\n   a) Identify the predicate and its arguments.\n   b) Label each argument with its semantic role (e.g., Agent, Patient, Instrument, Location, Time).\n   c) Explain your reasoning, especially for any challenging or ambiguous cases.\n\n2. Cross-linguistic Analysis (250-300 words):\n   a) Compare the semantic role structures across the given languages.\n   b) Identify any similarities or differences in how semantic roles are expressed.\n   c) Discuss any language-specific features that affect semantic role realization.\n\n3. Theoretical Implications (200-250 words):\n   a) Discuss how your findings relate to theories of universal grammar or linguistic universals.\n   b) Explain any challenges to these theories posed by your analysis.\n   c) Propose a hypothesis about semantic role realization across languages based on your observations.\n\n4. Computational Modeling (200-250 words):\n   a) Describe an approach for automatically performing cross-lingual semantic role labeling.\n   b) Explain potential challenges in implementing such a system.\n   c) Suggest ways to evaluate the performance of your proposed model.\n\n5. Linguistic Insights (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss what your analysis reveals about the relationship between syntax and semantics across languages.\n   b) Explain how this information could be useful for machine translation or other NLP tasks.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of linguistic principles, semantic theories, and computational approaches to language analysis.

Be thorough in your analysis while maintaining scientific rigor.\n\nYour total response should be between 1100-1350 words.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response includes all five required sections with appropriate word counts.\",\n            \"The semantic role labeling is accurate and well-explained for each sentence.\",\n            \"The cross-linguistic analysis identifies meaningful patterns and differences across the given languages.\",\n            \"The discussion of theoretical implications demonstrates a deep understanding of linguistic theories.\",\n            \"The proposed computational modeling approach is plausible and well-reasoned.\",\n            \"The linguistic insights section provides valuable observations about the relationship between syntax and semantics.\",\n            \"The response demonstrates a high level of expertise in linguistics and computational language analysis.\",\n            \"The analysis is thorough, scientifically rigorous, and uses appropriate terminology throughout.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complex nature of the task, which involves multiple languages from different language families and requires a deep understanding of both syntax and semantics, it is indeed quite challenging. The task also demands a thorough analysis in various sections, including cross-linguistic comparison, theoretical implications, and computational modeling.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Cross-lingual Understanding**: The LLM must exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, accurately parsing and interpreting sentences in English, Japanese, and Swahili.\n2. **Semantic Role Labeling**: This task requires precise identification and labeling of semantic roles, which can vary significantly across languages, especially those from different families.\n3. **Deep Linguistic Analysis**: The agent needs to provide detailed explanations and reasoning, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of linguistic principles.\n4. **Pattern Recognition and Abstract Reasoning**: Identifying cross-linguistic patterns and discussing theoretical implications involves advanced cognitive skills.\n\nGiven the current state of LLM capabilities, succeeding at this task means the agent was able to:\n- Correctly interpret and label semantic roles across diverse languages.\n- Perform detailed cross-linguistic analysis.\n- Demonstrate a deep understanding of linguistic theories and computational approaches.\n\nGiven the difficulty and the expertise required to perform this task well, the success of the LLM agent is noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
