Ethical Considerations (100-150 words):\n   a) Identify two potential ethical concerns related to using AI for therapy in the context of {t['therapy_area']}.\n   b) Propose safeguards or guidelines to address these concerns.\n\n5. Evaluation Method (100-150 words):\n   a) Describe a method to evaluate the effectiveness of your chatbot, focusing on both linguistic appropriateness and therapeutic outcomes.\n   b) Explain how you would measure improvements in the user's mental health state.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of both psycholinguistics and AI principles, as well as their potential applications in mental health therapy. Use appropriate terminology from both fields and provide clear, logical explanations throughout your design.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of psycholinguistic principles and their application in AI-powered therapy.\",\n            \"The chatbot design incorporates specific, relevant psycholinguistic theories or concepts.\",\n            \"The adaptive language techniques are well-explained and appropriate for the given therapy area.\",\n            \"Ethical considerations are thoughtfully addressed with relevant safeguards proposed.\",\n            \"The evaluation method effectively assesses both linguistic appropriateness and therapeutic outcomes.\",\n            \"The overall response shows creativity, interdisciplinary knowledge integration, and logical coherence.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given what I know about the capabilities of current LLMs and the nature of the task family described:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**:\n   - LLMs are generally proficient at integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines as they are trained on diverse datasets. The task requires understanding principles from AI, psycholinguistics, and mental health therapy, which could be within the reach of an advanced LLM.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving**:\n   - LLMs have shown some capability in creative problem-solving, especially when given structured prompts. Designing a hypothetical chatbot involves creativity, but the structured nature of the prompt helps guide the LLM.\n\n3. **Ethical Reasoning**:\n   - While LLMs can generate text that discusses ethical considerations, true ethical reasoning is complex and nuanced. However, the task merely asks for identification and proposal of safeguards, which is something an LLM can handle by referencing known ethical discussions in the field.\n\n4. **Understanding of Linguistics and Psychology**:\n   - LLMs can mimic understanding of complex topics by drawing from their training data. These fields are well-represented in the datasets LLMs are trained on, so generating plausible text about psycholinguistics and psychology is within their capabilities.\n\n5. **Scoring Method**:\n   - The scoring method relies on another LLM (via `eval_with_llm_judge`), which may lead to some variance in evaluation but is generally suitable for assessing whether the response meets the criteria.\n\n6. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The task is labeled as \"very difficult\" for humans due to the interdisciplinary and creative demands. Given this, an LLM's success might seem noteworthy.\n\nConsidering these points, the LLM's success on this task, while impressive given its complexity, is not entirely surprising given the structured nature of the prompt and the capabilities of advanced LLMs. \n\nDecision: No"
