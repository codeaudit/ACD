Finally, the system's outputs are evaluated by linguistic and cultural experts to ensure they align with known linguistic and cultural characteristics of the Inuit language.\n\n3. Rapid Language Learning Method:\na) Based on the AI system's analysis, a novel method for rapid language learning is proposed: immersive neural feedback training (INFT). This method combines immersive virtual reality (VR) environments with real-time neural feedback to create an engaging and effective learning experience. Learners are placed in VR simulations of the Arctic environment, interacting with virtual kinship networks and cultural practices while receiving real-time feedback on their neural activity.\nb) The INFT method leverages the neural patterns identified by the AI system by providing tailored feedback that encourages the activation of specific neural circuits associated with language learning. For example, if the system detects insufficient activation in areas related to morphological processing, it can adjust the learning tasks to focus more on word formation and structure.\nc) The method can be adapted for learners from different cultural backgrounds by customizing the VR environments and interactions to reflect their cultural contexts. This ensures that learners not only acquire linguistic skills but also develop cultural competence relevant to their target language community.\nd) For example, to teach a complex aspect of the Inuit language, such as verb incorporation (where multiple morphemes are combined to form a single verb complex), the VR environment could simulate a traditional Inuit hunting scenario. Learners would interact with virtual characters, practicing verb incorporation in context, with the AI system providing real-time feedback on their neural activity and suggesting adjustments to improve learning outcomes.\n\n4.
