Environmental conditions:
- Gravity: {t['gravity']}
- Atmosphere: {t['atmosphere']}
- Temperature: {t['temperature']}

Your task is to:

1. Organism Design (100-150 words):
   Describe your alien organism, including its physical characteristics, sensory organs, locomotion method, and any unique adaptations. Ensure these features are logically consistent with the given environment.

2. Scientific Explanation (100-150 words):
   Explain how your organism's adaptations allow it to survive in this environment. Reference real biological, physical, and chemical principles to support your design choices.

3. Ecological Role (50-75 words):
   Briefly describe the organism's ecological niche and its interactions with its environment or potential other lifeforms.

4. Potential Evolutionary Pathway (50-75 words):
   Speculate on a possible evolutionary history that could have led to this organism, considering the environmental pressures.

5. Earth Analogue (2-3 sentences):
   Identify an Earth organism with similar adaptations or survival strategies, explaining the parallels.

Ensure your response is creative yet grounded in scientific principles. Demonstrate a clear understanding of how environmental factors influence biological adaptations."""
