Interdisciplinary Implications**\n\na) **Integration of Knowledge:**\nThe MMFA integrates principles from marine biology (filter-feeding and adhesion mechanisms), materials science (biodegradable adhesives), and engineering (design and deployment of filtration systems). This interdisciplinary approach ensures a comprehensive and effective solution.\n\nb) **Applications in Other Fields:**\nThe design principles of the MMFA can be applied to freshwater systems (e.g., lakes, rivers) and industrial wastewater treatment, addressing microplastic pollution at the source. Additionally, the adhesive technology can be utilized in medical fields for bio-compatible adhesives and in construction for underwater repairs.\n\nc) **Biomimicry and Innovation:**\nBiomimicry drives innovation by leveraging nature's time-tested solutions to address modern challenges. It fosters sustainable design by promoting eco-friendly materials and processes, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration, and inspiring creative problem-solving approaches.",

Additionally, it employs adhesive surfaces inspired by mussels' byssal threads to retain the captured microplastics securely.\n\nc) **Key Components and Functionality:**  \n- **Filtration Units:** These are large, floating structures equipped with fine mesh filters designed to mimic baleen plates. They are anchored in areas with high microplastic concentrations, such as ocean gyres.\n- **Adhesive Surfaces:** The filtration units are lined with mussel-inspired adhesive materials that capture and hold microplastics. These materials are designed to be durable and resistant to marine conditions.\n- **Collection Mechanism:** Periodically, the filtration units are serviced by boats that collect the accumulated microplastics for proper disposal or recycling.\n\nd) **Sustainability and Minimizing Environmental Impacts:**  \nThe MFAS promotes sustainability by using biodegradable or recyclable materials for construction. The system is designed to be non-invasive, ensuring minimal disruption to marine life. Energy-efficient methods, such as solar or wave energy, power the filtration units, further reducing the environmental footprint.\n\n**4.
