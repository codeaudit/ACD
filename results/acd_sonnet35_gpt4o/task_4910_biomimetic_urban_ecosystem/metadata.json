            "1. Biomimetic Analysis (279 words):\n   a) Termite mounds are marvels of natural engineering, featuring sophisticated ventilation systems that regulate temperature and gas exchange. These structures maintain internal temperatures within a narrow range despite external fluctuations. Key features include porous walls, a network of tunnels, and central chimneys that facilitate passive cooling through convection and air flow.\n   b) Translating these mechanisms into urban design involves creating buildings and urban layouts that mimic the passive cooling and ventilation strategies of termite mounds. This could involve designing structures with porous materials, strategically placed vents, and central atriums that promote air circulation. Building orientations and landscape features could be optimized to enhance natural airflow and shade.\n   c) Challenges in applying this approach include the differences in scale and complexity between termite mounds and urban buildings. Human structures are subject to different environmental stresses and must meet various functional and regulatory requirements. Additionally, integrating natural ventilation systems into existing urban infrastructure may require significant retrofitting and adaptation.\n\n2. Urban Ecosystem Design (343 words):\n   a) The proposed design includes multi-story buildings with porous, breathable facades made of biomimetic materials such as perforated concrete or 3D-printed structures that mimic the porous walls of termite mounds. Each building features a central atrium that acts as a chimney, facilitating passive ventilation. The arrangement of buildings and green spaces follows a pattern that encourages natural airflow across the urban area.\n   b) This design addresses the Urban heat island effect by promoting natural cooling through enhanced air circulation and evaporative cooling from green spaces. The porous materials and central atriums reduce reliance on air conditioning, lowering energy consumption and heat emissions.\n   c) Materials include perforated concrete, green roofing materials, and sustainable building materials. Structures involve multi-story buildings with central atriums and strategically placed vents. Processes include passive cooling through convection and evaporative cooling from vegetation. \n   d) Diagram: \n      ```\n      [Roof Garden]\n          | \n      [Central Atrium]\n       /    |    \\\n    [Vent] [Vent] [Vent]\n      ```\n\n3. Integration and Scalability (210 words):\n   a) The biomimetic design can be integrated into existing urban infrastructure through retrofitting buildings with porous facades and adding central atriums where feasible. Urban planning can incorporate green spaces and building orientations that promote natural air flow.\n   b) The solution is scalable from individual buildings to larger neighborhoods by adapting the design principles to different scales. Larger areas can benefit from coordinated planning that maximizes the cooling effects of green spaces and building layouts.\n   c) Potential conflicts include existing zoning regulations and building codes that may not accommodate innovative designs. Collaboration with regulatory bodies and phased implementation strategies can help overcome these challenges.\n\n4. Environmental Impact Assessment (237 words):\n   a) The environmental benefits include reduced urban temperatures, lower energy consumption for cooling, and improved air quality due to increased vegetation. The design also promotes biodiversity by integrating green spaces.\n   b) Negative impacts might include the initial environmental cost of producing and installing new materials.
