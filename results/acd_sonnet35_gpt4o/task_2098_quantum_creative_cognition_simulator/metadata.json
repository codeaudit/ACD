Quantum noise and decoherence could affect the stability of the quantum state, making it difficult to achieve reliable results. Additionally, translating complex cognitive processes into quantum algorithms requires deep interdisciplinary knowledge.\n\n**2d) Differences from Classical Models:**\nClassical models typically rely on sequential processing and heuristic search methods. In contrast, this quantum-inspired approach leverages parallelism and non-classical optimization techniques. This allows it to explore a broader solution space more efficiently and potentially uncover novel solutions that classical models might miss.\n\n**3.
