            "**1. Conceptual Metaphor Analysis**\n\n**a) Explanation of the Conceptual Metaphor:**\nThe conceptual metaphor \"Argumentation IS Physical Space\" implies that argumentation can be conceptualized in terms of spatial navigation. This metaphor allows us to understand abstract argumentative processes by relating them to the more concrete and familiar experience of moving through physical space. Cognitive implications include the structuring of arguments as paths, the identification of positions, and the conceptualization of progress or obstacles within a debate as movement through a landscape.\n\n**b) Shaping Human Understanding and Reasoning:**\nThis metaphor shapes human reasoning by enabling individuals to frame arguments in terms of spatial relationships. For example, navigating through an argument can be seen as moving towards a goal, encountering obstacles (counterarguments), and finding routes (logical pathways) to reach a conclusion. This spatial framing helps in organizing thoughts, planning argumentative strategies, and visualizing the structure of debates.\n\n**c) Examples of Linguistic Expressions:**\n- \"Let's move forward with this argument.\"\n- \"We need to find a way around this objection.\"\n- \"His argument doesn't hold ground.\"\n- \"She mapped out her argument clearly.\"\n\n**2. AI System Architecture**\n\n**a) Key Components:**\n1. **Knowledge Base:** Stores information about physical space and argumentation.\n2. **Metaphor Mapping Engine:** Facilitates the mapping between the source domain (physical space) and the target domain (argumentation).\n3. **Reasoning Module:** Utilizes the mappings to perform metaphor-based reasoning.\n4. **Inference Engine:** Generates inferences based on the processed metaphors.\n5. **User Interface:** Allows users to interact with the system and visualize argumentation as spatial constructs.\n\n**b) Representation and Processing of Metaphors:**\nThe system represents metaphors using a structured ontology that links concepts from the source domain (e.g., paths, obstacles, destinations) to the target domain (e.g., arguments, counterarguments, conclusions). It processes metaphors by applying transformation rules that convert spatial concepts into argumentative contexts.\n\n**c) Mapping Knowledge:**\nThe system maps knowledge by identifying correspondences between spatial elements and argumentative constructs. For instance, a \"path\" in physical space is mapped to a \"logical progression\" in argumentation, while an \"obstacle\" is mapped to a \"counterargument.\" These mappings are stored in the knowledge base and are dynamically updated as new information is processed.\n\n**d) Novel Techniques:**\nA novel approach used in this system is the dynamic adaptation of metaphorical mappings based on contextual cues and user feedback. This ensures that the system remains flexible and can refine its understanding of metaphors over time. Additionally, the system incorporates machine learning techniques to improve its metaphor mapping accuracy and to learn new metaphorical relationships from large datasets.\n\n**3. Reasoning Mechanism**\n\n**a) Using the Conceptual Metaphor:**\nThe AI system uses the conceptual metaphor by interpreting argumentation tasks as spatial navigation problems. For example, constructing a coherent argument is akin to finding the shortest path to a destination, while addressing objections involves navigating around obstacles. The system applies spatial reasoning techniques to simulate and evaluate different argumentative strategies.\n\n**b) Inference Processes and Knowledge Structures:**\nThe inference process involves identifying relevant spatial concepts and translating them into argumentative terms. The system uses a combination of rule-based and probabilistic methods to generate and evaluate possible argumentative pathways. Knowledge structures include spatial ontologies and argumentation frameworks that capture relationships between concepts and their metaphorical counterparts.\n\n**c) Handling Limitations and Inconsistencies:**\nThe system handles potential limitations by incorporating multiple layers of metaphorical mapping, allowing for nuanced interpretations. It also includes a feedback mechanism where users can correct or refine the system's mappings, ensuring greater accuracy. Inconsistencies are managed by prioritizing the most contextually appropriate mappings and using fallback strategies when conflicts arise.\n\n**4. Application to Climate Change Mitigation**\n\n**a) Addressing the Challenge:**\nThe AI system can be applied to the challenge of developing effective climate change mitigation strategies. By framing the problem as a spatial navigation exercise, the system helps policymakers and stakeholders identify optimal pathways to achieve carbon reduction goals, navigate around policy obstacles, and integrate diverse viewpoints.\n\n**b) Novel Insights and Solutions:**\nUsing metaphor-based reasoning, the system offers unique insights by visualizing the complex interrelationships between different mitigation strategies as a navigable map. This helps stakeholders see how various actions (e.g., renewable energy adoption, conservation efforts) interconnect and impact the overall goal. It also identifies potential roadblocks (e.g., political resistance, economic barriers) and suggests alternative routes to circumvent them.\n\n**c) Comparison to Traditional Methods:**\nTraditional problem-solving methods in climate change mitigation often rely on linear models and quantitative analyses. In contrast, the metaphor-based approach provides a more holistic and intuitive framework, enabling stakeholders to grasp the complexities of the issue more readily. It also fosters creative problem-solving by encouraging users to think about solutions in terms of spatial navigation and exploration.\n\n**5. Evaluation and Implications**\n\n**a) Metrics for Evaluation:**\nThe effectiveness of the AI system can be evaluated using metrics such as:\n- **Accuracy:** The degree to which the system's mappings align with expert evaluations.\n- **Usability:** User satisfaction and ease of interaction with the system.\n- **Impact:** The system's ability to generate actionable insights and influence decision-making in climate change mitigation.\n- **Adaptability:** The system's capability to learn and refine its metaphorical mappings over time.\n\n**b) Potential Biases and Limitations:**\nThe chosen conceptual metaphor may introduce biases by oversimplifying complex argumentative processes or by imposing spatial constraints that do not naturally apply to all aspects of argumentation. Additionally, the metaphor may not capture the full nuance of certain arguments, leading to potential misinterpretations.\n\n**c) Broader Implications:**\nMetaphor-based AI systems have significant implications for cognitive science and AI research. They offer new ways to model human thought processes and can enhance machine understanding of abstract concepts. However, they also raise questions about the limits of metaphorical reasoning and the need for diverse metaphors to capture the richness of human cognition.\n\n**6. Ethical Considerations**\n\n**a) Ethical Implications:**\nUsing metaphor-based reasoning in AI decision-making involves ethical considerations around transparency and interpretability. Users must understand how the system derives its conclusions and the potential biases inherent in the metaphorical mappings. Ensuring that the system's reasoning processes are transparent and interpretable is crucial for ethical AI deployment.\n\n**b) Risks of Anthropomorphizing:**\nAnthropomorphizing complex systems through metaphorical thinking can lead to unrealistic expectations about the AI's capabilities. It is essential to communicate that the system uses metaphor as a tool for reasoning rather than possessing human-like understanding. This helps manage user expectations and prevents over-reliance on the AI.\n\n**c) Guidelines for Responsible Development:**\nGuidelines for responsible development include:\n- **Transparency:** Clearly explain the metaphorical mappings and reasoning processes used by the AI.\n- **User Education:** Educate users about the strengths and limitations of metaphor-based reasoning.\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly evaluate the system's performance and update its mappings based on user feedback and new data.\n- **Ethical Oversight:** Incorporate ethical oversight to ensure the system's decisions align with societal values and norms.",
            "### Conceptual Metaphor Analysis\n\n**a) Explanation of the Chosen Conceptual Metaphor and Cognitive Implications:**\nThe metaphor \"Argumentation IS Physical Space\" maps elements and structures from the domain of physical space onto the domain of argumentation. This metaphor implies that arguments can be navigated like physical spaces. Cognitive implications include the ability to conceptualize abstract arguments in more concrete spatial terms, making them easier to understand and manipulate. For instance, we talk about \"positions\" in an argument, \"attacking\" or \"defending\" points, which are spatially grounded actions.\n\n**b) How This Metaphor Shapes Human Understanding and Reasoning about Argumentation:**\nThis metaphor shapes our understanding by providing a framework for organizing and structuring arguments. It influences how we perceive the strength and coherence of an argument, guiding us to think in terms of spatial coherence (e.g., a \"solid\" argument or a \"weak\" point). It also facilitates the visualization of abstract concepts, thus aiding in clearer communication and thought processes.\n\n**c) Examples of Linguistic Expressions Reflecting This Conceptual Metaphor:**\n- \"She presented a strong case.\"\n- \"His argument falls apart under scrutiny.\"\n- \"We need to build a solid foundation for our claims.\"\n- \"They navigated the discussion skillfully.\"\n\n### AI System Architecture\n\n**a) Key Components of the AI System:**\n1. **Metaphor Database**: A repository of conceptual metaphors and their mappings.\n2. **Knowledge Representation Module**: Utilizes graph-based structures to represent arguments as spatial entities.\n3. **Inference Engine**: Processes and reasons about arguments using the spatial mappings.\n4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Unit**: Extracts arguments from text and translates them into spatial representations.\n5. **Visualization Interface**: Displays arguments in a spatial format to aid user interaction and understanding.\n\n**b) Representation and Processing of Conceptual Metaphors:**\nThe system uses a graph-based approach where nodes represent argument components (claims, evidence, counterarguments), and edges represent relationships (supporting, opposing). Spatial properties (distance, direction, strength) are encoded into these relationships, allowing the system to process arguments spatially.\n\n**c) Mapping Knowledge from Source Domain to Target Domain:**\nThe system maps elements from physical space (source domain) to argumentation (target domain) using predefined metaphorical mappings. For example, \"distance\" in physical space can represent the \"difference\" in opinions, and \"structure\" can represent the logical coherence of an argument.\n\n**d) Novel Techniques or Approaches:**\nA novel aspect is the use of dynamic graph embeddings that evolve as new information is added, maintaining spatial coherence. Additionally, the system employs reinforcement learning to optimize the spatial arrangements based on feedback from argument evaluation metrics.\n\n### Reasoning Mechanism\n\n**a) Use of Conceptual Metaphor to Reason about Argumentation:**\nThe system uses the \"Argumentation IS Physical Space\" metaphor to transform arguments into spatial configurations. By analyzing the spatial properties (e.g., proximity, alignment), the system can infer the strength and coherence of arguments. For example, closely aligned nodes may indicate strong support, while distant nodes might suggest weak connections.\n\n**b) Inference Processes and Knowledge Structures:**\nThe inference engine uses graph traversal algorithms to explore the spatial argument map. It applies logical rules to assess the validity and strength of connections, leveraging spatial cues such as \"closeness\" to prioritize certain inferences. Knowledge structures include spatial graphs and dynamic embeddings that capture the evolving nature of arguments.\n\n**c) Handling Limitations or Inconsistencies:**\nTo manage inconsistencies, the system incorporates a conflict resolution mechanism that re-evaluates spatial mappings when contradictions arise. It also uses confidence scores to weigh the reliability of different mappings, ensuring that more consistent and robust mappings are prioritized.\n\n### Application to Climate Change Mitigation\n\n**a) Addressing a Specific Challenge in Climate Change Mitigation:**\nThe challenge addressed is the public debate on renewable energy adoption. The AI system will analyze and visualize arguments for and against renewable energy, identifying key points of contention and consensus.\n\n**b) Metaphor-Based Reasoning Leading to Novel Insights or Solutions:**\nBy spatially mapping arguments, the system can highlight overlooked connections or gaps. For instance, it might reveal that arguments against renewable energy are clustered around economic concerns, suggesting a need for economic-focused counterarguments. This spatial insight guides stakeholders to address specific concerns more effectively.\n\n**c) Comparison to Traditional Problem-Solving Methods:**\nTraditional methods rely heavily on linear argument analysis, which can overlook complex interdependencies. The metaphor-based system provides a multidimensional view, uncovering nuanced relationships and fostering a more holistic understanding. This approach can lead to more targeted and comprehensive solutions.\n\n### Evaluation and Implications\n\n**a) Proposed Metrics to Evaluate Effectiveness:**\nEffectiveness can be measured through:\n- **Argument Coherence Score**: Evaluates the logical consistency of the spatial map.\n- **Engagement Metrics**: Tracks user interaction and understanding through the visualization interface.\n- **Resolution Rate**: Measures the success rate in resolving identified argument conflicts.\n\n**b) Potential Biases or Limitations:**\nBiases may arise from the initial metaphorical mappings, which could skew interpretations. There's also a risk of oversimplification, where complex arguments are reduced to overly simplistic spatial relationships. To mitigate these, continuous refinement and validation of metaphorical mappings are necessary.\n\n**c) Broader Implications for Cognitive Science and AI Research:**\nThis approach bridges cognitive science and AI, demonstrating how human cognitive processes can inspire advanced AI reasoning mechanisms. It opens new avenues for research into how metaphors shape thought and how AI can model complex human reasoning.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n**a) Ethical Implications of Metaphor-Based Reasoning in AI Decision-Making:**\nUsing metaphors in AI decision-making can lead to unintended biases, as the metaphorical framing might privilege certain perspectives over others. Ensuring transparency in how metaphors are applied is crucial.\n\n**b) Risks of Anthropomorphizing Complex Systems:**\nThere is a risk that users might over-rely on the AI's metaphorical reasoning, attributing human-like understanding to the system. This could lead to misplaced trust and poor decision-making.\n\n**c) Guidelines for Responsible Development and Use:**\n- **Transparency**: Clearly document and explain the metaphorical mappings and reasoning processes.\n- **Continuous Validation**: Regularly test and update the system to ensure accuracy and fairness.\n- **User Education**: Educate users on the limitations and appropriate use of the system, fostering critical engagement rather than blind trust.",
            "### Conceptual Metaphor Analysis\n\n#### a) Explanation of the Conceptual Metaphor\nThe metaphor \"Argumentation IS Physical Space\" implies that the process of argumentation can be understood in terms of spatial navigation. This conceptual metaphor allows individuals to interpret abstract argumentative structures through the more concrete and familiar concept of physical space.

For instance, it can identify common \"grounds\" between opposing viewpoints or suggest \"shortcuts\" to agreement by focusing on shared goals. This spatial representation makes complex policy discussions more manageable and reveals alternative pathways that might not be immediately obvious.\n\n#### c) Comparison to Traditional Methods\nTraditional problem-solving methods might involve linear analysis of arguments and data, often resulting in information overload and analysis paralysis. In contrast, the metaphor-based system provides a holistic, visual approach that emphasizes relationships and pathways, facilitating quicker and more intuitive decision-making.\n\n### Evaluation and Implications\n\n#### a) Evaluation Metrics\nEffectiveness can be evaluated using metrics such as:\n- Accuracy of metaphorical mappings (e.g., user agreement rates).\n- Efficiency in reaching consensus (e.g., time taken to resolve arguments).\n- User satisfaction and usability scores.\n\n#### b) Potential Biases and Limitations\nThe chosen metaphor might introduce biases, such as an overemphasis on spatial relationships at the expense of other argumentative aspects. Additionally, the metaphor might not fully capture the complexity of certain arguments, leading to oversimplification.\n\n#### c) Broader Implications\nMetaphor-based AI systems represent a significant advancement in cognitive science, offering new ways to model human thought processes. For AI research, these systems highlight the potential for more intuitive and human-like reasoning mechanisms, bridging the gap between abstract concepts and everyday cognition.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n#### a) Ethical Implications\nUsing metaphor-based reasoning in AI decision-making raises ethical concerns regarding transparency and interpretability. Users must understand how the AI reaches its conclusions to trust its recommendations.\n\n#### b) Risks of Anthropomorphizing\nAnthropomorphizing AI systems through metaphorical thinking might lead users to overestimate the AI's capabilities and understanding.

It processes metaphors by applying transformation rules that convert spatial concepts into argumentative contexts.\n\n**c) Mapping Knowledge:**\nThe system maps knowledge by identifying correspondences between spatial elements and argumentative constructs. For instance, a \"path\" in physical space is mapped to a \"logical progression\" in argumentation, while an \"obstacle\" is mapped to a \"counterargument.\" These mappings are stored in the knowledge base and are dynamically updated as new information is processed.\n\n**d) Novel Techniques:**\nA novel approach used in this system is the dynamic adaptation of metaphorical mappings based on contextual cues and user feedback. This ensures that the system remains flexible and can refine its understanding of metaphors over time. Additionally, the system incorporates machine learning techniques to improve its metaphor mapping accuracy and to learn new metaphorical relationships from large datasets.\n\n**3. Reasoning Mechanism**\n\n**a) Using the Conceptual Metaphor:**\nThe AI system uses the conceptual metaphor by interpreting argumentation tasks as spatial navigation problems. For example, constructing a coherent argument is akin to finding the shortest path to a destination, while addressing objections involves navigating around obstacles. The system applies spatial reasoning techniques to simulate and evaluate different argumentative strategies.\n\n**b) Inference Processes and Knowledge Structures:**\nThe inference process involves identifying relevant spatial concepts and translating them into argumentative terms. The system uses a combination of rule-based and probabilistic methods to generate and evaluate possible argumentative pathways. Knowledge structures include spatial ontologies and argumentation frameworks that capture relationships between concepts and their metaphorical counterparts.\n\n**c) Handling Limitations and Inconsistencies:**\nThe system handles potential limitations by incorporating multiple layers of metaphorical mapping, allowing for nuanced interpretations. It also includes a feedback mechanism where users can correct or refine the system's mappings, ensuring greater accuracy. Inconsistencies are managed by prioritizing the most contextually appropriate mappings and using fallback strategies when conflicts arise.\n\n**4.

It also identifies potential roadblocks (e.g., political resistance, economic barriers) and suggests alternative routes to circumvent them.\n\n**c) Comparison to Traditional Methods:**\nTraditional problem-solving methods in climate change mitigation often rely on linear models and quantitative analyses. In contrast, the metaphor-based approach provides a more holistic and intuitive framework, enabling stakeholders to grasp the complexities of the issue more readily. It also fosters creative problem-solving by encouraging users to think about solutions in terms of spatial navigation and exploration.\n\n**5. Evaluation and Implications**\n\n**a) Metrics for Evaluation:**\nThe effectiveness of the AI system can be evaluated using metrics such as:\n- **Accuracy:** The degree to which the system's mappings align with expert evaluations.\n- **Usability:** User satisfaction and ease of interaction with the system.\n- **Impact:** The system's ability to generate actionable insights and influence decision-making in climate change mitigation.\n- **Adaptability:** The system's capability to learn and refine its metaphorical mappings over time.\n\n**b) Potential Biases and Limitations:**\nThe chosen conceptual metaphor may introduce biases by oversimplifying complex argumentative processes or by imposing spatial constraints that do not naturally apply to all aspects of argumentation.

They offer new ways to model human thought processes and can enhance machine understanding of abstract concepts. However, they also raise questions about the limits of metaphorical reasoning and the need for diverse metaphors to capture the richness of human cognition.\n\n**6. Ethical Considerations**\n\n**a) Ethical Implications:**\nUsing metaphor-based reasoning in AI decision-making involves ethical considerations around transparency and interpretability. Users must understand how the system derives its conclusions and the potential biases inherent in the metaphorical mappings. Ensuring that the system's reasoning processes are transparent and interpretable is crucial for ethical AI deployment.\n\n**b) Risks of Anthropomorphizing:**\nAnthropomorphizing complex systems through metaphorical thinking can lead to unrealistic expectations about the AI's capabilities. It is essential to communicate that the system uses metaphor as a tool for reasoning rather than possessing human-like understanding. This helps manage user expectations and prevents over-reliance on the AI.\n\n**c) Guidelines for Responsible Development:**\nGuidelines for responsible development include:\n- **Transparency:** Clearly explain the metaphorical mappings and reasoning processes used by the AI.\n- **User Education:** Educate users about the strengths and limitations of metaphor-based reasoning.\n- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly evaluate the system's performance and update its mappings based on user feedback and new data.\n- **Ethical Oversight:** Incorporate ethical oversight to ensure the system's decisions align with societal values and norms.",

This conceptual metaphor allows individuals to interpret abstract argumentative structures through the more concrete and familiar concept of physical space. Cognitive implications include the ability to visualize arguments as traversable paths, positions, or territories, making abstract concepts more tangible and navigable.\n\n#### b) Cognitive Implications\nThis metaphor shapes human understanding by enabling spatial reasoning in argumentation. For instance, individuals might \"navigate through\" a complex argument, \"find a way\" through counterarguments, or \"corner\" an opponent with irrefutable points. The metaphor thus structures how arguments are constructed, deconstructed, and understood, promoting a spatial-temporal framework for cognitive processing.\n\n#### c) Linguistic Expressions\nExamples of linguistic expressions reflecting this metaphor include:\n- \"He backed me into a corner with his argument.\"\n- \"We need to find a way to address this point.\"\n- \"She navigated the discussion skillfully.\"\n- \"This argument doesn't hold any ground.\"\n- \"Let's map out the key points.\"\n\n### AI System Architecture\n\n#### a) Key Components\nThe AI system consists of the following components:\n1. **Metaphor Representation Module**: Encodes conceptual metaphors using a structured format.\n2. **Knowledge Base**: Contains domain-specific information, including climate change data and argumentation strategies.\n3. **Inference Engine**: Processes metaphorical mappings and performs reasoning.\n4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Unit**: Understands and generates human language expressions based on the metaphor.\n5. **Visualization Interface**: Represents arguments and their spatial analogs visually.\n\n#### b) Representation and Processing\nThe system uses a graph-based model to represent metaphors, where nodes represent concepts (e.g., argument points) and edges represent spatial relationships (e.g., paths, barriers). The Metaphor Representation Module translates abstract arguments into these spatial constructs, while the NLP Unit parses input text to identify and encode metaphorical language.\n\n#### c) Mapping Knowledge\nThe system maps knowledge from the source domain (Physical Space) to the target domain (Argumentation) by identifying spatial analogs for argumentative elements. For instance, an argument point might be mapped to a \"location,\" and the process of refutation might be mapped to \"moving away\" or \"blocking a path.\"\n\n#### d) Novel Techniques\nA novel aspect of the system is its use of dynamic spatial models to simulate argumentation flows, allowing real-time updates and visual feedback. Additionally, the system incorporates machine learning techniques to refine metaphorical mappings based on user interactions and feedback.\n\n### Reasoning Mechanism\n\n#### a) Use of Conceptual Metaphor\nThe AI system uses the conceptual metaphor to reason about Argumentation by treating argumentative processes as navigable spaces. When presented with an argument, the system identifies spatial constructs that correspond to argumentative elements and uses these constructs to determine possible \"paths\" for the argument to take.\n\n#### b) Inference Processes\nThe inference engine utilizes spatial reasoning algorithms to evaluate argument structures. For example, it might determine the most efficient \"path\" to reach a conclusion or identify \"dead ends\" where arguments are likely to fail. Knowledge structures such as spatial graphs and heuristic rules guide this inference process.\n\n#### c) Handling Limitations\nTo address potential limitations or inconsistencies, the system employs a feedback loop where user input and real-world outcomes are used to adjust metaphorical mappings. Conflict resolution mechanisms ensure that contradictory mappings are identified and addressed, maintaining coherence in the spatial analogy.\n\n### Application to Climate Change Mitigation\n\n#### a) Addressing a Specific Challenge\nThe system is applied to the challenge of promoting sustainable energy policies. Policymakers often face complex arguments from various stakeholders, making it difficult to navigate through differing opinions and data.\n\n#### b) Metaphor-Based Reasoning Insights\nUsing the spatial metaphor, the AI system visualizes policy arguments as a map, highlighting potential \"routes\" to consensus. For instance, it can identify common \"grounds\" between opposing viewpoints or suggest \"shortcuts\" to agreement by focusing on shared goals. This spatial representation makes complex policy discussions more manageable and reveals alternative pathways that might not be immediately obvious.\n\n#### c) Comparison to Traditional Methods\nTraditional problem-solving methods might involve linear analysis of arguments and data, often resulting in information overload and analysis paralysis. In contrast, the metaphor-based system provides a holistic, visual approach that emphasizes relationships and pathways, facilitating quicker and more intuitive decision-making.\n\n### Evaluation and Implications\n\n#### a) Evaluation Metrics\nEffectiveness can be evaluated using metrics such as:\n- Accuracy of metaphorical mappings (e.g., user agreement rates).\n- Efficiency in reaching consensus (e.g., time taken to resolve arguments).\n- User satisfaction and usability scores.\n\n#### b) Potential Biases and Limitations\nThe chosen metaphor might introduce biases, such as an overemphasis on spatial relationships at the expense of other argumentative aspects. Additionally, the metaphor might not fully capture the complexity of certain arguments, leading to oversimplification.\n\n#### c) Broader Implications\nMetaphor-based AI systems represent a significant advancement in cognitive science, offering new ways to model human thought processes. For AI research, these systems highlight the potential for more intuitive and human-like reasoning mechanisms, bridging the gap between abstract concepts and everyday cognition.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n\n#### a) Ethical Implications\nUsing metaphor-based reasoning in AI decision-making raises ethical concerns regarding transparency and interpretability.
