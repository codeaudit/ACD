1. Briefly explain the given mathematical concept and its key property (2-3 sentences).

2. Design an innovative and logically consistent economic system that incorporates this mathematical concept as its fundamental principle. Describe its key components and functioning (5-6 sentences). Include at least one mathematical equation or formula in your explanation.

3. Provide two specific examples of how transactions or economic activities would occur in this system, demonstrating the mathematical principle in action.

4. Analyze how this economic system could potentially offer insights into both mathematics and economics (3-4 sentences).

5. Discuss possible challenges in implementing or participating in this economic system and how they might be addressed (2-3 sentences).

6. Explore the potential societal implications of this mathematically-inspired economy, considering aspects such as wealth distribution, economic growth, and social structures (3-4 sentences).

7. Propose a simple experiment or simulation that could be conducted to test the viability of your economic system (2-3 sentences).

Format your response as follows:

Concept Explanation:
[Your explanation of the mathematical concept]

Economic System Design:
[Your description of the fictional economic system]

Economic Examples:
1. [First example]
2. [Second example]

Interdisciplinary Insights:
