            "Equivalent expression: So busy, I'd take help from anyone\nLogically transformed expression: So swamped, I'd even take help from a squirrel\nExplanation: The logical transformation 'intensify' means to take the original idea of being extremely busy and make it even more intense. In the original idiom, the speaker is already desperate enough to want help from a cat, which is generally not considered useful for work. By intensifying this idea, we imply an even greater level of desperation and busyness, choosing an animal even less associated with helpfulness, such as a squirrel. This enhances the sense of overwhelming busyness and desperation in a creative way while staying culturally appropriate.",
            "Equivalent expression: So busy I could use an extra pair of hands\n\nLogically transformed expression: So swamped I need an army of helpers\n\nExplanation: The logical operation 'intensify' involves taking the original meaning of being extremely busy and amplifying it to a higher degree. The original idiom expresses a high level of busyness by suggesting that one would even borrow a cat's paws, which implies a desperate need for help. To intensify this, I created an expression that suggests an even greater level of busyness by not just needing one extra pair of hands, but an entire army of helpers. This new expression emphasizes the overwhelming amount of work or tasks that require significantly more assistance, thus intensifying the original meaning.",

To intensify this meaning, I chose the comparison of an octopus, which already has several arms, needing even more. This amplifies the sense of busyness to an almost unimaginable level, suggesting an overload of tasks that even an octopus, known for its multiple appendages, couldn\u2019t handle alone. This creative expression maintains cultural sensitivity while conveying an intensified version of extreme busyness.",

To intensify this, I created an expression that suggests an even greater level of desperation and busyness by suggesting that one would seek help from a ghost, an even more improbable helper.

This doesn't have to be an existing idiom, but it should convey the same meaning in a culturally appropriate way for English speakers.\n\n3.

            "content": "Given the task family \"cross_cultural_idiom_logic,\" here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Linguistic Creativity and Cultural Understanding**: LLMs have shown substantial capabilities in understanding and generating text across different languages. They can often interpret idiomatic expressions and provide culturally appropriate translations, especially for well-known languages like Spanish and Japanese.\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning and Transformations**: The task requires the LLM to apply logical operations to the meaning of idioms, such as negation and intensification, and create new expressions. LLMs are generally proficient in logical reasoning tasks, although the added layer of cultural sensitivity could pose a challenge.\n\n3. **Complexity and Novelty**: The task is complex as it combines several skills\u2014interpreting idioms, translating meanings accurately, applying logical transformations, and ensuring cultural sensitivity in the new expressions. This is a higher-order task that goes beyond simple translation.\n\n4. **Automated Scoring with LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to evaluate the submissions. While LLM judges can be effective, there is a risk of nuanced cultural or creative elements being misjudged, either overvalued or undervalued. This could lead to false positives or negatives in scoring.\n\nConsidering the difficulty and the multiple layers of the task, if an LLM agent successfully completes it, it would be noteworthy due to the high degree of linguistic creativity, cultural understanding, and logical reasoning required. Therefore, the success of the LLM agent on this task is surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
