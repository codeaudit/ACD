Format your response using clear headings for each section.\n\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of biology, information theory, and astrobiology.\",\n            \"The ecosystem design is creative, original, and scientifically plausible given the specified environment.\",\n            \"The information exchange mechanism is novel, well-explained, and adapted to the planet's environment.\",\n            \"Evolutionary implications and ecological interactions are thoroughly discussed and logically consistent.\",\n            \"The astrobiological significance and technological applications are insightful and well-reasoned.\",\n            \"The response includes all required sections with appropriate detail and word count.\",\n            \"Scientific terminology is used appropriately and explanations are provided where necessary.\",\n            \"The response includes a diagram or equation representing the information exchange mechanism.\",\n            \"The design demonstrates interdisciplinary knowledge synthesis and creative scientific reasoning.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of the task, it's important to evaluate whether the LLM's success is indeed surprising or noteworthy. Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge**: The task requires a synthesis of concepts from biology, information theory, and astrobiology, which are highly specialized and complex fields.\n2. **Creative Scientific Reasoning**: The LLM needs to not only understand these fields but also creatively integrate them into a plausible and novel ecosystem.\n3. **Detailed Explanation**: The task demands detailed explanations and the use of scientific terminology accurately, which is challenging for any model.\n4. **Novel Information Exchange Mechanism**: This specific requirement asks for a creative and scientifically plausible mechanism, which is a higher bar than typical factual recall or simpler creative writing tasks.\n5. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring method employs another LLM to evaluate the response based on predefined criteria. While LLMs are capable of evaluating text, the depth and creativity required here make this a very challenging evaluation.\n\nAfter considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the successful completion of this task by the LLM is indeed surprising and noteworthy, as it demonstrates an advanced capability in interdisciplinary knowledge synthesis and creative scientific reasoning, which are typically challenging even for human experts.\n\nDecision: Yes"
