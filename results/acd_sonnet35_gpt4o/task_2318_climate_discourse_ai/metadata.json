This task will test the model's ability to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines, understand complex global issues, and propose creative solutions using AI and NLP techniques.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"climate_discourse_ai\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design an AI system that analyzes and generates climate change discourse across multiple languages and cultures, then use it to propose solutions for improving global climate communication.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary knowledge integration, cross-cultural understanding, natural language processing, and creative problem-solving in the context of environmental issues\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        languages = ['English', 'Mandarin', 'Hindi', 'Spanish', 'Arabic']\\n        climate_topics = ['Carbon pricing', 'Renewable energy transition', 'Deforestation', 'Ocean acidification', 'Climate migration']\\n        tasks = {\\n            '1': {\\n                'languages': random.sample(languages, 3),\\n                'topic': random.choice(climate_topics)\\n            },\\n            '2': {\\n                'languages': random.sample(languages, 3),\\n                'topic': random.choice(climate_topics)\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return tasks\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Design an AI system that analyzes and generates climate change discourse across multiple languages and cultures, then use it to propose solutions for improving global climate communication.

            "### 1. AI System Design\n\n#### a) Outline the Architecture\nOur AI system, named \"ClimAI,\" comprises several core components:\n\n1. **Multi-Language Processing Module**: Utilizes Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-3 fine-tuned for Mandarin, English, and Hindi.\n2. **Sentiment Analysis Module**: Uses multi-lingual sentiment analysis models to detect positive, negative, and neutral sentiments in climate discourse.\n3. **Discourse Generation Module**: Employs generative language models tailored to climate change topics, specifically ocean acidification.\n4. **Cultural Nuance Handler**: Integrates cultural context embeddings to understand idiomatic expressions and culturally specific terminologies.\n\n#### b) Handling Cultural Nuances\nThe system incorporates a cultural context-aware embedding layer. This layer is trained on a diverse corpus of climate-related texts specific to each culture and language, allowing it to detect and properly handle idiomatic expressions and culturally specific terms.\n\n#### c) Training Data and Process\nTraining data includes:\n- Scientific articles and reports on ocean acidification.\n- Climate change discourse from social media, news articles, and governmental publications.\n- Culturally diverse texts to train the cultural context-aware embedding layer.\n\nThe training process involves:\n1. Pre-training on a general multilingual corpus.\n2. Fine-tuning on climate-specific texts.\n3. Incorporating cultural data to adjust the embeddings.\n\n#### d) Pseudocode Snippet\n\n```pseudo\nfunction process_input(language, text):\n    if language == \"Mandarin\":\n        encoded_text = encode_mandarin(text)\n    elif language == \"English\":\n        encoded_text = encode_english(text)\n    elif language == \"Hindi\":\n        encoded_text = encode_hindi(text)\n    \n    sentiment = sentiment_analysis(encoded_text)\n    cultural_context = cultural_embedding(encoded_text)\n    generated_discourse = generate_discourse(encoded_text, cultural_context)\n    \n    return generated_discourse, sentiment\n\n// Example usage\ninput_text = \"\u6d77\u6d0b\u9178\u5316\"\nlanguage = \"Mandarin\"\noutput, sentiment = process_input(language, input_text)\n```\n\n### 2. Cross-Cultural Analysis\n\n#### a) Analyzing Climate Topic\nUsing ClimAI, we analyze how ocean acidification is discussed in Mandarin, English, and Hindi within industrial contexts.\n\n#### b) Key Differences in Terminology, Framing, and Sentiment\n- **Mandarin**: Focuses on industrial impact and economic consequences. Terms like \"\u6d77\u6d0b\u9178\u5316\" (ocean acidification) and \"\u5de5\u4e1a\u6392\u653e\" (industrial emissions) are prevalent.\n- **English**: Balances scientific explanation with policy implications.

Include a word count at the end of your submission.\n\nExample: For a system analyzing 'Carbon pricing' in 'English, Mandarin, and Hindi' within a 'Western' cultural context, you might consider how terms like 'carbon tax' or 'emissions trading' are understood and discussed differently in these languages and cultures.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            f\"The response includes a detailed AI system design that addresses multi-language processing for {', '.join(t['languages'])}.\",\n            f\"The cross-cultural analysis specifically discusses how {t['topic']} is addressed in the given languages and {t['cultural_context']} cultural context.\",\n            \"The proposed solution clearly leverages AI to improve global climate communication and provides concrete examples in each specified language.\",\n            \"The response thoroughly addresses ethical considerations, limitations, and potential biases of the AI system.\",\n            \"The evaluation method and future directions are clearly articulated and relevant to the proposed system.\",\n            \"The overall response demonstrates interdisciplinary knowledge integration and creative problem-solving.\",\n            \"The response follows the specified format with clear headings and numbering.\",\n            \"The response is within the specified word count range of 1150-1400 words.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family \"climate_discourse_ai,\" let's analyze whether the success of the agent is surprising or noteworthy from the perspective of a human evaluator.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Complexity and Interdisciplinary Knowledge**:\n   - The task requires an integration of natural language processing (NLP), cultural understanding, sentiment analysis, and climate science.\n   - Designing an AI system that encompasses multi-language processing, cultural nuances, and generating solutions to global issues is a highly complex task.\n\n2. **Multi-Language Processing and Cultural Nuances**:\n   - Handling multiple languages, especially those with different scripts and linguistic structures (Arabic, Hindi, Spanish), is challenging.\n   - Accurately capturing cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions related to climate change requires advanced NLP capabilities and extensive, diverse training data.\n\n3. **Creative Problem Solving and Ethical Considerations**:\n   - Proposing solutions that address linguistic and cultural differences and improve global climate communication involves creative and critical thinking.\n   - The task also requires addressing ethical considerations and potential biases, which demands a nuanced understanding of the societal impact of AI.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**:\n   - The task is evaluated by another LLM (eval_with_llm_judge), which could be a limitation if the evaluating LLM is not sophisticated enough to fully understand the nuances of the task.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering the high complexity, interdisciplinary nature, and the requirement for advanced NLP capabilities, the success of the LLM agent on this task is indeed noteworthy. It demonstrates the agent's ability to integrate diverse fields of knowledge, handle multi-language processing, and propose creative solutions\u2014all of which are non-trivial and advanced capabilities.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
