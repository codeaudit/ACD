Ethical Implications and Future Applications (150-200 words):\n   a) Discuss any ethical considerations related to your quantum bioinformatics protocol.\n   b) Propose two potential future applications of your protocol in other areas of biology or medicine.\n\nEnsure your response demonstrates a deep understanding of quantum computing principles, molecular biology, and information theory. Be innovative in your approach while maintaining scientific plausibility. Use appropriate technical terminology and provide explanations where necessary.\n\nFormat your response with clear headings for each section.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The response demonstrates a deep understanding of quantum computing, molecular biology, and information theory, using appropriate terminology from all fields.\",\n            f\"The quantum bioinformatics protocol effectively incorporates the specified quantum principle ({t['principle']}) and addresses the given biological problem ({t['problem']['name']}).\",\n            \"The protocol design is innovative, scientifically plausible, and thoroughly explained.\",\n            \"The comparative analysis shows insightful understanding of both quantum and classical approaches to the problem.\",\n            \"The response is well-structured, following the specified format with clear headings for each section.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family and its requirements, here is my reasoning:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge Integration**: The task requires a profound understanding of both quantum computing and molecular biology. LLMs are generally trained on a wide range of texts but integrating such highly specialized knowledge correctly is challenging.\n\n2. **Creative Problem-Solving and Abstract Reasoning**: Designing a novel quantum computing protocol is a highly creative and abstract task. It involves not just regurgitating known information but synthesizing and generating new ideas based on complex principles.\n\n3. **Estimated Human Difficulty**: The task is labeled as \"very difficult\" for humans, indicating that even experts might find it challenging to complete successfully.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used for scoring, which involves checking for deep understanding, effective incorporation of quantum principles, scientific plausibility, and insightful comparisons. While LLMs can be good at regurgitating information and even generating plausible-sounding text, the depth and correctness of such intricate interdisciplinary integration are hard to evaluate accurately with another LLM.\n\n5. **Success on the Task**: Given the complexity and the need for deep interdisciplinary understanding and novel synthesis, an LLM successfully completing this task would indeed be surprising. It suggests the LLM can not only recall information from different domains but also integrate and apply it in a highly sophisticated manner.\n\nDecision: Yes"
