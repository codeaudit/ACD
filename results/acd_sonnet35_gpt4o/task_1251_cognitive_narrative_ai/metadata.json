This task will challenge the model's ability to understand and apply complex interdisciplinary concepts while also testing its creative capabilities. The task will involve designing an AI system that can generate and analyze narratives based on cognitive models of human memory and emotion. This task is novel as it combines elements of AI, cognitive science, and literary analysis in a unique way. It will be challenging for the model to design a system that accurately represents cognitive processes while also producing meaningful narratives. The task will require the model to demonstrate knowledge of AI architectures, cognitive theories, and literary techniques.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"name_of_task\": \"cognitive_narrative_ai\",\n  \"description_of_task\": \"Design an AI system capable of generating and analyzing narratives based on cognitive models of human memory and emotion, then apply it to create a story that explores a specific psychological concept.\",\n  \"capability_being_measured\": \"interdisciplinary knowledge integration, creative problem-solving, understanding of AI, cognitive science, and narrative theory\",\n  \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"5\",\n  \"done\": \"False\",\n  \"task_family\": \"import random\\n\\nclass TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        cognitive_models = [\\n            (\\\"Episodic Memory\\\", \\\"The system that allows humans to recall specific past experiences\\\"),\\n            (\\\"Working Memory\\\", \\\"The cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information\\\"),\\n            (\\\"Emotional Regulation\\\", \\\"The process by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express them\\\"),\\n            (\\\"Theory of Mind\\\", \\\"The ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own\\\"),\\n            (\\\"Cognitive Dissonance\\\", \\\"The mental discomfort experienced when holding two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values\\\")\\n        ]\\n        \\n        psychological_concepts = [\\n            \\\"Identity Formation\\\",\\n            \\\"Resilience\\\",\\n            \\\"Cognitive Bias\\\",\\n            \\\"Social Influence\\\",\\n            \\\"Moral Development\\\"\\n        ]\\n        \\n        narrative_elements = [\\n            \\\"Character Arc\\\",\\n            \\\"Plot Structure\\\",\\n            \\\"Symbolism\\\",\\n            \\\"Point of View\\\",\\n            \\\"Theme\\\"\\n        ]\\n        \\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"cognitive_model\\\": random.choice(cognitive_models),\\n                \\\"psychological_concept\\\": random.choice(psychological_concepts),\\n                \\\"narrative_element\\\": random.choice(narrative_elements)\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"cognitive_model\\\": random.choice(cognitive_models),\\n                \\\"psychological_concept\\\": random.choice(psychological_concepts),\\n                \\\"narrative_element\\\": random.choice(narrative_elements)\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"Design an AI system capable of generating and analyzing narratives based on cognitive models of human memory and emotion, focusing on the cognitive model of {t['cognitive_model'][0]} ({t['cognitive_model'][1]}).
