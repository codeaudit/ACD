            "### 1. Theoretical Framework\n\n#### a) Quantum Principle and Biological Process\nThe quantum principle of coherence refers to the superposition of quantum states, allowing particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. In photosynthesis, coherence plays a significant role in the efficiency of energy transfer within the photosynthetic complexes. Specifically, it is believed that quantum coherence allows for the wave-like movement of excitons (energy carriers) through the light-harvesting complexes, optimizing the energy transfer from absorbed photons to the reaction centers where chemical energy is produced.\n\n#### b) Quantum-Biological Interaction as a Biosignature\nIf quantum coherence significantly enhances photosynthetic efficiency, it would result in distinct spectral signatures. These spectral signatures could manifest as sharper absorption features in certain wavelengths, indicative of the highly efficient energy transfer systems driven by quantum coherence. Detecting these unique spectral patterns, especially in the visible and near-infrared regions, could serve as a biosignature of photosynthetic activity on exoplanets.\n\n#### c) Planetary Condition and Quantum-Biological Process\nThe atmospheric composition of a planet can profoundly influence the quantum-biological processes. For instance, the presence of certain gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide is essential for photosynthesis. Additionally, atmospheric conditions such as temperature and pressure can affect the stability and efficiency of quantum coherence in biological systems. For example, extremely high temperatures might disrupt coherence, while a stable, oxygen-rich atmosphere could support robust photosynthetic activity.\n\n### 2.
