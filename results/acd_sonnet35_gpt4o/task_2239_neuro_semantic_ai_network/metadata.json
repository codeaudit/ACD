            "1. Neurolinguistic Foundation:\n   a) The neurolinguistic principles underlying semantic networks in the human brain are centered around the interconnected nodes representing concepts and their relationships. These networks are thought to be organized based on associative learning, where frequently co-occurring concepts strengthen their neural connections. The hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe structures are critical for forming these associations, while the prefrontal cortex is involved in the retrieval and manipulation of semantic information.\n   b) Polysemy, the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings, is represented in the brain by the activation of overlapping but distinct neural circuits. When a polysemous word is encountered, the brain activates a core lexical representation and then recruits additional contextual information from surrounding neural networks to disambiguate the specific meaning.\n   c) Limited working memory affects semantic processing by constraining the amount of information that can be actively maintained and manipulated. This limitation can lead to difficulties in parsing sentences with multiple polysemous words or complex structures, as the brain must efficiently allocate cognitive resources to resolve ambiguities and maintain coherence.\n\n2. AI System Architecture:\n   a) The AI architecture designed to model semantic networks is based on a graph neural network (GNN) framework. This framework consists of nodes representing concepts and edges representing semantic relationships. The network is trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to capture the associative strengths between concepts.\n   b) Polysemy is represented in the system by allowing nodes to have multiple state representations, each corresponding to a different sense of the word. Contextual embeddings are used to determine the appropriate sense based on surrounding words, similar to how the human brain utilizes context.\n   c) To implement the cognitive constraint of limited working memory, the system employs a memory-augmented neural network with a fixed-size memory buffer. This buffer stores a limited number of recent contextual embeddings, ensuring that the system can only consider a finite amount of context at any given time, mimicking human working memory limitations.\n   d) The system\u2019s structure includes an input layer for word embeddings, a GNN layer for semantic network processing, a memory buffer for context management, and an output layer for disambiguated word senses. The GNN layer updates node states based on context, while the memory buffer ensures that only the most relevant context is used for disambiguation.\n\n3. Application to Language Task:\n   a) The AI system approaches word sense disambiguation by first embedding the input text into a high-dimensional space using pre-trained word embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into the GNN, which updates the semantic network based on the input context.\n   b) Steps:\n      1. Input text is tokenized and converted to embeddings.\n      2. Embeddings are passed through the GNN to update node states.\n      3. The memory buffer maintains recent contextual embeddings.\n      4. The system uses the updated node states and memory buffer to disambiguate the senses of polysemous words.\n      5. Disambiguated senses are outputted along with the original text.\n   c) The limited working memory constraint affects performance by ensuring the system can only use a finite context window, which may lead to errors in disambiguation when long-distance dependencies are present.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Compared to traditional NLP approaches, such as those using static word embeddings or rule-based systems, the neuro-semantic AI system provides a more dynamic and context-sensitive method for word sense disambiguation. Traditional methods often struggle with polysemy as they lack contextual adaptability.\n   b) Advantages include better handling of context and more human-like processing, while limitations involve computational complexity and potential difficulties in scaling to large datasets.\n   c) An experiment to evaluate the system could involve a benchmark dataset for word sense disambiguation, comparing performance against human annotators and traditional NLP systems. Metrics would include accuracy, processing time, and error analysis.\n\n5. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n   a) Ethical considerations include ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate biases present in the training data and maintaining transparency in how decisions are made. There is also a need to respect user privacy and avoid misuse of cognitive modeling for manipulative purposes.\n   b) Potential societal impacts include improved natural language understanding in technologies like virtual assistants and translation services, leading to better human-computer interaction. However, there is also the risk of job displacement and increased surveillance capabilities.\n   c) Guidelines for responsible development include promoting fairness and inclusivity, ensuring transparency and explainability, and establishing regulations to prevent misuse. Continuous monitoring and updating of AI systems to align with ethical standards are also essential.",
            "1. Neurolinguistic Foundation:\n   a) Neurolinguistic principles suggest that semantic networks in the human brain are organized through interconnected nodes representing concepts. These networks are supported by associative links formed through experiences and language exposure. The brain uses these connections to retrieve and process meaning.\n   b) Polysemy, the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings, is represented in the brain by overlapping neural circuits. When a polysemous word is encountered, the brain activates a network of related meanings and uses contextual cues to disambiguate the correct sense.\n   c) Limited working memory constrains the amount of information the brain can process simultaneously. This affects semantic processing by necessitating efficient management of cognitive resources. The brain prioritizes relevant information and employs strategies like chunking to handle complex semantic tasks.\n\n2. AI System Architecture:\n   a) The AI architecture consists of a neural network that mimics human semantic networks. It uses layers of nodes representing concepts, with weighted connections reflecting the strength of associations. This network is trained on large datasets to develop a rich, interconnected semantic map.\n   b) Polysemy is represented by nodes with multiple weighted links to different context nodes. When processing a polysemous word, the system activates related nodes and uses contextual inputs to determine the appropriate meaning.\n   c) To incorporate limited working memory, the system includes a gating mechanism that limits the number of active nodes at any given time. This simulates human cognitive constraints by prioritizing the most relevant information based on context.\n   d) The system's structure includes an input layer for text, hidden layers for semantic processing, and an output layer for disambiguated word senses. A gating mechanism regulates node activation. (Include diagram with input, hidden, and output layers, and gating mechanism.)\n\n3. Application to Language Task:\n   a) For word sense disambiguation (WSD), the AI system processes input text to identify polysemous words. It activates related semantic nodes and uses contextual information to select the correct sense.\n   b) Step-by-step: \n      - Input text is processed to identify polysemous words.\n      - Contextual information is extracted from surrounding text.\n      - Relevant semantic nodes are activated based on the polysemous word and context.\n      - The gating mechanism limits node activation to manage working memory constraints.\n      - The system selects the most contextually appropriate sense and generates the output.\n   c) Limited working memory affects performance by requiring the system to efficiently manage node activation, ensuring only the most relevant information is considered for disambiguation.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Traditional NLP approaches to WSD often rely on rule-based methods or statistical models. The neuro-semantic AI system, by contrast, uses a dynamically activated semantic network that mimics human cognitive processes.\n   b) Advantages include more accurate sense disambiguation due to contextual processing and cognitive constraint management. Limitations may involve higher computational complexity and the need for extensive training data.\n   c) An experiment could involve comparing the system's WSD accuracy with human performance and traditional NLP methods on a standardized dataset. Metrics would include disambiguation accuracy, processing time, and resource usage.\n\n5. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n   a) Ethical considerations include ensuring transparency in AI decision-making processes and avoiding biases that may arise from training data. It's crucial to address privacy concerns and the potential misuse of AI.\n   b) Societal impacts include improved language understanding in AI applications, enhancing communication technologies, and potentially replacing human roles in language-related tasks.\n   c) Guidelines should promote fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI development. Regular audits, inclusive training datasets, and clear communication of AI capabilities and limitations are essential for responsible use.",
            "1. Neurolinguistic Foundation:\n   a) Neurolinguistic principles suggest that semantic networks in the human brain are organized in a manner that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of meaning. These networks are formed through associative links between related concepts, often represented as nodes in a cognitive map. The brain uses a combination of sensory, motor, and linguistic inputs to build these networks, which are constantly updated through experiences and learning. The principle of spreading activation explains how thinking of one concept can activate related concepts, facilitating rapid access to information.\n   \n   b) Polysemy, the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings, is represented in the brain through overlapping neural circuits. For example, the word \"bank\" can refer to a financial institution or a river bank. The brain processes polysemy by contextually activating different nodes within the semantic network, allowing it to discern the intended meaning based on surrounding words and prior knowledge.\n\n   c) Limited working memory affects semantic processing by constraining the amount of information that can be actively held and manipulated at any given time. This limitation necessitates efficient strategies for information retrieval and processing, often relying on heuristics and context to quickly infer meanings without overloading cognitive resources.\n\n2. AI System Architecture:\n   a) The AI architecture designed to model semantic networks is inspired by the human brain's associative learning and spreading activation. The system consists of interconnected nodes representing concepts, with weighted edges indicating the strength of associations. The architecture includes layers for sensory inputs, context processing, and semantic memory, mimicking the brain's hierarchical structure for information processing.\n\n   b) In this AI system, polysemy is represented by creating multiple sub-nodes for each polysemous word, each linked to different contexts and meanings. The system uses a context analysis module to determine which sub-node to activate based on the input sentence, ensuring accurate sense disambiguation.\n\n   c) To implement the cognitive constraint of limited working memory, the system incorporates a memory management module that prioritizes and limits the number of active nodes and edges at any time. This module uses algorithms to dynamically allocate memory resources, ensuring efficient processing without overloading.\n\n   d) Diagram: [Imagine a multi-layer neural network structure where input nodes represent sensory data, hidden layers process context and semantics, and output nodes generate disambiguated word senses. The memory management module interacts with all layers to regulate the flow of information.]\n\n3. Application to Language Task:\n   a) For word sense disambiguation, the AI system first preprocesses the input text to identify polysemous words. It then uses the context analysis module to activate the most relevant sub-node for each polysemous word, based on surrounding words and overall sentence meaning.\n\n   b) Step-by-step process:\n      i. Input text is tokenized and parsed.\n      ii. Polysemous words are identified.\n      iii. Context analysis module evaluates surrounding words.\n      iv. Relevant sub-node for each polysemous word is activated.\n      v. Disambiguated word senses are outputted.\n\n   c) The cognitive constraint of limited working memory affects performance by necessitating efficient context evaluation and memory allocation. The system must quickly prioritize relevant information, sometimes sacrificing exhaustive analysis for speed and efficiency.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Traditional NLP approaches often rely on static word sense inventories and rule-based disambiguation, while the neuro-semantic AI system leverages dynamic, context-sensitive processing. This allows for more flexible and accurate disambiguation, especially in complex or ambiguous contexts.\n   \n   b) Potential advantages include improved accuracy and adaptability, while limitations may involve computational complexity and resource requirements. The neuro-semantic approach may also struggle with novel or less common contexts where associative links are weaker.\n\n   c) An experiment to evaluate the system could involve comparing its performance on a standardized word sense disambiguation task against human subjects and traditional NLP models. Metrics such as accuracy, processing time, and cognitive load could be assessed to determine overall effectiveness.\n\n5. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n   a) Ethical considerations include ensuring transparency, avoiding biases, and maintaining user privacy. Developing AI systems that mimic human cognition raises concerns about accountability and the potential misuse of such technology.\n   \n   b) Societal impacts could include advancements in education, communication, and accessibility. However, there is also the risk of deepening digital divides and the potential for job displacement in language-related fields.\n\n   c) Guidelines for responsible development should include ethical AI principles, robust testing and validation, and ongoing monitoring for unintended consequences. Collaboration with interdisciplinary experts and stakeholders can help ensure that the technology is used for the benefit of society as a whole.",
            "1. Neurolinguistic Foundation\na) Semantic networks in the human brain are grounded on the principle that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes within a vast web of associations. These networks are formed and reorganized through experience, such that related concepts (e.g., \"apple\" and \"fruit\") have stronger and more direct connections. The spreading activation theory explains how activating one node can trigger the activation of related nodes, facilitating retrieval of associated information. This interconnected structure allows for efficient processing and retrieval of semantic information.\n\nb) Polysemy, the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings (e.g., \"bank\" as a financial institution and \"bank\" as the side of a river), is represented in the brain through overlapping but distinct neural circuits. Each meaning of a polysemous word activates a distinct but connected sub-network within the larger semantic network. Contextual cues help disambiguate which meaning is intended, with the brain rapidly shifting activation patterns based on the surrounding words and situational context.\n\nc) Limited working memory affects semantic processing by constraining the amount of information that can be actively held and manipulated at any one time. This restriction necessitates efficient use of cognitive resources, often leading to reliance on heuristics and context to quickly disambiguate meanings. When working memory is taxed, the brain may struggle to maintain multiple possible meanings simultaneously, leading to slower or less accurate processing.\n\n2. AI System Architecture\na) The AI architecture designed to model human semantic networks is based on a neural network with a structure mimicking the interconnected nature of human semantic networks. Nodes represent concepts and edges represent the strength of associations between them. This network is trained using large corpora of text to learn the relationships between words and their contexts, forming a dynamic and flexible representation of semantics.\n\nb) Polysemy is represented in the system through a multi-layered approach where each layer corresponds to different contexts in which a word appears. Each polysemous word has a central node with multiple connected sub-nodes representing its different meanings. Contextual information is used to activate the appropriate sub-node, mirroring the brain's use of context to disambiguate meanings.\n\nc) To account for limited working memory, the system employs a mechanism that limits the number of active nodes and edges at any given time. A dynamic attention model prioritizes and maintains the most relevant nodes based on context, ensuring that the system remains efficient and focused, akin to human cognitive constraints.\n\nd) The system's structure includes:\n   - Input Layer: Processes raw text input.\n   - Contextual Embedding Layer: Encodes contextual information.\n   - Semantic Network Layer: Represents and activates semantic nodes.\n   - Attention Mechanism: Manages active nodes to simulate working memory limits.\n   - Output Layer: Generates disambiguated word senses.\n\n3. Application to Language Task\na) For the task of word sense disambiguation (WSD), the AI system leverages its semantic network to interpret the correct meaning of a polysemous word based on context. The system processes input sentences, identifies polysemous words, and uses contextual embeddings to determine the most relevant meaning.\n\nb) Step-by-step processing:\n   1. Input sentence is tokenized and fed into the contextual embedding layer.\n   2. Contextual embeddings are generated, highlighting the surrounding words.\n   3. The semantic network layer activates nodes corresponding to the polysemous word and its potential meanings.\n   4. The attention mechanism focuses on the most contextually relevant nodes, simulating working memory constraints.\n   5. The output layer selects and outputs the most appropriate word sense.\n\nc) The cognitive constraint of limited working memory affects the system's performance by ensuring that only the most contextually relevant information is considered at any time. This constraint helps the system maintain efficiency and avoid overloading its processing capacity, leading to faster and more accurate disambiguation.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\na) Compared to traditional NLP approaches, which often rely on static word sense inventories and context-independent algorithms, the neuro-semantic AI system offers a dynamic and context-aware method for WSD. Traditional methods may struggle with nuanced or ambiguous contexts, whereas the neuro-semantic approach adapts based on contextual cues.\n\nb) Advantages of the neuro-semantic approach include more accurate disambiguation in varied contexts and better modeling of human-like semantic processing. Limitations may include higher computational complexity and the need for extensive training data to capture nuanced meanings.\n\nc) An experiment to evaluate the system could involve comparing its WSD accuracy against human performance and traditional NLP methods on a standardized dataset. Participants could be asked to disambiguate words in context, and their responses would be compared to the AI system's outputs.\n\n5. Ethical and Societal Implications\na) Ethical considerations in developing AI systems that closely mimic human cognitive processes include ensuring transparency in decision-making, avoiding biases in training data, and protecting user privacy. It's important to consider how these systems might influence human behavior and decision-making.\n\nb) Societal impacts of advanced semantic processing AI include improved natural language understanding in applications like virtual assistants, translation services, and educational tools. However, there is also the risk of misuse in areas like surveillance or manipulation of information.\n\nc) Guidelines for responsible development and use of neuro-semantic AI systems include establishing ethical standards for training data, implementing robust privacy protections, ensuring transparency in AI decision-making, and promoting inclusivity to avoid biases.

            "Answer: \n1. Neurolinguistic Foundation\na) Semantic networks in the human brain are grounded on the principle that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes within a vast web of associations. These networks are formed and reorganized through experience, such that related concepts (e.g., \"apple\" and \"fruit\") have stronger and more direct connections. The spreading activation theory explains how activating one node can trigger the activation of related nodes, facilitating retrieval of associated information. This interconnected structure allows for efficient processing and retrieval of semantic information.\n\nb) Polysemy, the phenomenon where a single word has multiple related meanings (e.g., \"bank\" as a financial institution and \"bank\" as the side of a river), is represented in the brain through overlapping but distinct neural circuits. Each meaning of a polysemous word activates a distinct but connected sub-network within the larger semantic network. Contextual cues help disambiguate which meaning is intended, with the brain rapidly shifting activation patterns based on the surrounding words and situational context.\n\nc) Limited working memory affects semantic processing by constraining the amount of information that can be actively held and manipulated at any one time. This restriction necessitates efficient use of cognitive resources, often leading to reliance on heuristics and context to quickly disambiguate meanings. When working memory is taxed, the brain may struggle to maintain multiple possible meanings simultaneously, leading to slower or less accurate processing.\n\n2. AI System Architecture\na) The AI architecture designed to model human semantic networks is based on a neural network with a structure mimicking the interconnected nature of human semantic networks. Nodes represent concepts and edges represent the strength of associations between them. This network is trained using large corpora of text to learn the relationships between words and their contexts, forming a dynamic and flexible representation of semantics.\n\nb) Polysemy is represented in the system through a multi-layered approach where each layer corresponds to different contexts in which a word appears. Each polysemous word has a central node with multiple connected sub-nodes representing its different meanings. Contextual information is used to activate the appropriate sub-node, mirroring the brain's use of context to disambiguate meanings.\n\nc) To account for limited working memory, the system employs a mechanism that limits the number of active nodes and edges at any given time. A dynamic attention model prioritizes and maintains the most relevant nodes based on context, ensuring that the system remains efficient and focused, akin to human cognitive constraints.\n\nd) The system's structure includes:\n   - Input Layer: Processes raw text input.\n   - Contextual Embedding Layer: Encodes contextual information.\n   - Semantic Network Layer: Represents and activates semantic nodes.\n   - Attention Mechanism: Manages active nodes to simulate working memory limits.\n   - Output Layer: Generates disambiguated word senses.\n\n3.

It's important to consider how these systems might influence human behavior and decision-making.\n\nb) Societal impacts of advanced semantic processing AI include improved natural language understanding in applications like virtual assistants, translation services, and educational tools.

These pathways converge in a central processing unit that maps the source domain to the target domain using learned patterns.\n   c) The attention bottleneck is implemented through a gating mechanism that limits the number of features processed at once. This is achieved using attention layers that prioritize inputs based on their relevance and importance, similar to human selective attention.\n   d) The system's structure includes an input layer for language data, followed by attention layers, dual-pathway hidden layers for metaphor processing, and an output layer for generating interpretations. The attention layers filter and prioritize inputs, the dual-pathway layers extract and map features, and the output layer synthesizes the final interpretation.\n\n3. Application to Language Task:\n   a) The AI system approaches figurative language interpretation by first identifying potential metaphors in the input text. It then activates the relevant semantic networks for both the source and target domains.\n   b) The system processes input by parsing the text to detect metaphorical expressions, applying the attention mechanism to prioritize relevant features, mapping the source features to the target, and generating an interpretation based on the combined features.\n   c) The attention bottleneck affects performance by ensuring that only the most relevant features are processed, preventing overload and enhancing efficiency. It allows the system to focus on key elements of the metaphor, leading to more accurate and meaningful interpretations.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Unlike traditional NLP approaches, which rely heavily on syntactic parsing and statistical models, the neuro-semantic AI system leverages deep neural networks that mimic human semantic processing. This allows for more nuanced and context-aware interpretations of figurative language.\n   b) Advantages include improved handling of abstract concepts and better generalization across different contexts. Limitations may include the complexity of training and the need for extensive data to model human-like semantic networks accurately.\n   c) An experiment could involve comparing the system's metaphor interpretation accuracy against human performance and traditional NLP models. Participants would evaluate the quality of interpretations, and quantitative metrics like precision and recall would be used for comparison.\n\n5. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n   a) Ethical considerations include the potential for AI systems to reinforce biases present in training data, the need for transparency in decision-making processes, and the importance of ensuring user privacy and data security.\n   b) Advanced semantic processing AI systems could revolutionize fields like education, healthcare, and communication by providing more intuitive and human-like interactions. However, they could also lead to job displacement and increased surveillance if not managed responsibly.\n   c) Guidelines for responsible development include rigorous testing for bias, ensuring transparency and explainability, prioritizing user consent and privacy, and promoting societal benefits while mitigating potential harms.",
            "Answer: \n1. Neurolinguistic Foundation:\n   a) Semantic networks in the human brain are underpinned by the interconnectedness of neurons that activate in patterns corresponding to the meanings of words and concepts. These networks are formed through experiences and linguistic exposure, leading to the development of associative links between related concepts. Key brain regions involved include the left inferior frontal gyrus, which is crucial for semantic retrieval and integration, and the temporal lobes, which store semantic knowledge.\n   \n   b) Metaphor comprehension involves the activation of both the literal and figurative meanings of words. This process is mediated by the right hemisphere's involvement in abstract thinking and the integration of context. The anterior temporal lobe plays a crucial role in mapping metaphorical meanings onto known concepts, while the prefrontal cortex helps in resolving ambiguities and selecting the appropriate interpretation based on context.\n   \n   c) The attention bottleneck refers to the brain's limited capacity to process multiple stimuli simultaneously. In semantic processing, this constraint means that only a subset of potential meanings and associations can be actively considered at any given time. This limitation requires prioritization and selection mechanisms, often influenced by context and relevance, to manage cognitive load effectively.\n\n2. AI System Architecture:\n   a) The AI architecture for modeling semantic networks is inspired by neural networks, specifically designed to reflect the associative and hierarchical nature of human semantic memory. The system includes layers for semantic storage, retrieval, and integration, mimicking the brain's distributed processing.\n\n   b) Metaphor comprehension in the AI system is achieved through a dual-pathway model: one pathway processes literal meanings using context-free semantic embeddings, while the other pathway handles figurative meanings by leveraging contextual embeddings and metaphorical mappings stored in a specialized metaphor knowledge base.\n\n   c) The attention bottleneck is implemented using an attention mechanism that limits the number of semantic associations considered at each processing step. This mechanism prioritizes associations based on their contextual relevance and the system's learned importance weights, ensuring efficient processing under cognitive constraints.\n\n   d) The system's structure includes:\n      - Input layer for tokenized text.\n      - Embedding layer for semantic representation.\n      - Dual-pathway processing units for literal and figurative meanings.\n      - Attention mechanism to handle cognitive load.\n      - Integration layer to combine outputs from both pathways.\n      - Output layer for generating interpretations.\n   \n3. Application to Language Task:\n   a) For figurative language interpretation, the system first identifies potential metaphors using contextual clues and known metaphorical patterns. It then processes the literal and figurative meanings through its dual pathways and selects the most contextually appropriate interpretation.\n\n   b) Step-by-step process:\n      1. Input text is tokenized and passed through the embedding layer.\n      2. Literal meanings are processed through the first pathway.\n      3. Figurative meanings are processed through the second pathway.\n      4. The attention mechanism prioritizes relevant associations.\n      5. Outputs from both pathways are integrated.\n      6. The final interpretation is generated and outputted.\n\n   c) The attention bottleneck ensures that only the most relevant associations are considered, reducing cognitive load and focusing on the most contextually appropriate interpretations. This mechanism improves efficiency and accuracy, particularly in complex figurative language tasks.\n\n4. Comparative Analysis:\n   a) Traditional NLP approaches often rely on statistical methods and pre-trained language models that may not account for the nuanced cognitive processes involved in metaphor comprehension. In contrast, the neuro-semantic AI system explicitly models these processes, potentially leading to more accurate and human-like interpretations.\n\n   b) Advantages of the neuro-semantic system include more nuanced understanding and context-sensitive interpretations. However, limitations may arise from the complexity of accurately modeling human cognitive processes and potential computational inefficiencies.\n\n   c) An experiment could involve comparing the system's performance on a figurative language interpretation task with human participants and traditional NLP models. Metrics would include accuracy, processing time, and qualitative assessments of interpretation quality.\n\n5. Ethical and Societal Implications:\n   a) Ethical considerations include ensuring transparency in how the system makes decisions, avoiding biases in training data, and respecting user privacy. Developers must be cautious of over-reliance on AI systems that mimic human cognition, as this could lead to unintended consequences.\n\n   b) Advanced semantic processing AI systems could significantly impact communication, education, and mental health fields by providing tools for better understanding and generating human-like language. However, these systems also risk exacerbating digital divides and misinformation.\n\n   c) Guidelines for responsible development should include rigorous testing for biases and unintended effects, ensuring transparency and explainability, and establishing ethical standards for AI's use in sensitive applications. Continuous monitoring and updating based on societal feedback are also crucial."
