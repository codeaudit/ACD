Apply a small amount of glue to the base of one of the triangular cardboard pieces and attach it to the center square, making sure that it is aligned with the edges of the square. 4. Repeat step 3 for the remaining three triangular cardboard pieces, attaching them to the center square one at a time, making sure that they are aligned with the edges of the square and that the base of each triangle is attached to the center square. 5. Once all four triangular cardboard pieces are attached, the pyramid shape should start to take form. 6. Continue to apply glue to the edges of the triangular cardboard pieces as needed to secure them to the center square and to each other. 7. Make any necessary adjustments to the pyramid to ensure that it is stable and even. 8. Allow the glue to dry completely before handling the pyramid."

            "content": "Given the context and the capabilities of current LLMs, it's important to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Spatial Reasoning and Physical Intuition**: LLMs typically struggle with tasks requiring advanced spatial reasoning and physical intuition since these capabilities are not directly derived from text-based data. However, they can generate logically ordered steps based on textual descriptions of spatial relationships.\n\n2. **Language Understanding**: LLMs are proficient at generating detailed and logically ordered descriptions based on specific instructions. They can follow a structured format and provide step-by-step instructions when given clear prompts.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated by another LLM (via `eval_with_llm_judge`), which checks for clarity, logical order, and adherence to the specified format. While LLMs can evaluate text for coherence and logical structure, their ability to accurately judge physical construction tasks may be limited.\n\nGiven these considerations, the LLM agent's success at generating coherent and logically ordered steps for constructing a geometric shape is not particularly surprising. Although the task is estimated as difficult for humans, the difficulty primarily stems from spatial reasoning and physical intuition, which are partly bypassed by focusing on textual descriptions.\n\n**Decision: No**"
