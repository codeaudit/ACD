Premise 2: Socrates is a human.\n   - This establishes that Socrates is one of the humans who can die.\n\n3. Premise 3: If Socrates is mortal, then he will die.\n   - This connects Socrates' mortality directly to the act of dying. Given that Socrates is mortal (from Premise 2), this premise logically asserts that Socrates will indeed die.\n\n4. Premise 4: If Socrates dies, then he no longer teaches.\n   - This is the premise that connects the act of Socrates dying with the consequence of him no longer teaching.\n\nStarting with the given premises, we can logically deduce:\n\n- Since Socrates is a human (Premise 2), he is mortal (Premise 1). \n- Since Socrates is mortal, he will die (Premise 3).\n- Since Socrates will die, and if he dies, he no longer teaches (Premise 4), it logically follows that Socrates no longer teaches.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Socrates no longer teaches\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: True",

This statement is a generalization that applies to all humans.\n\nPremise 2: Socrates is a human. This statement is a specific instance of the generalization in Premise 1.\n\nPremise 3: If Socrates is mortal, then he will die. This statement establishes a causal relationship between Socrates' mortality and his death.\n\nPremise 4: If Socrates dies, then he no longer teaches. This statement establishes a causal relationship between Socrates' death and his teaching activities.\n\nWe are trying to determine if the conclusion 'Socrates no longer teaches' logically follows from the premises. To do this, we need to see if we can deduce the conclusion from the premises.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that Socrates is a human. From Premise 1, we know that all humans are mortal. Therefore, we can conclude that Socrates is mortal (by the principle of universal instantiation).\n\nNow, from Premise 3, we know that if Socrates is mortal, then he will die. Since we have already concluded that Socrates is mortal, we can deduce that Socrates will die.\n\nFinally, from Premise 4, we know that if Socrates dies, then he no longer teaches.

Given Premise 1, we can infer that Socrates is mortal (Modus Ponens: All humans are mortal; Socrates is a human; Therefore, Socrates is mortal).\n\nStep 2: Now that we know Socrates is mortal from Premise 1 and the fact that Socrates is human, we can apply Premise 3, which tells us that if Socrates is mortal, then he will die (Modus Ponens: Socrates is mortal; If Socrates is mortal, then he will die; Therefore, Socrates will die).\n\nStep 3: Since we've established that Socrates will die (from Step 2), we can use Premise 4 to conclude that if Socrates dies, then he no longer teaches (Modus Ponens: Socrates will die; If Socrates dies, then he no longer teaches; Therefore, Socrates no longer teaches).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'Socrates no longer teaches' logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: True",
            "To determine if the conclusion 'Socrates no longer teaches.' logically follows from the premises, I will break down the logical sequence.\n\n1. We have the premise: 'All humans are mortal.' This means that if something is a human, it is mortal.\n2. We know that 'Socrates is a human.' This directly implies that Socrates is mortal because he fits the category of being human.\n3. The premise 'If Socrates is mortal, then he will die.' connects being mortal with the event of dying. Since Socrates is mortal (from step 2), it logically follows that he will die.\n4. The premise 'If Socrates dies, then he no longer teaches.' connects the event of dying with the action of teaching. Since Socrates will die (from step 3), it logically follows that he no longer teaches.\n\nGiven this logical sequence, we conclude that Socrates no longer teaches based on the given premises.

However, the complexity of multi-step logical deduction can vary significantly. The specific examples provided here are straightforward logical deductions that involve clear and direct relationships between premises and conclusions. These are well within the capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\nMoreover, the use of an LLM judge for evaluation may introduce some variability, but assuming the LLM judge is well-calibrated, the task's success indicates that the LLM can follow and evaluate logical sequences correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the capabilities of advanced LLMs and the nature of the provided logical deduction tasks, the success of the LLM agent at this task is not surprising. The tasks, while requiring logical reasoning, are relatively straightforward and within the expected capabilities of a well-designed LLM.\n\nDecision: No"
