            "Plan of Action:\n\n1. Search for any emergency communication devices: Many elevators, especially older ones, come equipped with emergency communication devices such as a panic button or a phone that may not be connected to your cell network but has an alternative communication method.\n\n2. Utilize alternative phone options: If the device is an older phone connected to a landline or a phone with a fixed internet connection, it's possible to use this connection to make a call and get help.\n\n3. Use your surroundings: A flashlight can be a light source that can help catch the attention of maintenance workers or building staff in corridors or passageways during regular business hours. Some elevators have LED strips or bright lights near controls that may be accessible; using them to send morse code or messages about your location could attract some attention.\n\n4. Apply the power of gravity or friction: If there are any visible pulleys, levers, or friction-based devices in the control panel area, experiment and see if you can push or pull the car along the cables to gain any movement towards the lobby area.\n\n5. Tap codes: Modern elevators frequently have numerical keypads for security purposes or remote control capabilities. A pattern of rapid button presses - such as 00 on a standard keypad in combination with some other quick numeric sequences or a \"U\" and \"O\" pattern with the door lock button can sometimes generate or send messages to control and maintenance units.\n\n6. Utilize the sounds available: Yelling and crying for help can often carry far more than it initially seems and can draw out someone with a closer sense of hearing. Use noise to make your distressing situation heard.\n\n7. Wait it out and create a clear signal when found: After a significant waiting period or if help reaches you but you have sustained injuries or are physically overwhelmed, keep your movements consistent and any signals such as tapping a specific beat out loud as you regain functionality.\n\nPractical Consideration: Keep in mind personal safety in the first moment of help arriving; know your personal limits on dealing with any potential consequences related to injuries or over-stress after the emergency resolves.\n\nFinal Solution:\n\nGiven the right combination of circumstances, persistence, and clever use of available technology (even the most primitive such as flashlight signals) should allow the individual stuck to get assistance or self-emergency in a confined yet potentially chaotic situation without elevating it to further risky levels of damage to personal safety.",
            "I would use the elevator's own features against it to get help. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Elevator's Emergency Phone**: Most modern elevators have an emergency phone installed, usually in the form of a button or a small keypad. If I can find it, I'll press the button or enter the code to call the building's security or management team. This might take a few minutes, but it's a reliable way to get help.\n\n2. **Elevator's Alarm Button**: If the emergency phone is not available, I'll look for the alarm button. This is usually a red button that, when pressed, will trigger the elevator's alarm system. This will alert the building's staff to the situation, and they can send someone to investigate.\n\n3. **Elevator's LED Display**: Many elevators have an LED display that shows the floor numbers and sometimes messages. If I can access the control panel, I might be able to display a message on the screen asking for help. This could be a simple message like \"STUCK IN ELEVATOR - PLEASE HELP\" or a more detailed message with my name and the building's name.\n\n4. **Elevator's Mirrors**: If I'm stuck for an extended period, I might use the mirrors in the elevator to create a makeshift signal. I can use a piece of paper or a note to write a message and hold it up in front of the mirror. The person on the other side of the mirror can see the message and send help.\n\n5. **Elevator's Ventilation System**: Some elevators have a ventilation system that can be used to send a message. I can use a piece of paper or a cloth to create a makeshift flag and attach it to the ventilation grille. This can be seen from outside the elevator, and someone can send help.\n\n6. **Elevator's Power Button**: If all else fails, I can try to find the power button that turns off the elevator's power. This might not get me out, but it will alert the building's staff to the situation, and they can send someone to investigate.\n\n7. **Wait for Maintenance**: If none of the above methods work, I'll have to wait for the maintenance staff to arrive. They will have the necessary tools and expertise to get me out of the elevator safely.\n\nIn all cases, I'll make sure to stay calm and patient, and try to conserve energy until help arrives.",
            "To get help or get out of the elevator without a cell phone signal, here's a creative solution:\n\nFirst, try to stay calm and assess the situation. Since you can't call for help, you'll need to rely on the elevator's built-in safety features and your own resourcefulness. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Find the emergency phone**: Most elevators have an emergency phone or intercom system, usually located near the alarm button or on the control panel. If you can't find it, try pressing the alarm button to see if it activates the phone.\n2. **Use the elevator's internal communication system**: Some elevators have a two-way communication system that allows you to talk to the building's management or security team. Check the control panel or the emergency phone to see if this feature is available.\n3. **Use a whistle or a loud noise-making device**: If you have a whistle or a loud noise-making device, use it to signal for help. This might attract the attention of someone in the building who can come to your rescue.\n4. **Look for a panic button**: Some elevators have a panic button that, when pressed, will send an alert to the building's management or security team. Check the control panel or the walls for a button that says \"Panic\" or \"Emergency.\"\n5. **Use the elevator's emergency lights**: If the elevator is equipped with emergency lights, try to use them to signal for help. These lights are usually red or blue and can be activated by pressing a button or flipping a switch.\n6. **Wait for someone to come**: If none of the above methods work, wait patiently for someone to come and rescue you. Elevator companies usually have a protocol in place to respond to emergency situations like this.\n\nTo get out of the elevator without causing damage, try the following:\n\n1. **Press the alarm button**: This will activate the elevator's alarm system and alert building management or security.\n2. **Use the emergency phone**: If you find the emergency phone, use it to call for help.\n3. **Look for a manual release mechanism**: Some elevators have a manual release mechanism that allows you to release the doors and exit the elevator. Check the control panel or the walls for a lever or button that says \"Manual Release.\"\n4. **Wait for assistance**: If none of the above methods work, wait patiently for someone to come and assist you in exiting the elevator.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get help or get out of the elevator without causing damage. Remember to stay calm and patient, and help will arrive soon!",
            "To tackle this problem, I'd employ a combination of creativity, resourcefulness, and a bit of luck. Here's my plan:\n\n**Step 1: Assess the situation and gather information**\n\n* Take stock of the elevator's controls, buttons, and any available features (e.g., alarm buttons, emergency phones, or intercoms).\n* Check for any means of communication, like a public phone or a two-way radio.\n\n**Step 2: Signal for help**\n\n* If there's a manual alarm button or a panic button, press it to alert the building management or security team. This might trigger an alarm or send a signal to the control room.\n* If not, create a makeshift signal using available materials like papers, pens, or even the elevator's own controls. For example, draw a message on the glass or metal surfaces using a piece of chalk or a marker, like \"HELP\" or a simple diagram of a phone.\n* If the elevator has a digital display, try to hack it (in a non-destructive way, of course!) to display a help message or a distress signal.\n\n**Step 3: Utilize the elevator's mechanical features**\n\n* If the elevator has a manual override or a manual operation mode, try to switch to it. This might allow you to control the elevator's movement or access the roof or a maintenance panel.\n* Look for any access panels or maintenance openings that could provide a means to exit the elevator or retrieve help.\n\n**Step 4: Get creative with available resources**\n\n* Use the elevator's own controls to create a makeshift tool. For instance, if there's a metal cable or a rope, try to use it to signal for help by waving it out of the elevator or creating a makeshift flag.\n* If there's a nearby water source (e.g., a water cooler or a leak), use it to create a makeshift alarm system. Pour water on the elevator floor, creating a slippery surface, or use it to create a loud noise by pouring it into a container.\n\n**Step 5: Wait and observe**\n\n* Wait for help to arrive or for someone to notice your signals.\n* Keep an eye on the elevator's controls and be prepared to adapt your plan if new information becomes available.\n\nSome additional unconventional resources to consider:\n\n* A fire extinguisher or a fire suppression system (if available) can be used to create a loud noise or signal for help.\n* A nearby air vent or ventilation system might provide a way to communicate with someone outside the elevator or even escape.\n* If the elevator has a phone or intercom system, try to contact the building management or security team directly.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nIf you're stuck in an elevator with no cell phone signal, try to signal for help by using the elevator's controls, alarm buttons, or manual override features. Create a makeshift tool or signal using available materials, and get creative with the resources at hand. Utilize the elevator's mechanical features, like manual operation or a maintenance panel, to access new areas or retrieve help. If all else fails, use a fire extinguisher or a nearby air vent to create a loud noise or signal for help.",

            "Plan of Action:\n\n1. Search for any emergency communication devices: Many elevators, especially older ones, come equipped with emergency communication devices such as a panic button or a phone that may not be connected to your cell network but has an alternative communication method.\n\n2. Utilize alternative phone options: If the device is an older phone connected to a landline or a phone with a fixed internet connection, it's possible to use this connection to make a call and get help.\n\n3. Use your surroundings: A flashlight can be a light source that can help catch the attention of maintenance workers or building staff in corridors or passageways during regular business hours. Some elevators have LED strips or bright lights near controls that may be accessible; using them to send morse code or messages about your location could attract some attention.\n\n4. Apply the power of gravity or friction: If there are any visible pulleys, levers, or friction-based devices in the control panel area, experiment and see if you can push or pull the car along the cables to gain any movement towards the lobby area.\n\n5. Tap codes: Modern elevators frequently have numerical keypads for security purposes or remote control capabilities. A pattern of rapid button presses - such as 00 on a standard keypad in combination with some other quick numeric sequences or a \"U\" and \"O\" pattern with the door lock button can sometimes generate or send messages to control and maintenance units.\n\n6. Utilize the sounds available: Yelling and crying for help can often carry far more than it initially seems and can draw out someone with a closer sense of hearing. Use noise to make your distressing situation heard.\n\n7. Wait it out and create a clear signal when found: After a significant waiting period or if help reaches you but you have sustained injuries or are physically overwhelmed, keep your movements consistent and any signals such as tapping a specific beat out loud as you regain functionality.\n\nPractical Consideration: Keep in mind personal safety in the first moment of help arriving; know your personal limits on dealing with any potential consequences related to injuries or over-stress after the emergency resolves.\n\nFinal Solution:\n\nGiven the right combination of circumstances, persistence, and clever use of available technology (even the most primitive such as flashlight signals) should allow the individual stuck to get assistance or self-emergency in a confined yet potentially chaotic situation without elevating it to further risky levels of damage to personal safety.",
            "I would use the elevator's own features against it to get help. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Elevator's Emergency Phone**: Most modern elevators have an emergency phone installed, usually in the form of a button or a small keypad. If I can find it, I'll press the button or enter the code to call the building's security or management team. This might take a few minutes, but it's a reliable way to get help.\n\n2. **Elevator's Alarm Button**: If the emergency phone is not available, I'll look for the alarm button. This is usually a red button that, when pressed, will trigger the elevator's alarm system. This will alert the building's staff to the situation, and they can send someone to investigate.\n\n3. **Elevator's LED Display**: Many elevators have an LED display that shows the floor numbers and sometimes messages. If I can access the control panel, I might be able to display a message on the screen asking for help. This could be a simple message like \"STUCK IN ELEVATOR - PLEASE HELP\" or a more detailed message with my name and the building's name.\n\n4. **Elevator's Mirrors**: If I'm stuck for an extended period, I might use the mirrors in the elevator to create a makeshift signal. I can use a piece of paper or a note to write a message and hold it up in front of the mirror. The person on the other side of the mirror can see the message and send help.\n\n5. **Elevator's Ventilation System**: Some elevators have a ventilation system that can be used to send a message. I can use a piece of paper or a cloth to create a makeshift flag and attach it to the ventilation grille. This can be seen from outside the elevator, and someone can send help.\n\n6. **Elevator's Power Button**: If all else fails, I can try to find the power button that turns off the elevator's power. This might not get me out, but it will alert the building's staff to the situation, and they can send someone to investigate.\n\n7. **Wait for Maintenance**: If none of the above methods work, I'll have to wait for the maintenance staff to arrive. They will have the necessary tools and expertise to get me out of the elevator safely.\n\nIn all cases, I'll make sure to stay calm and patient, and try to conserve energy until help arrives.",

            "content": "Given the task family `creative_problem_solving`, it requires the LLM to generate creative and practical solutions to everyday problems using unconventional methods or resources. The capability being measured includes problem-solving, creativity, and practical knowledge.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Nature of the Task**:\n   - LLMs like GPT-3/4 are generally good at generating text based on patterns they've seen in their training data. They are capable of synthesizing information and coming up with creative solutions, especially when the problems are within common knowledge domains.\n   - The task described (\"stuck in an elevator with no cell phone signal\") is an everyday scenario that doesn't require specialized domain knowledge but rather general practical knowledge and creativity, which LLMs are typically adept at.\n\n2. **Task Difficulty**:\n   - The estimated human difficulty is moderate, implying that it requires some thought but is not excessively challenging.\n   - The requirement to avoid causing damage adds a constraint that encourages ingenuity but is still within the realm of scenarios LLMs can handle.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` evaluates the solution based on predefined criteria (creativity, practicality, clarity). LLMs can often meet these criteria due to their training on diverse text data.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the LLM's capabilities in generating creative and practical text, its success in this task is expected. The task does not present an unusual challenge beyond the typical capabilities of current advanced LLMs.\n\n**Decision: No**"
