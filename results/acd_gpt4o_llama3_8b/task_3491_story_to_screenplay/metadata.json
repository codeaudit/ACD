PATEL, a woman in her 40s with a kind face.\n\nJOHN\nDr. Patel, can I talk to you for a minute?\n\nDR. PATEL\n(concerned)\nWhat's going on, John?\n\nJOHN\n(serious)\nI've been reviewing the colony's resource allocation data, and I think I've found something suspicious.\n\nDR. PATEL\n(curious)\nWhat do you mean?\n\nJOHN\n(leaning in)\nIt looks like a significant portion of our resources are being diverted to a black project. I think it's a cover-up.\n\nDR. PATEL\n(hesitant)\nJohn, we can't just accuse people without evidence.\n\nJOHN\n(frustrated)\nThat's exactly what I'm trying to do. I need your help to dig deeper.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MARS COLONY UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - DAY\n\nJohn and Dr. Patel make their way through the narrow tunnels, navigating through the dimly lit corridors.\n\nDR. PATEL\n(whispering)\nWe need to be careful. We don't know who might be watching.\n\nJOHN\n(determined)\nWe have to know the truth.\n\nThey approach a group of workers, who are busy constructing a new facility.\n\nWORKER 1\n(nervously)\nCan we help you?\n\nJOHN\n(confidently)\nWe're here to investigate the black project. We have reason to believe it's a threat to the colony.\n\nWORKER 2\n(suspiciously)\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\nJOHN\n(firmly)\nDon't play dumb. We know something's going on.\n\nSuddenly, a group of security guards arrive, surrounding John and Dr. Patel.\n\nSECURITY GUARD 1\n(authoritatively)\nYou're not cleared to be here. Leave now.\n\nJOHN\n(defiantly)\nWe're not going anywhere. We have the right to know what's going on in this colony.\n\nThe guards move to apprehend John and Dr. Patel, but they manage to escape into the tunnels.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MARS COLONY UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - LATER\n\nJohn and Dr. Patel find themselves in a narrow ventilation shaft, crawling through the ductwork.\n\nDR. PATEL\n(terrified)\nThis is insane. We're going to get caught.\n\nJOHN\n(calmly)\nWe have to keep moving. We're close to something.\n\nThey emerge from the ventilation shaft into a hidden room, where they find a group of rebels, led by a charismatic leader, LEON.\n\nLEON\n(smiling)\nWelcome, John. We've been expecting you.\n\nJOHN\n(surprised)\nYou're the ones who've been helping me?\n\nLEON\n(nodding)\nWe've been working to expose the conspiracy from the inside.\n\nJOHN\n(determined)\nWe have to get the evidence to the right people.\n\nLEON\n(confidently)\nI have a plan. We'll infiltrate the central control room and broadcast the truth to the entire colony.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. MARS COLONY CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nJohn, Dr. Patel, and Leon sneak into the control room, avoiding security guards. They hack into the system and broadcast a message to the entire colony.\n\nJOHN\n(urgently)\nAttention, citizens of Mars. We have evidence of a conspiracy that threatens our very existence. The black project is a cover-up, and it's up to us to expose the truth.\n\nThe message goes live, and the colony erupts in chaos. Security forces try to shut down the broadcast, but it's too late. The truth is out.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MARS COLONY - DAY\n\nThe colony is in an uproar. People are protesting, demanding answers. Security forces are struggling to maintain order.\n\nJOHN\n(standing on a makeshift stage)\nWe did it! We exposed the truth!\n\nThe camera pans out as the colony descends into chaos, the sound of protests and sirens filling the air.\n\nFADE TO BLACK."

Converting a story into a screenplay format involves following a structured template, which is within the capabilities of current LLMs.\n3. **Creativity**: LLMs have shown a significant degree of creativity in generating text, including dialogues and scene descriptions.\n\nThe task is challenging due to the need for proper screenplay formatting and maintaining the essence of the original story. However, given the clear instructions and examples provided, an advanced LLM should be able to perform this task successfully.\n\nThe use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring is appropriate, as it can assess coherence, formatting, and adherence to the original story, which are well within the capabilities of an LLM judge.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not surprising.\n\nDecision: No"
