            "To convert the active voice sentence into a passive voice sentence, I will identify the subject (The committee) and the action (will review). Then, I will rearrange the sentence so that the action becomes the subject, and the original subject becomes the object.\n\nThe action is \"will review\", and the subject is \"The committee\". To convert the sentence into passive voice, I will change the sentence to: \"The proposal will be reviewed by the committee next week.\"\n\nHowever, the original sentence implies that the committee is performing the action, so it's more suitable to use the by-phrase to specify the doer of the action. Therefore, the most natural passive voice sentence would be: \"The proposal will be reviewed next week by the committee.\"\n\nAnswer: The proposal will be reviewed next week by the committee."
