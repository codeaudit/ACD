This means that 1 and 3 must be adjacent, with 1 on the left side.\n2. 2 cannot be placed next to 4. This constraint doesn't directly impact the placement of 1 and 3, but it means 2 and 4 must be separated by at least one element.\n3. 5 must be placed immediately after 2 or 3. This constraint suggests that 5 can only be placed after either 2 or 3, so we should consider these as a pair for now.\n4. 3 must be placed in the middle. This means that 3 should be placed in the second or third position.\n\nConsidering all these constraints, let's try to create a valid solution. \n\nSince 3 must be in the middle, let's place it in the second position. Now we have: _, 3, _. We need to place 1 before 3, so let's place 1 in the first position: 1, 3, _. Now we need to place 5 after 3, but since 5 must be immediately after 2 or 3, and 2 can't be next to 4, we need to consider the placement of 2 and 4 carefully.\n\nIf we place 2 after 3, we get: 1, 3, 2, _. This doesn't work because 5 must be immediately after 2 or 3, but we can't place 5 after 3 in this arrangement.\n\nIf we place 2 before 3, we get: 1, 2, 3, _. Now we can place 5 after 3, but we still need to place 4. We can't place 4 next to 2, so let's place 4 after 5: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the constraints: 1 is before 3, 2 is not next to 4, 5 is immediately after 2 or 3, and 3 is in the middle.\n\nAnswer: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4"
