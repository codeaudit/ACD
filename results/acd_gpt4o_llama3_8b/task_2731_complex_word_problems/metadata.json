We are given two pieces of information: \n1) The total number of heads is 50, which can be expressed as: C + W = 50.\n2) The total number of legs is 140, which can be expressed as: 2C + 4W = 140 (chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each).\n\nWe can start by solving the first equation for W: W = 50 - C.\n\nNow, substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation: 2C + 4(50 - C) = 140\n\nSimplify the equation: 2C + 200 - 4C = 140\nCombine like terms: -2C + 200 = 140\nSubtract 200 from both sides: -2C = -60\nDivide both sides by -2: C = 30\n\nNow that we know the number of chickens is 30, we can find the number of cows by substituting the value of C into the first equation: W = 50 - C = 50 - 30 = 20\n\nTherefore, the farmer has 30 chickens and 20 cows.",
            "Solution: Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. Since each chicken has 1 head and each cow has 1 head, the total number of heads can be represented as C + W = 50. Additionally, since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, the total number of legs can be represented as 2C + 4W = 140. We now have a system of linear equations:\n\nC + W = 50\n2C + 4W = 140\n\nTo solve this system, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of C equal:\n\n2C + 2W = 100\n\nNow, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C:\n\n(2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 140 - 100\n2W = 40\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nW = 20\n\nNow that we know W, we can substitute this value into the first equation to solve for C:\n\nC + W = 50\nC + 20 = 50\nC = 30\n\nTherefore, the farmer has 30 chickens and 20 cows.",
            "Solution: Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as W. We are given two pieces of information: the total number of heads (C + W = 50) and the total number of legs (2C + 4W = 140). We can solve this system of linear equations by first multiplying the first equation by 2 to get 2C + 2W = 100. Then, we can subtract this equation from the second equation to eliminate C: (2C + 4W) - (2C + 2W) = 140 - 100, which simplifies to 2W = 40. Dividing both sides by 2, we get W = 20. Now that we have the number of cows, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the number of chickens: C + 20 = 50, so C = 30. Therefore, the farmer has 30 chickens and 20 cows.",

The total number of legs is 140, which means 2C + 4B = 140.\n\nNow, let's simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nC + 2B = 70\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nC + B = 50\nC + 2B = 70\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\nB = 20\n\nNow that we know the number of cows, we can substitute B = 20 into the first equation to find the number of chickens:\n\nC + 20 = 50\nC = 30\n\nTherefore, the farmer has 30 chickens and 20 cows."
