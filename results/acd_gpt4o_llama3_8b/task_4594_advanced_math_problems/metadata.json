            "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write down the characteristic equation of the matrix A.\n2. Solve the characteristic equation to find the eigenvalues.\n3. Find the corresponding eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.\n\nThe characteristic equation of a matrix A is given by:\n\n|A - \u03bbI| = 0\n\nwhere \u03bb is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.\n\nFor matrix A = [[2, 1], [1, 2]], the characteristic equation is:\n\n|[[2, 1], [1, 2]] - \u03bb[[1, 0], [0, 1]]| = 0\n|[2-\u03bb, 1], [1, 2-\u03bb]| = 0\n\nExpanding the determinant, we get:\n\n(2-\u03bb)^2 - 1 = 0\n4 - 4\u03bb + \u03bb^2 - 1 = 0\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \u03bb, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\n\u03bb = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -4, and c = 3. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\n\u03bb = (4 \u00b1 \u221a((-4)^2 - 4*1*3)) / 2*1\n\u03bb = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 12)) / 2\n\u03bb = (4 \u00b1 \u221a4) / 2\n\u03bb = (4 \u00b1 2) / 2\n\nSimplifying, we get two possible values for \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = (4 + 2) / 2 = 3\n\u03bb = (4 - 2) / 2 = 1\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are \u03bb = 3 and \u03bb = 1.\n\nTo find the corresponding eigenvectors, we need to solve the equation (A - \u03bbI)v = 0 for each eigenvalue.\n\nFor \u03bb = 3, we have:\n\n[[2, 1], [1, 2]] - 3[[1, 0], [0, 1]] = [[-1, 1], [1, -1]]\n[[-1, 1], [1, -1]]v = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-1v1 + v2 = 0\nv1 - v2 = 0\n\nThis equation has a non-trivial solution, and the corresponding eigenvector is:\n\nv = [1, 1]\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, we have:\n\n[[2, 1], [1, 2]] - 1[[1, 0], [0, 1]] = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]\n[[1, 1], [1, 1]]v = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nv1 + v2 = 0\nv1 + v2 = 0\n\nThis equation has a non-trivial solution, and the corresponding eigenvector is:\n\nv = [-1, 1]\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are \u03bb = 3 and \u03bb = 1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are v = [1, 1] and v = [-1, 1].\n\nThe final answer is:\n\nAnswer: Solution: [\u03bb = 3, \u03bb = 1, v = [1, 1], v = [-1, 1]]\nExplanation: The characteristic equation of the matrix A is \u03bb^2 - 4\u03bb + 3 = 0, which has solutions \u03bb = 3 and \u03bb = 1. The corresponding eigenvectors are v = [1, 1] for \u03bb = 3 and v = [-1, 1] for \u03bb = 1."
