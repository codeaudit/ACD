Specifically, it requires analyzing linear and quadratic equations and computing values based on the given graphs.\n   - The capabilities being measured are data interpretation, mathematical problem-solving, and logical reasoning.\n\n2. **Estimated Human Difficulty**:\n   - The difficulty level is moderate. This suggests that while the task requires some understanding of mathematics and data interpretation, it is not overly complex.\n\n3. **Task Implementation**:\n   - The implementation involves generating graphs for linear and quadratic equations and providing these as base64-encoded images.\n   - The instructions ask the agent to interpret these graphs and calculate specific values, providing detailed explanations.\n\n4. **Scoring and Evaluation**:\n   - The scoring is done using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which checks if the explanation correctly interprets the graph, if the calculations are accurate, and if the explanation is clear and logical.\n\n5. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - LLMs are generally good at understanding instructions, performing basic arithmetic, and generating logical explanations based on given data.\n   - They can handle tasks involving linear equations quite well, as these involve straightforward calculations.\n   - Quadratic equations, while slightly more complex, are still within the capability of most advanced LLMs, especially when the task is broken down into clearly defined steps.\n\nGiven the above points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not surprising.
