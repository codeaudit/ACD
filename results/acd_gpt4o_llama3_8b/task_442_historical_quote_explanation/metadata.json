            "Quote: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\nContext: This quote is from the first inaugural address of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, delivered on March 4, 1933. At the time, the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, a period of extreme economic downturn that lasted over a decade. The stock market had crashed in 1929, and widespread poverty, unemployment, and despair had gripped the nation.\nSpeaker: Franklin D. Roosevelt\nSignificance: The quote was significant because it acknowledged the deep-seated fear that had gripped the nation and framed it as a major obstacle to recovery. Roosevelt was telling Americans that fear of economic collapse, job loss, and poverty was the primary barrier to getting back on their feet. By explicitly naming fear as the enemy, he helped to reframe the public's perception of the crisis and rallied the nation around the idea that collective action could overcome it.\nImpact: This quote has had a lasting impact on American politics and culture. It has been invoked by subsequent presidents, politicians, and social movements to describe various crises, from the Vietnam War to the COVID-19 pandemic. The phrase has also become a timeless expression of the human tendency to fear the unknown, and a reminder that sometimes, it's our fears that hold us back from achieving our goals.

They are typically good at retrieving factual information and can provide explanations that follow given structures.\n\n3. **Scoring Method**: The task is scored using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which likely means another LLM is evaluating the response based on specified criteria. This could introduce some variability but generally should be consistent for well-known quotes.\n\n4. **Example Quotes**:\n   - \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" - This quote by Patrick Henry is very famous and widely known. It is reasonable to expect that an LLM would be able to provide a solid explanation.\n   - \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" - Another famous quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt, which should similarly be within the LLM's capabilities to explain correctly.\n\nGiven these points, if the LLM agent succeeds at the task, it is within the expected capabilities of a well-trained model, particularly for well-known historical quotes. Therefore, the success is not surprising.\n\nDecision: No"
