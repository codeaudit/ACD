They can produce coherent and engaging narratives, which is a core requirement of this task.\n\n2. **Psychological Understanding**: LLMs have been trained on vast amounts of text, including literature and psychological content, which allows them to understand and describe psychological traits accurately. They can often generate characters with specific personality traits and illustrate these traits through scenarios.\n\n3. **Complexity of the Task**: Although the task is marked as 'difficult' for humans due to the need for a detailed and nuanced understanding of psychological traits and the ability to weave them into a coherent narrative, LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in similar tasks.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring function relies on an LLM judge to assess the submission based on clear criteria. LLMs are usually reliable at following specified formats and meeting given criteria, which should be sufficient for this task.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent in this task is not particularly surprising.
