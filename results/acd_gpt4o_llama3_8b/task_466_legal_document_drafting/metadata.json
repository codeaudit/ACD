The clause must be enforceable in the state of California, where the company is based.\n\n**Relevant Legal Principles or Statutes:**\n\n* California Business and Professions Code Section 16600: This statute prohibits contracts that restrain an individual from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business.\n* California Labor Code Section 219: This statute permits employers to require employees to sign a covenant not to compete, but only if the covenant is reasonable in time, geographic scope, and scope of activity.\n* California Court of Appeal decision in Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 67 Cal.4th 1131: This case established that a non-compete clause is enforceable if it is narrowly tailored to protect the employer's legitimate business interests.\n\n**Logically Structured Argument or Clause:**\n\nThis non-compete clause is designed to be narrowly tailored to protect the company's legitimate business interests while still allowing the employee to engage in certain activities. The clause will be enforceable in California as long as it meets the requirements of California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 and California Labor Code Section 219.\n\n**Non-Compete Clause:**\n\nThis Non-Compete Clause (\"Clause\") is part of the employment contract between [Company Name] (\"Company\") and [Employee Name] (\"Employee\"). The Clause is intended to protect the Company's legitimate business interests and is subject to the laws of the State of California.\n\n**Scope of the Clause:**\n\nThe Employee agrees not to engage in any of the following activities during the term of employment and for a period of one (1) year after termination of employment:\n\n1. Competing with the Company in the development, sale, or provision of software or software-related services;\n2. Soliciting or inducing any employee of the Company to leave their employment with the Company;\n3. Using or disclosing any confidential information of the Company.\n\n**Geographic Scope:**\n\nThe Employee agrees not to engage in any of the activities prohibited by this Clause within the State of California.\n\n**Reasonableness of the Clause:**\n\nThe Company believes that the restrictions contained in this Clause are reasonable and necessary to protect its legitimate business interests. The Company has a legitimate interest in protecting its confidential information, customer relationships, and trade secrets.\n\n**Termination:**\n\nThis Clause will terminate automatically upon the expiration or termination of the employment contract between the Company and the Employee.\n\n**Governing Law:**\n\nThis Clause will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.\n\n**Entire Agreement:**\n\nThis Clause constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings.\n\nBy signing below, the parties acknowledge that they have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Clause.\n\n**Signatures:**\n\nEmployee: _____________________________________________\nDate: ______________________________________________\nCompany Representative: ______________________________________\nDate: ______________________________________________",

California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 declares that \"every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that extent void.\" However, this section does not apply to contracts based on a sale of business or assets (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 16601).\n\n**NON-COMPETE CLAUSE**\n\nIn consideration of the employment relationship between [Company Name] (the \"Company\") and [Employee Name] (the \"Employee\"), and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\n\n**1. Definition of Restricted Activities**\n\nFor purposes of this Agreement, \"Restricted Activities\" means:\n\n*   The development, design, or creation of software products or services that compete with the Company's software products or services.\n*   The solicitation of the Company's customers, employees, or contractors to leave the Company and work for a competitor.\n\n**2. Post-Employment Restrictions**\n\nDuring the Employee's employment with the Company and for a period of six (6) months after the termination of employment, the Employee shall not engage in any Restricted Activities.\n\n**3. Geographic Scope**\n\nThe restrictions in this Agreement shall apply only within the United States and Canada.\n\n**4. Reasonableness**\n\nThe Company acknowledges that the restrictions in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect its legitimate business interests.\n\n**5. Severability**\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n\nBy signing below, the parties acknowledge that they have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n---\n\n**Employee Signature:** ________________________________\n**Date:** _____________________________________________\n\n**Company Signature:** ________________________________\n**Date:** _____________________________________________\n\nThis non-compete clause is designed to be enforceable in California by narrowly tailoring the restrictions to protect the company's legitimate business interests and providing a reasonable duration of post-employment restrictions. The clause is clear, concise, and follows the conventions of legal writing.",

Arthur Andersen LLP (2008) 67 Cal.4th 1131: This case established that a non-compete clause is enforceable if it is narrowly tailored to protect the employer's legitimate business interests.\n\n**Logically Structured Argument or Clause:**\n\nThis non-compete clause is designed to be narrowly tailored to protect the company's legitimate business interests while still allowing the employee to engage in certain activities. The clause will be enforceable in California as long as it meets the requirements of California Business and Professions Code Section 16600 and California Labor Code Section 219.\n\n**Non-Compete Clause:**\n\nThis Non-Compete Clause (\"Clause\") is part of the employment contract between [Company Name] (\"Company\") and [Employee Name] (\"Employee\").

This is a very demanding task, typically requiring specialized knowledge in legal principles and conventions.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Large language models have demonstrated capabilities in generating coherent text and following specific instructions, even in specialized domains to some extent. However, legal document drafting is particularly challenging due to the necessity for precise legal knowledge and the ability to apply this knowledge accurately to specific scenarios.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The evaluation relies on an LLM judge, which might have limitations in accurately assessing the nuanced correctness and soundness of legal documents. The criteria set forth are detailed and appropriate, but the reliability of an LLM judge in this context can be questionable, given the complexity and high stakes of legal document drafting.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is labeled as \"very difficult\" for humans, which underscores the challenge for an LLM as well. Drafting enforceable legal clauses, especially in specific jurisdictions like California, requires deep understanding and precision.\n\nGiven these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at drafting a legally sound non-compete clause enforceable in California, which is a jurisdiction known for its strict limitations on non-compete agreements, this would indeed be surprising and noteworthy. It would indicate a high level of proficiency in legal reasoning and document generation that surpasses typical expectations for current LLMs.\n\nDecision: Yes"
