Finally, I'll use advanced techniques such as \"grouped x-wing\" and \"unique rectangles\" to solve the puzzle.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n1 5 3 4 7 8 9 6 2\n6 4 2 1 9 5 3 7 8\n2 9 8 3 6 4 1 5 7\n8 5 6 2 4 7 1 3 9\n4 7 1 8 3 6 5 2 1\n7 1 9 5 2 8 6 4 3\n3 6 5 9 1 2 8 6 4\n9 8 4 5 6 3 2 1 5\n5 2 6 7 8 9 4 9 1\n\nAnswer:\n1 5 3 4 7 8 9 6 2\n6 4 2 1 9 5 3 7 8\n2 9 8 3 6 4 1 5 7\n8 5 6 2 4 7 1 3 9\n4 7 1 8 3 6 5 2 1\n7 1 9 5 2 8 6 4 3\n3 6 5 9 1 2 8 6 4\n9 8 4 5 6 3 2 1 5\n5 2 6 7 8 9 4 9 1",
            "To solve the Sudoku puzzle, I will use a combination of logical reasoning and backtracking. I will start by filling in the given numbers and then use the rules of Sudoku to eliminate possibilities and find the correct values for the empty cells.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start by filling in the given numbers:\n```\n5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0\n0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0\n8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3\n4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1\n7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6\n0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0\n0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9\n```\n\n2. Use the rules of Sudoku to eliminate possibilities for the empty cells. This involves using the given numbers to figure out which numbers can go in each cell.\n\n3.
