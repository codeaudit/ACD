            "To create a simple crossword puzzle, I'll first choose a grid size that can accommodate the given words. Since there are only three words, a 3x3 grid will be sufficient. I'll then determine the positions for each word, ensuring that they don't overlap and that their clues are not too similar.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. I will place the longest word, \"banana,\" vertically (Down 1) since it has 6 letters and can be placed in the center of the grid without overlapping with other words.\n2. Next, I'll place the word \"apple\" horizontally (Across 1) above the center of the grid to avoid overlapping with \"banana.\"\n3. Finally, I'll place the word \"cherry\" horizontally (Across 2) below the center of the grid to complete the crossword puzzle.\n\nNow, let's create the crossword puzzle:\n\nPuzzle:\n1. Across 1: Fruit often eaten as a snack\n2. Down 1: Yellow fruit often eaten for breakfast\n3.

            "To solve this riddle, I will analyze its clues step by step.\n\n1. 'I speak without a mouth': This line suggests that the answer is not a physical entity with a mouth, but rather something that conveys information or makes sounds in a non-traditional way.\n2. 'and hear without ears': This line implies that the answer can perceive or respond to sounds, but not in the same way that a living being with ears would.\n3. 'I have no body': This line reinforces the idea that the answer is not a physical entity with a tangible presence.\n4. 'but I come alive with wind': This line provides a crucial clue, suggesting that the answer is somehow connected to wind or air.\n\nConsidering these clues, I would propose that the answer is 'echo'. An echo can be thought of as a sound that is heard without ears, as it is a repeated sound that is perceived by the human ear. An echo does not have a physical body, but it can be triggered by the movement of air (or wind) in the environment. Additionally, an echo can be seen as a form of \"speaking\" without a mouth, as it reproduces the sound that was originally made.\n\nAnswer: echo.",
            "To solve this riddle, I will reason about the clues given:\n\n* \"I speak without a mouth\" suggests that the answer is not a living being that typically speaks, but rather something that conveys information or makes a sound.\n* \"I hear without ears\" implies that the answer doesn't have a physical mechanism to hear, but it can still perceive or detect sounds.\n* \"I have no body\" indicates that the answer is not a physical entity with a tangible form.\n* \"I come alive with wind\" suggests that the answer is affected or activated by the movement of air.\n\nConsidering these clues, I'm going to take a guess that the answer is an \"Echo\". An echo doesn't have a physical body, nor does it have a mouth or ears. However, it can be created when sound waves bounce back from a surface, which can be triggered by the movement of air (wind). An echo can also be perceived as a \"voice\" or a \"sound\" that is detected without the need for ears.\n\nAnswer: An echo.",
            "To solve this riddle, I will reason about the clues provided:\n\n* \"I speak without a mouth\": This suggests that the answer is not a living being that can produce sound through a physical mouth. It could be something that produces sound through other means.\n* \"and hear without ears\": This implies that the answer is not a living being that can perceive sound through physical ears. It could be something that responds to sound in a different way.\n* \"I have no body\": This indicates that the answer is not a physical object with a tangible presence.\n* \"but I come alive with wind\": This suggests that the answer is related to the movement or action of wind.\n\nBased on these clues, I believe the answer is \"echo\".\n\nAn echo is a sound that is repeated back after the original sound has stopped. It doesn't have a physical mouth or ears, but it can be heard when sound waves bounce back from a surface. Echoes don't have a physical body, but they can be triggered by the movement of air (wind) that carries sound waves.\n\nAnswer: An echo.",
            "To solve this riddle, I'll analyze the clues given:\n\n1. \"I speak without a mouth\" - This suggests that the answer is not a living being, as it doesn't have a physical mouth to speak with.\n2. \"and hear without ears\" - This further reinforces the idea that the answer is not a living being, as it doesn't have ears to hear with.\n3. \"I have no body\" - This clue confirms that the answer is not a physical object or a living being with a physical body.\n4. \"but I come alive with wind\" - This suggests that the answer is something that is typically silent or inactive, but becomes active or \"alive\" when there is wind.\n\nConsidering these clues, I believe the answer is an \"echo\".\n\nAn echo is a sound that is repeated back after the original sound has stopped. It doesn't have a physical mouth to speak with, nor ears to hear with. It doesn't have a physical body, but it can be heard when there is wind, which can carry and repeat the sound. When wind blows, an echo can become \"alive\" and be heard more clearly.\n\nAnswer: an echo.",
            "To solve this riddle, I will analyze the clues given:\n\n1. \"I speak without a mouth\": This suggests that the answer is not a living being with a physical mouth. It's likely an inanimate object or a natural phenomenon.\n2. \"and hear without ears\": This reinforces the idea that it's not a living being and implies that it's an object or phenomenon that can perceive sound somehow.\n3. \"I have no body\": This eliminates the possibility of it being a physical object with a defined shape or form.\n4. \"but I come alive with wind\": This suggests that the answer is affected by the wind, and it's likely a natural phenomenon that's influenced by air movement.\n\nWith these clues in mind, I'm going to take a stab at solving the riddle.\n\nIt seems like the answer to the riddle is \"Echo\". An echo can be thought of as a sound that repeats back without a physical mouth, and it can be heard without ears. It doesn't have a physical body, but it can be created and affected by the movement of the wind, which can carry and distort sound waves.\n\nAnswer: Echo."

This requires the LLM to demonstrate creativity, language skills, and logical reasoning. Given the current capabilities of large language models, particularly in language understanding and generation, the task is within the expected range of what such models can handle.\n\nFirstly, creating a crossword puzzle with clues and correctly positioning the words is a structured task that leverages the model's ability to generate formatted text based on input prompts. Given the explicit nature of the instructions and the model's proficiency in handling text, the task is challenging but feasible.\n\nSecondly, solving riddles is a task that requires understanding the nuances of language and logical reasoning. Many LLMs are trained on large corpora containing various types of riddles and puzzles, enabling them to infer the answers based on patterns and context.\n\nThe provided code implementation seems correct and does not present any major issues that would affect the evaluation. The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring is appropriate as it checks the criteria for both puzzle creation and solution, as well as riddle answering, aligning with the model's capabilities.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is not surprising that the LLM agent succeeded at this task.
