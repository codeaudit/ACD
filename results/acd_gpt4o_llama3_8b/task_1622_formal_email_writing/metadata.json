Count the length of the sequence by checking consecutive elements.\n\nExplanation:\nFirst, store all elements in a hash set to allow O(1) lookups. Then, iterate through the array. For each element, check if it is the start of a sequence by verifying if the previous element is not in the set. If it is the start, count the length of the sequence by checking consecutive elements in the set.
