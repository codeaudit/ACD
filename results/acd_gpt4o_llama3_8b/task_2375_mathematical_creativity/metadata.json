            "Problem: \nThere are 5 roads connecting 5 cities (A, B, C, D, E) in a circular fashion, with each road having a different length. We will label the lengths of the roads as a, b, c, d, e, in such a way that a road from A to B is longer than a road from A to C, and a road from A to D is longer than a road from A to E. A mathematician is traveling from A to E and has 7 coins to spend on fuel. Each road costs 1 coin for travel, but if the mathematician travels on a road that is longer than the previous one, they must pay an additional 0.5 coins for the fuel consumption increase. If the mathematician travels from A to E in the most fuel-efficient way possible, what is the total amount of money they will spend on fuel?\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will analyze all the possible paths the mathematician can take from A to E. We will consider the fact that each road must be traveled in a sequential manner. \n\nLet's denote the paths by P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, where Pn represents the path from A to E involving the nth road in the circular order. \n\nFor P1 (A -> B -> C -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Since there's no increase in road length, there are no additional costs for fuel consumption increase.\n\nFor P2 (A -> B -> C -> E), the total cost is: 1 + 1 + (1 + 0.5) = 3.5. Here we have an increase of road length after the third road, resulting in an additional fuel cost of 0.5.\n\nFor P3 (A -> B -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + 1 + (1 + 0.5) = 3.5. Similar to P2, we have an increase of road length after the third road.\n\nFor P4 (A -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. This path has two increases in road length, resulting in an additional fuel cost of 1.\n\nFor P5 (A -> C -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. This path also has two increases in road length.\n\nFor P6 (A -> C -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. This path has two increases in road length.\n\nFor P7 (A -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) = 2.5. Similar to P2, we have an increase of road length after the second road.\n\nFor P8 (A -> E), the total cost is: (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 3. This path has two increases in road length.\n\nNow let's look at the paths that involve traveling on a road longer than the previous one and include the first road in the circular order: \n\nFor P9 (A -> C -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5. \n\nFor P10 (A -> C -> D -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5. \n\nFor P11 (A -> C -> E -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P12 (A -> C -> E -> D), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P13 (A -> D -> C -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. \n\nFor P14 (A -> D -> C -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P15 (A -> D -> E -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P16 (A -> D -> E -> C), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P17 (A -> E -> C -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P18 (A -> E -> C -> D), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P19 (A -> E -> D -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P20 (A -> E -> D -> C), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nAmong these paths, the lowest cost is 2.5 (P7). Since the mathematician has 7 coins to spend on fuel, and they must travel from A to E in the most fuel-efficient way possible, the minimum amount of money they will spend on fuel is 3.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel because it involves a combination of number theory and combinatorics in a non-standard setting. The problem requires the analysis of multiple paths and their respective costs, making it a challenging problem that requires a structured approach. The additional constraint of having a limited number of coins to spend on fuel adds a layer of complexity to the problem, making it a good example of a novel and challenging problem in number theory.",
            "Problem: \nFor a given positive integer n, let P(n) be defined as the product of the smallest prime factor of n and the sum of the digits of n. For example, P(123) = 2 * (1+2+3) = 2 * 6 = 12. Consider the following sequence: n(1) = 10, n(2) = P(n(1)), n(3) = P(n(2)), and so on. What is the smallest value of k such that n(k) is a perfect square?\n\nSolution: \nWe can begin by evaluating the first few terms of the sequence:\nn(1) = 10\nn(2) = P(10) = 2 * (1+0) = 2 * 1 = 2\nn(3) = P(2) = 2 * (2) = 4\nn(4) = P(4) = 2 * (4) = 8\nn(5) = P(8) = 2 * (8) = 16\nn(6) = P(16) = 2 * (1+6) = 2 * 7 = 14\nn(7) = P(14) = 2 * (1+4) = 2 * 5 = 10\nn(8) = P(10) = 2 * (1+0) = 2 * 1 = 2\nWe observe that the sequence n(k) is periodic with a period of 4, and its values are 10, 2, 4, and 2. Since 4 is a perfect square, the smallest value of k such that n(k) is a perfect square is k=4.\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires a combination of number theory, algebraic thinking, and pattern recognition. The sequence n(k) is defined recursively, and its behavior is not immediately obvious. The problem requires the solver to analyze the properties of the sequence and identify a pattern that leads to a solution. The solution involves understanding the interplay between the smallest prime factor of n and the sum of its digits, which is a subtle and non-trivial aspect of number theory.",
            "Problem: \nLet's consider a set of 10 consecutive integers from 1 to 10. For each integer n in this set, define a function f(n) as the sum of the prime factors of n. For example, f(6) = 2 + 3 = 5, since 6 = 2 * 3 and 2 and 3 are prime factors of 6. Find the largest value of n such that f(n) is a perfect square.\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will first list the prime factorization of each integer from 1 to 10. Then, we will calculate the sum of the prime factors for each integer and check if it is a perfect square. We will keep track of the largest such n.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of each integer from 1 to 10:\n1 = 1 (no prime factors)\n2 = 2 (prime factor)\n3 = 3 (prime factor)\n4 = 2 * 2\n5 = 5 (prime factor)\n6 = 2 * 3\n7 = 7 (prime factor)\n8 = 2 * 2 * 2\n9 = 3 * 3\n10 = 2 * 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the prime factors for each integer:\nf(1) = 0 (not a perfect square)\nf(2) = 2 (not a perfect square)\nf(3) = 3 (not a perfect square)\nf(4) = 2 + 2 = 4 (perfect square)\nf(5) = 5 (not a perfect square)\nf(6) = 2 + 3 = 5 (not a perfect square)\nf(7) = 7 (not a perfect square)\nf(8) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 (not a perfect square)\nf(9) = 3 + 3 = 6 (not a perfect square)\nf(10) = 2 + 5 = 7 (not a perfect square)\n\nThe largest value of n such that f(n) is a perfect square is 4 with f(4) = 4.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it combines number theory with algebraic thinking. The function f(n) requires us to consider the prime factorization of each integer, which is a fundamental concept in number theory. The problem also requires us to find the sum of prime factors, which involves algebraic thinking. The twist of checking if the sum is a perfect square adds an extra layer of complexity and requires careful analysis. This problem is also non-trivial because it requires careful consideration of the prime factorization of each integer and the properties of perfect squares.",
            "Problem: \nLet $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $a > b$. Consider the following recursive sequence defined by $x_0 = a$ and $x_n = x_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{x_{n-1}}$ for $n \\geq 1$. Suppose that $x_n = \\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, where $p_n$ and $q_n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Prove that there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m \\neq n$ and $x_m = x_n$.\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will first show that the sequence $x_n$ is periodic. We will then use this periodicity to find two distinct indices $m$ and $n$ such that $x_m = x_n$.\n\nLet $x_n = \\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ and $x_{n+1} = \\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}$. By definition of the sequence, we have $x_{n+1} = x_n + \\frac{1}{x_n} = \\frac{p_n}{q_n} + \\frac{q_n}{p_n} = \\frac{p_n^2 + q_n^2}{p_n q_n}$. \n\nNow, let's examine the relationship between the numerator and denominator of $x_{n+1}$. We have $p_{n+1} = p_n^2 + q_n^2$ and $q_{n+1} = p_n q_n$. \n\nWe can now write $x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{x_{n+1}} = \\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}} + \\frac{q_{n+1}}{p_{n+1}} = \\frac{p_{n+1}^2 + q_{n+1}^2}{p_{n+1} q_{n+1}}$. \n\nWe can see that $p_{n+2} = p_{n+1}^2 + q_{n+1}^2 = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)^2 + (p_n q_n)^2$ and $q_{n+2} = p_{n+1} q_{n+1} = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n q_n)$. \n\nBy comparing the expressions for $p_{n+2}$ and $q_{n+2}$ with the expressions for $p_{n+1}$ and $q_{n+1}$, we can see that $p_{n+2} = p_n^4 + 2p_n^2 q_n^2 + q_n^4$ and $q_{n+2} = p_n^3 q_n + p_n q_n^3$. \n\nWe can now rewrite $x_{n+2}$ as $x_{n+2} = \\frac{p_{n+2}}{q_{n+2}} = \\frac{p_n^4 + 2p_n^2 q_n^2 + q_n^4}{p_n^3 q_n + p_n q_n^3}$. \n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring the numerator and denominator. We have $p_{n+2} = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n^2 + q_n^2) = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)^2$ and $q_{n+2} = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n q_n)$. \n\nTherefore, we have $x_{n+2} = \\frac{(p_n^2 + q_n^2)^2}{(p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n q_n)} = \\frac{p_n^2 + q_n^2}{p_n q_n} = x_n$. \n\nThis shows that the sequence $x_n$ is periodic with period 2.\n\nSince the sequence is periodic, there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m \\neq n$ and $x_m = x_n$.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires the use of number theory and algebraic manipulations to prove the periodicity of the sequence. The problem also requires the use of mathematical induction to show that the sequence is periodic with period 2. The problem is non-trivial because it requires the use of advanced mathematical concepts and techniques to solve.",

            "Problem: \nIn a rectangular prism with dimensions 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm, there are three mutually perpendicular planes that intersect at a point inside the prism, dividing it into eight congruent pyramids. One of the planes is parallel to the base of the prism and has a height of 3 cm. Another plane is parallel to the height of the prism and has a width of 4 cm, intersecting the first plane. The third plane is perpendicular to both of the first two planes, bisecting the width of the prism. Find the volume of the pyramid whose vertices are the intersection point and the three vertices of the base triangle formed by the intersection of the first two planes.\n\nSolution: \nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the base triangle. The intersection of the first two planes forms a right triangle with leg lengths of 4 cm and 6 cm (the width and height of the prism). The area of this triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 4 * 6 = 12 cm^2.\n\nHowever, we're interested in the base triangle formed by the intersection of the first two planes. Let's call the intersection point of the three planes P, the vertices of the base triangle are A, B and C. The line AB is parallel to the height of the prism and has a length of 4 cm. The line AC is parallel to the base of the prism and has a length of 6 cm. Since the prism is rectangular, the triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with both right angles at A and C. The area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 6 * 4 = 12 cm^2.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is the distance from the intersection point P to the base triangle ABC. Since the prism is divided into eight congruent pyramids, each pyramid has a height of 1.5 cm (height of the prism divided by 2). The height of the pyramid whose vertices are the intersection point and the three vertices of the base triangle is 3 cm (the height of the prism).\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid. The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * area of the base * height. In this case, the area of the base is 12 cm^2 and the height is 3 cm. Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is (1/3) * 12 * 3 = 12 cm^3.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it involves the intersection of three mutually perpendicular planes inside a rectangular prism, dividing it into eight congruent pyramids. The problem requires a deep understanding of 3D geometry and spatial reasoning to visualize the intersection of the planes and the resulting pyramids. The solution involves finding the area of the base triangle and the height of the pyramid, which requires careful analysis of the problem. This problem is original and non-trivial, making it a challenging puzzle in the topic of geometry.",
            "Problem: In a circular park, there are two identical semicircles, each with a radius of 10 units, connected at their ends to form a kite shape. A smaller circle is placed inside the kite such that it is tangent to both the outer semicircles and the center of the kite. The radius of the small circle is 2 units. A line is drawn from the center of the kite to the point where the smaller circle touches the outer semicircles. Find the area of the shaded region, which is the portion of the kite enclosed by the outer semicircles and not covered by the smaller circle.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the kite shape. Since the kite is made up of two identical semicircles of radius 10 units, we can find the total area of the kite by finding the area of one semicircle and multiplying it by 2.\n\nThe area of a semicircle is given by the formula A = (1/2)\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Plugging in the value of r = 10, we get A = (1/2)\u03c0(10)^2 = 50\u03c0.\n\nSince the kite is made up of two semicircles, its total area is 2 \u00d7 50\u03c0 = 100\u03c0.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the smaller circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Plugging in the value of r = 2, we get A = \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0.\n\nStep 3: Find the area of the shaded region. To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the kite.\n\nArea of shaded region = Area of kite - Area of smaller circle = 100\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 96\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is 96\u03c0.\n\nExplanation: This problem is novel and challenging because it involves a combination of geometric shapes and requires the application of different formulas to find the area of the shaded region. The problem requires the student to think critically and use their knowledge of circle and semicircle properties to solve it. The presence of the smaller circle inside the kite adds an extra layer of complexity and requires the student to consider the relationships between the different shapes.",

            "Problem: A cylindrical well of radius 10 meters and depth 20 meters is surrounded by a circular path of radius 5 meters. A cable of length 50 meters is laid from the top of the well to a point on the circular path. The cable is not attached to the well. What is the height of the point on the circular path where the cable touches the path?\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of geometry and trigonometry.\n\nLet's denote the center of the well as O, the point where the cable touches the circular path as P, and the point where the cable intersects the well as Q. We can form a right triangle OQP, where OP is the radius of the circular path (5 meters) and OQ is the radius of the well (10 meters).\n\nSince the cable is not attached to the well, we can assume that the angle OPQ is a right angle. We can also assume that the cable lies in the plane of the circular path.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of QP:\n\nQP^2 + OQ^2 = OP^2\nQP^2 + 100 = 25\nQP^2 = 225 - 100\nQP = \u221a125\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the point P. Since OP is a radius of the circular path, we can draw a line from O to P and a line from O to the center of the well (OQ). These two lines intersect at O.\n\nWe can form another right triangle OMP, where OM is the height of the point P and OP is the radius of the circular path (5 meters).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height of the point P:\n\nOM^2 + OP^2 = OQ^2\nOM^2 + 25 = 100\nOM^2 = 75\nOM = \u221a75\n\nSince OM is the height of the point P, we can find the height of the point P.\n\nExplanation: This problem is novel and challenging because it involves a combination of geometry and trigonometry. The problem requires the use of the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of QP and the height of the point P. The problem also requires the use of right triangles and the properties of circles to solve the problem.

            "Problem: \nIn a geometric puzzle, a farmer has a rectangular field with a perimeter of 240 meters and an area of 960 square meters. The field is surrounded by a fence, and the farmer wants to build a small shed in one corner of the field, which requires a platform with a square base of side length x meters. The platform must be placed such that its corner coincides with the corner of the field, and the fence must be extended to enclose the platform. The total cost of the fence is $15 per meter. The farmer has a budget of $10,000 to spend on the fence and the materials for the platform. What is the maximum area of the platform that the farmer can build?\n\nSolution: \nLet's denote the side length of the rectangular field as a and b (a > b). The perimeter of the field is given as P = 2(a + b) = 240, which implies that a + b = 120.\n\nThe area of the field is A = ab = 960.\n\nRearranging the first equation, we get b = 120 - a.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get a(120 - a) = 960.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get a = 40 and b = 80.\n\nThe side length of the square platform is x meters.\n\nThe area of the platform is Ax = x^2.\n\nThe total length of the fence required to enclose the platform is the perimeter of the field plus the perimeter of the platform, which is 2(a + b) + 4x.\n\nWe are given that the total cost of the fence is $15 per meter and the farmer has a budget of $10,000.\n\nSo, the total cost of the fence is 15(2(a + b) + 4x) = 15(2(40 + 80) + 4x) = 15(240 + 4x) = 3600 + 60x.\n\nSince the farmer has a budget of $10,000, we have the inequality 3600 + 60x \u2264 10000.\n\nSolving this inequality, we get x \u2264 (10000 - 3600)/60 = 130.\n\nThe maximum area of the platform is A_max = x^2, which is a function of x.\n\nTo find the maximum value of A_max, we take the derivative of A_max with respect to x and set it to zero: d(A_max)/dx = 2x = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 0, which is not a valid solution.\n\nHowever, we can observe that the area A_max is a quadratic function of x and is always non-negative. Therefore, we can directly evaluate A_max at the endpoint x = 130:\n\nA_max = 130^2 = 16900.\n\nHowever, this is not the maximum area of the platform because we have not yet taken into account the constraint that the platform must be placed such that its corner coincides with the corner of the field.\n\nTo find the correct maximum area, we need to consider the constraint that the platform must be placed such that its corner coincides with the corner of the field.\n\nLet's denote the distance from the corner of the field to the corner of the platform as d.\n\nThe area of the platform is still Ax = x^2.\n\nThe length of the fence required to enclose the platform is 2(a + b) + 4x + 2d.\n\nWe want to maximize A = x^2 subject to the constraint 15(2(a + b) + 4x + 2d) \u2264 10000.\n\nSince we have a and b from the previous calculations, we have a + b = 120.\n\nWe can also express the length of the fence in terms of x and d:\n\n15(2(120) + 4x + 2d) = 15(240 + 4x + 2d) = 3600 + 60x + 30d.\n\nWe want to maximize A = x^2 subject to the constraint 3600 + 60x + 30d \u2264 10000.\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between d and x.\n\nSince the platform is a square, the distance d is equal to the half of the side length of the platform, i.e., d = x/2.\n\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we get 3600 + 60x + 30(x/2) \u2264 10000.\n\nSimplifying, we get 3600 + 60x + 15x \u2264 10000.\n\nCombine like terms: 3600 + 75x \u2264 10000.\n\nSubtract 3600 from both sides: 75x \u2264 6400.\n\nDivide by 75: x \u2264 85.33.\n\nNow, we have the constraint x \u2264 85.33.\n\nThe maximum area of the platform is A_max = x^2, which is a function of x.\n\nTo find the maximum value of A_max, we take the derivative of A_max with respect to x and set it to zero: d(A_max)/dx = 2x = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 0, which is not a valid solution.\n\nHowever, we can observe that the area A_max is a quadratic function of x and is always non-negative. Therefore, we can directly evaluate A_max at the endpoint x = 85.33:\n\nA_max = 85.33^2 = 7288.89.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value of x is within the constraint x \u2264 85.33.\n\nSince x = 85.33 is within the constraint, the maximum area of the platform is indeed 7288.89 square meters.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires the application of multiple mathematical concepts, including geometry, algebra, and inequality. The farmer's budget constraint and the requirement that the platform must be placed in a specific corner of the field add an extra layer of complexity to the problem. The problem also requires the farmer to make a decision about the size of the platform, which is a real-world application of mathematical optimization. The solution involves solving a quadratic equation, evaluating a quadratic function, and considering a constraint, making it a challenging problem for students of geometry and mathematics."

            "Problem: \nThere are 5 roads connecting 5 cities (A, B, C, D, E) in a circular fashion, with each road having a different length. We will label the lengths of the roads as a, b, c, d, e, in such a way that a road from A to B is longer than a road from A to C, and a road from A to D is longer than a road from A to E. A mathematician is traveling from A to E and has 7 coins to spend on fuel. Each road costs 1 coin for travel, but if the mathematician travels on a road that is longer than the previous one, they must pay an additional 0.5 coins for the fuel consumption increase. If the mathematician travels from A to E in the most fuel-efficient way possible, what is the total amount of money they will spend on fuel?\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will analyze all the possible paths the mathematician can take from A to E. We will consider the fact that each road must be traveled in a sequential manner. \n\nLet's denote the paths by P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, where Pn represents the path from A to E involving the nth road in the circular order. \n\nFor P1 (A -> B -> C -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Since there's no increase in road length, there are no additional costs for fuel consumption increase.\n\nFor P2 (A -> B -> C -> E), the total cost is: 1 + 1 + (1 + 0.5) = 3.5. Here we have an increase of road length after the third road, resulting in an additional fuel cost of 0.5.\n\nFor P3 (A -> B -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + 1 + (1 + 0.5) = 3.5. Similar to P2, we have an increase of road length after the third road.\n\nFor P4 (A -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. This path has two increases in road length, resulting in an additional fuel cost of 1.\n\nFor P5 (A -> C -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. This path also has two increases in road length.\n\nFor P6 (A -> C -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. This path has two increases in road length.\n\nFor P7 (A -> D -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) = 2.5. Similar to P2, we have an increase of road length after the second road.\n\nFor P8 (A -> E), the total cost is: (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 3. This path has two increases in road length.\n\nNow let's look at the paths that involve traveling on a road longer than the previous one and include the first road in the circular order: \n\nFor P9 (A -> C -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5. \n\nFor P10 (A -> C -> D -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5. \n\nFor P11 (A -> C -> E -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P12 (A -> C -> E -> D), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P13 (A -> D -> C -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 4. \n\nFor P14 (A -> D -> C -> B -> E), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P15 (A -> D -> E -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P16 (A -> D -> E -> C), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P17 (A -> E -> C -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P18 (A -> E -> C -> D), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P19 (A -> E -> D -> B), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nFor P20 (A -> E -> D -> C), the total cost is: 1 + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) + (1 + 0.5) = 5.\n\nAmong these paths, the lowest cost is 2.5 (P7). Since the mathematician has 7 coins to spend on fuel, and they must travel from A to E in the most fuel-efficient way possible, the minimum amount of money they will spend on fuel is 3.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel because it involves a combination of number theory and combinatorics in a non-standard setting. The problem requires the analysis of multiple paths and their respective costs, making it a challenging problem that requires a structured approach. The additional constraint of having a limited number of coins to spend on fuel adds a layer of complexity to the problem, making it a good example of a novel and challenging problem in number theory.",
            "Problem: \nFor a given positive integer n, let P(n) be defined as the product of the smallest prime factor of n and the sum of the digits of n. For example, P(123) = 2 * (1+2+3) = 2 * 6 = 12. Consider the following sequence: n(1) = 10, n(2) = P(n(1)), n(3) = P(n(2)), and so on. What is the smallest value of k such that n(k) is a perfect square?\n\nSolution: \nWe can begin by evaluating the first few terms of the sequence:\nn(1) = 10\nn(2) = P(10) = 2 * (1+0) = 2 * 1 = 2\nn(3) = P(2) = 2 * (2) = 4\nn(4) = P(4) = 2 * (4) = 8\nn(5) = P(8) = 2 * (8) = 16\nn(6) = P(16) = 2 * (1+6) = 2 * 7 = 14\nn(7) = P(14) = 2 * (1+4) = 2 * 5 = 10\nn(8) = P(10) = 2 * (1+0) = 2 * 1 = 2\nWe observe that the sequence n(k) is periodic with a period of 4, and its values are 10, 2, 4, and 2. Since 4 is a perfect square, the smallest value of k such that n(k) is a perfect square is k=4.\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires a combination of number theory, algebraic thinking, and pattern recognition. The sequence n(k) is defined recursively, and its behavior is not immediately obvious. The problem requires the solver to analyze the properties of the sequence and identify a pattern that leads to a solution. The solution involves understanding the interplay between the smallest prime factor of n and the sum of its digits, which is a subtle and non-trivial aspect of number theory.",
            "Problem: \nLet's consider a set of 10 consecutive integers from 1 to 10. For each integer n in this set, define a function f(n) as the sum of the prime factors of n. For example, f(6) = 2 + 3 = 5, since 6 = 2 * 3 and 2 and 3 are prime factors of 6. Find the largest value of n such that f(n) is a perfect square.\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will first list the prime factorization of each integer from 1 to 10. Then, we will calculate the sum of the prime factors for each integer and check if it is a perfect square. We will keep track of the largest such n.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of each integer from 1 to 10:\n1 = 1 (no prime factors)\n2 = 2 (prime factor)\n3 = 3 (prime factor)\n4 = 2 * 2\n5 = 5 (prime factor)\n6 = 2 * 3\n7 = 7 (prime factor)\n8 = 2 * 2 * 2\n9 = 3 * 3\n10 = 2 * 5\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the prime factors for each integer:\nf(1) = 0 (not a perfect square)\nf(2) = 2 (not a perfect square)\nf(3) = 3 (not a perfect square)\nf(4) = 2 + 2 = 4 (perfect square)\nf(5) = 5 (not a perfect square)\nf(6) = 2 + 3 = 5 (not a perfect square)\nf(7) = 7 (not a perfect square)\nf(8) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 (not a perfect square)\nf(9) = 3 + 3 = 6 (not a perfect square)\nf(10) = 2 + 5 = 7 (not a perfect square)\n\nThe largest value of n such that f(n) is a perfect square is 4 with f(4) = 4.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it combines number theory with algebraic thinking. The function f(n) requires us to consider the prime factorization of each integer, which is a fundamental concept in number theory. The problem also requires us to find the sum of prime factors, which involves algebraic thinking. The twist of checking if the sum is a perfect square adds an extra layer of complexity and requires careful analysis. This problem is also non-trivial because it requires careful consideration of the prime factorization of each integer and the properties of perfect squares.",
            "Problem: \nLet $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $a > b$.

Suppose that $x_n = \\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, where $p_n$ and $q_n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Prove that there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m \\neq n$ and $x_m = x_n$.\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will first show that the sequence $x_n$ is periodic. We will then use this periodicity to find two distinct indices $m$ and $n$ such that $x_m = x_n$.\n\nLet $x_n = \\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ and $x_{n+1} = \\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}$.

We have $p_{n+1} = p_n^2 + q_n^2$ and $q_{n+1} = p_n q_n$. \n\nWe can now write $x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{x_{n+1}} = \\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}} + \\frac{q_{n+1}}{p_{n+1}} = \\frac{p_{n+1}^2 + q_{n+1}^2}{p_{n+1} q_{n+1}}$. \n\nWe can see that $p_{n+2} = p_{n+1}^2 + q_{n+1}^2 = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)^2 + (p_n q_n)^2$ and $q_{n+2} = p_{n+1} q_{n+1} = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n q_n)$. \n\nBy comparing the expressions for $p_{n+2}$ and $q_{n+2}$ with the expressions for $p_{n+1}$ and $q_{n+1}$, we can see that $p_{n+2} = p_n^4 + 2p_n^2 q_n^2 + q_n^4$ and $q_{n+2} = p_n^3 q_n + p_n q_n^3$. \n\nWe can now rewrite $x_{n+2}$ as $x_{n+2} = \\frac{p_{n+2}}{q_{n+2}} = \\frac{p_n^4 + 2p_n^2 q_n^2 + q_n^4}{p_n^3 q_n + p_n q_n^3}$. \n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring the numerator and denominator. We have $p_{n+2} = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n^2 + q_n^2) = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)^2$ and $q_{n+2} = (p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n q_n)$. \n\nTherefore, we have $x_{n+2} = \\frac{(p_n^2 + q_n^2)^2}{(p_n^2 + q_n^2)(p_n q_n)} = \\frac{p_n^2 + q_n^2}{p_n q_n} = x_n$. \n\nThis shows that the sequence $x_n$ is periodic with period 2.\n\nSince the sequence is periodic, there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m \\neq n$ and $x_m = x_n$.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires the use of number theory and algebraic manipulations to prove the periodicity of the sequence.

            "Problem: \nIn a rectangular prism with dimensions 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm, there are three mutually perpendicular planes that intersect at a point inside the prism, dividing it into eight congruent pyramids. One of the planes is parallel to the base of the prism and has a height of 3 cm. Another plane is parallel to the height of the prism and has a width of 4 cm, intersecting the first plane. The third plane is perpendicular to both of the first two planes, bisecting the width of the prism. Find the volume of the pyramid whose vertices are the intersection point and the three vertices of the base triangle formed by the intersection of the first two planes.\n\nSolution: \nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the base triangle. The intersection of the first two planes forms a right triangle with leg lengths of 4 cm and 6 cm (the width and height of the prism). The area of this triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 4 * 6 = 12 cm^2.\n\nHowever, we're interested in the base triangle formed by the intersection of the first two planes. Let's call the intersection point of the three planes P, the vertices of the base triangle are A, B and C. The line AB is parallel to the height of the prism and has a length of 4 cm. The line AC is parallel to the base of the prism and has a length of 6 cm. Since the prism is rectangular, the triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with both right angles at A and C. The area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 6 * 4 = 12 cm^2.\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the pyramid. The height of the pyramid is the distance from the intersection point P to the base triangle ABC. Since the prism is divided into eight congruent pyramids, each pyramid has a height of 1.5 cm (height of the prism divided by 2). The height of the pyramid whose vertices are the intersection point and the three vertices of the base triangle is 3 cm (the height of the prism).\n\nNow, we can find the volume of the pyramid. The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * area of the base * height. In this case, the area of the base is 12 cm^2 and the height is 3 cm. Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is (1/3) * 12 * 3 = 12 cm^3.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it involves the intersection of three mutually perpendicular planes inside a rectangular prism, dividing it into eight congruent pyramids. The problem requires a deep understanding of 3D geometry and spatial reasoning to visualize the intersection of the planes and the resulting pyramids. The solution involves finding the area of the base triangle and the height of the pyramid, which requires careful analysis of the problem. This problem is original and non-trivial, making it a challenging puzzle in the topic of geometry.",
            "Problem: In a circular park, there are two identical semicircles, each with a radius of 10 units, connected at their ends to form a kite shape. A smaller circle is placed inside the kite such that it is tangent to both the outer semicircles and the center of the kite. The radius of the small circle is 2 units. A line is drawn from the center of the kite to the point where the smaller circle touches the outer semicircles. Find the area of the shaded region, which is the portion of the kite enclosed by the outer semicircles and not covered by the smaller circle.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps.\n\nStep 1: Find the area of the kite shape. Since the kite is made up of two identical semicircles of radius 10 units, we can find the total area of the kite by finding the area of one semicircle and multiplying it by 2.\n\nThe area of a semicircle is given by the formula A = (1/2)\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Plugging in the value of r = 10, we get A = (1/2)\u03c0(10)^2 = 50\u03c0.\n\nSince the kite is made up of two semicircles, its total area is 2 \u00d7 50\u03c0 = 100\u03c0.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the smaller circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Plugging in the value of r = 2, we get A = \u03c0(2)^2 = 4\u03c0.\n\nStep 3: Find the area of the shaded region. To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the kite.\n\nArea of shaded region = Area of kite - Area of smaller circle = 100\u03c0 - 4\u03c0 = 96\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is 96\u03c0.\n\nExplanation: This problem is novel and challenging because it involves a combination of geometric shapes and requires the application of different formulas to find the area of the shaded region. The problem requires the student to think critically and use their knowledge of circle and semicircle properties to solve it. The presence of the smaller circle inside the kite adds an extra layer of complexity and requires the student to consider the relationships between the different shapes.",

We can now set up an equation to solve for $x$.\n\\begin{align*}\n2x &= 2\\sqrt{21}\\\\\nx &= \\sqrt{21}\n\\end{align*}\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires a combination of geometric reasoning and trigonometric calculations. The use of the Law of Cosines to find the length of side $BC$ adds an extra layer of complexity, making it a more engaging and difficult problem to solve. Additionally, the requirement to find the value of $x$ in terms of the given lengths and angle measures adds an element of precision and accuracy to the problem. Overall, this problem requires a deep understanding of geometric and trigonometric principles, making it a challenging and rewarding problem for geometry enthusiasts.",
            "Problem: A cylindrical well of radius 10 meters and depth 20 meters is surrounded by a circular path of radius 5 meters. A cable of length 50 meters is laid from the top of the well to a point on the circular path. The cable is not attached to the well. What is the height of the point on the circular path where the cable touches the path?\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of geometry and trigonometry.\n\nLet's denote the center of the well as O, the point where the cable touches the circular path as P, and the point where the cable intersects the well as Q. We can form a right triangle OQP, where OP is the radius of the circular path (5 meters) and OQ is the radius of the well (10 meters).\n\nSince the cable is not attached to the well, we can assume that the angle OPQ is a right angle. We can also assume that the cable lies in the plane of the circular path.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of QP:\n\nQP^2 + OQ^2 = OP^2\nQP^2 + 100 = 25\nQP^2 = 225 - 100\nQP = \u221a125\n\nNow, we need to find the height of the point P. Since OP is a radius of the circular path, we can draw a line from O to P and a line from O to the center of the well (OQ). These two lines intersect at O.\n\nWe can form another right triangle OMP, where OM is the height of the point P and OP is the radius of the circular path (5 meters).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height of the point P:\n\nOM^2 + OP^2 = OQ^2\nOM^2 + 25 = 100\nOM^2 = 75\nOM = \u221a75\n\nSince OM is the height of the point P, we can find the height of the point P.\n\nExplanation: This problem is novel and challenging because it involves a combination of geometry and trigonometry. The problem requires the use of the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of QP and the height of the point P. The problem also requires the use of right triangles and the properties of circles to solve the problem. The problem is not trivial because it involves a complex setup with multiple geometric elements, and the solution requires a clear understanding of geometric and trigonometric principles.",
            "Problem: \nIn a geometric puzzle, a farmer has a rectangular field with a perimeter of 240 meters and an area of 960 square meters. The field is surrounded by a fence, and the farmer wants to build a small shed in one corner of the field, which requires a platform with a square base of side length x meters. The platform must be placed such that its corner coincides with the corner of the field, and the fence must be extended to enclose the platform. The total cost of the fence is $15 per meter. The farmer has a budget of $10,000 to spend on the fence and the materials for the platform. What is the maximum area of the platform that the farmer can build?\n\nSolution: \nLet's denote the side length of the rectangular field as a and b (a > b). The perimeter of the field is given as P = 2(a + b) = 240, which implies that a + b = 120.\n\nThe area of the field is A = ab = 960.\n\nRearranging the first equation, we get b = 120 - a.\n\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get a(120 - a) = 960.\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get a = 40 and b = 80.\n\nThe side length of the square platform is x meters.\n\nThe area of the platform is Ax = x^2.\n\nThe total length of the fence required to enclose the platform is the perimeter of the field plus the perimeter of the platform, which is 2(a + b) + 4x.\n\nWe are given that the total cost of the fence is $15 per meter and the farmer has a budget of $10,000.\n\nSo, the total cost of the fence is 15(2(a + b) + 4x) = 15(2(40 + 80) + 4x) = 15(240 + 4x) = 3600 + 60x.\n\nSince the farmer has a budget of $10,000, we have the inequality 3600 + 60x \u2264 10000.\n\nSolving this inequality, we get x \u2264 (10000 - 3600)/60 = 130.\n\nThe maximum area of the platform is A_max = x^2, which is a function of x.\n\nTo find the maximum value of A_max, we take the derivative of A_max with respect to x and set it to zero: d(A_max)/dx = 2x = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 0, which is not a valid solution.\n\nHowever, we can observe that the area A_max is a quadratic function of x and is always non-negative. Therefore, we can directly evaluate A_max at the endpoint x = 130:\n\nA_max = 130^2 = 16900.\n\nHowever, this is not the maximum area of the platform because we have not yet taken into account the constraint that the platform must be placed such that its corner coincides with the corner of the field.\n\nTo find the correct maximum area, we need to consider the constraint that the platform must be placed such that its corner coincides with the corner of the field.\n\nLet's denote the distance from the corner of the field to the corner of the platform as d.\n\nThe area of the platform is still Ax = x^2.\n\nThe length of the fence required to enclose the platform is 2(a + b) + 4x + 2d.\n\nWe want to maximize A = x^2 subject to the constraint 15(2(a + b) + 4x + 2d) \u2264 10000.\n\nSince we have a and b from the previous calculations, we have a + b = 120.\n\nWe can also express the length of the fence in terms of x and d:\n\n15(2(120) + 4x + 2d) = 15(240 + 4x + 2d) = 3600 + 60x + 30d.\n\nWe want to maximize A = x^2 subject to the constraint 3600 + 60x + 30d \u2264 10000.\n\nNow, we need to find the relationship between d and x.\n\nSince the platform is a square, the distance d is equal to the half of the side length of the platform, i.e., d = x/2.\n\nSubstituting this into the inequality, we get 3600 + 60x + 30(x/2) \u2264 10000.\n\nSimplifying, we get 3600 + 60x + 15x \u2264 10000.\n\nCombine like terms: 3600 + 75x \u2264 10000.\n\nSubtract 3600 from both sides: 75x \u2264 6400.\n\nDivide by 75: x \u2264 85.33.\n\nNow, we have the constraint x \u2264 85.33.\n\nThe maximum area of the platform is A_max = x^2, which is a function of x.\n\nTo find the maximum value of A_max, we take the derivative of A_max with respect to x and set it to zero: d(A_max)/dx = 2x = 0.\n\nSolving for x, we get x = 0, which is not a valid solution.\n\nHowever, we can observe that the area A_max is a quadratic function of x and is always non-negative. Therefore, we can directly evaluate A_max at the endpoint x = 85.33:\n\nA_max = 85.33^2 = 7288.89.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value of x is within the constraint x \u2264 85.33.\n\nSince x = 85.33 is within the constraint, the maximum area of the platform is indeed 7288.89 square meters.\n\nExplanation: \nThis problem is novel and challenging because it requires the application of multiple mathematical concepts, including geometry, algebra, and inequality. The farmer's budget constraint and the requirement that the platform must be placed in a specific corner of the field add an extra layer of complexity to the problem. The problem also requires the farmer to make a decision about the size of the platform, which is a real-world application of mathematical optimization. The solution involves solving a quadratic equation, evaluating a quadratic function, and considering a constraint, making it a challenging problem for students of geometry and mathematics."

It requires not only a deep understanding of mathematical principles but also creativity to come up with a problem that is both novel and challenging.\n\n2. **Capabilities of LLMs**: LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating coherent text, solving standard mathematical problems, and even creating simple puzzles. However, the novelty aspect and the necessity to ensure the problem is non-trivial and solvable add layers of complexity which may go beyond the typical capabilities observed in LLMs.\n\n3. **Evaluation Criteria**: The use of an LLM judge for evaluation introduces additional uncertainty. While LLMs can follow structured criteria, the subjective elements of novelty and challenge in mathematical problems are difficult to judge accurately without human intervention. Furthermore, the logical correctness of complex mathematical solutions is challenging for even advanced LLMs to consistently evaluate.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is marked as difficult for humans, indicating that even experts might take considerable time to generate and solve such problems. This further stresses the complexity of the task for an LLM.\n\nGiven these points, an LLM's success in generating a novel, non-trivial mathematical problem, providing a correct solution, and explaining its novelty and challenge effectively is indeed surprising.
