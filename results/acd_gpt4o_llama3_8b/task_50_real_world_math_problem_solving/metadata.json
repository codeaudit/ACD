            "Step-by-step solution...\n\nTo find the time it takes to fill the tank, we need to divide the total capacity of the tank by the rate at which it is being filled.\n\nFirst, let's identify the given information:\n- The rate at which the tank is being filled is 30 liters per minute.\n- The capacity of the tank is 1200 liters.\n\nTo find the time it takes to fill the tank, we can use the formula:\nTime = Total Capacity / Rate\nIn this case, the rate is given in liters per minute, so we need to convert the capacity from liters to minutes to match the units.\n\nSince we want the answer in hours and minutes, we'll convert the result to hours and minutes.\n\nStep 1: Convert the tank's capacity to minutes\nThe capacity of the tank is 1200 liters. Since the rate is 30 liters/minute, we need to divide the capacity by the rate to get the time in minutes:\n1200 liters / 30 liters/minute = 40 minutes\n\nStep 2: Convert the result to hours and minutes\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the result to hours and minutes by dividing the minutes by 60:\n40 minutes / 60 = 0 hours and 40 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take 0 hours and 40 minutes to fill the tank completely.\n\nFinal answer: 0 hours and 40 minutes",
            "Step-by-step solution...\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes to fill the tank completely. We know the rate at which the tank is being filled (30 liters per minute) and the capacity of the tank (1200 liters).\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many minutes it will take to fill the tank completely. We can do this by dividing the capacity of the tank (1200 liters) by the rate at which it is being filled (30 liters per minute).\n\nTime to fill the tank in minutes = Capacity of the tank / Rate of filling\nTime to fill the tank in minutes = 1200 liters / 30 liters per minute\nTime to fill the tank in minutes = 40 minutes\n\nSince the question asks for the answer in hours and minutes, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours and minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide the time in minutes by 60 to get the time in hours and the remainder will be the time in minutes.\n\nTime in hours = Time in minutes / 60\nTime in hours = 40 minutes / 60\nTime in hours = 0.67 hours (approximately)\n\nTo find the time in minutes, we can multiply the time in hours by 60 and take the remainder.\n\nTime in minutes = (Time in hours * 60) % 60\nTime in minutes = (0.67 * 60) % 60\nTime in minutes = 40 minutes\n\nHowever, since we have 0.67 hours, we need to add the remaining 0.67 hours to the 40 minutes to get the total time in hours and minutes. We can multiply the remaining 0.67 hours by 60 to get the remaining minutes.\n\nRemaining minutes = 0.67 hours * 60\nRemaining minutes = 40 minutes (approximately)\n\nNow, we add the remaining minutes to the 40 minutes to get the total time in hours and minutes.\n\nTotal time = 0 hours and 40 minutes\n\nHowever, we should express the time in a more readable format, so we can write it as 40 minutes.\n\nFinal answer: 40 minutes",

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide the time in minutes by 60 to get the time in hours and the remainder will be the time in minutes.\n\nTime (hours) = Time (minutes) / 60\nTime (hours) = 40 minutes / 60\nTime (hours) = 0.67 hours (approximately)\n\nNow, we need to convert the decimal part of the hours to minutes:\nTime (minutes) = 0.67 hours * 60 minutes per hour\nTime (minutes) = 40 minutes (approximately)\n\nSo, the time it will take to fill the tank completely is approximately 0 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nFinal answer: 0 hours 40 minutes."
