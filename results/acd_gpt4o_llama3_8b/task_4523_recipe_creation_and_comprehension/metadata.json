Transfer the skillet with the chicken breasts to the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken is cooked to a safe temperature.\n\n7. While the chicken is baking, mix together lemon juice and the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a small bowl. This marinade will add a tangy and refreshing flavor to your chicken.\n\n8. After the chicken has baked for 15 minutes, brush the lemon-olive oil marinade all over the chicken breasts. Return the skillet to the oven and continue baking for an additional 5-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\n\n9. Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. This step allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender and juicy.\n\n10. Serve the Lemon Rosemary Chicken Breast hot, garnished with additional rosemary sprigs if desired.

This involves procedural knowledge, creativity, and attention to detail.\n   - **Recipe Comprehension**: Involves identifying missing steps from a given recipe, which requires understanding the logical flow and necessary steps in cooking.\n\n2. **Capability Being Measured**:\n   - **Procedural Knowledge**: The LLM needs to understand cooking processes and sequence steps logically.\n   - **Creativity**: The LLM must creatively combine the ingredients into a coherent recipe.\n   - **Attention to Detail**: The LLM must ensure no steps are omitted and all instructions are clear.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: \n   - It's categorized as difficult, indicating a high level of complexity and requiring a nuanced understanding of cooking and recipe writing.\n\n4. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - Advanced LLMs are generally good at generating coherent text and have access to a vast amount of information, including cooking and recipe-related content.\n   - They can also understand and complete tasks based on given instructions and context.\n\n5. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to assess the submission, which implies an LLM is also used to judge the correctness and completeness of the generated or analyzed recipes.\n\n6. **Agent's Performance**:\n   - The agent succeeded at the task, which means it was able to generate a detailed recipe and/or identify missing steps accurately.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- Given the capabilities of advanced LLMs, succeeding at generating a coherent recipe from a list of ingredients is well within their abilities. They can leverage extensive training data that includes recipes and procedural text to accomplish this task.\n- Similarly, identifying missing steps in a recipe involves understanding the logical sequence of cooking, which is also within the scope of an advanced LLM's capabilities.\n- The use of an LLM judge for evaluation ensures consistency in scoring based on predefined criteria.\n\n**Decision**:\n- The success of the LLM agent at this task is not particularly surprising, given the described capabilities and the nature of the task.\n\nDecision: No"
