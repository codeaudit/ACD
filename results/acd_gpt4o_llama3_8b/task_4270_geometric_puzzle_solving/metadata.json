Step-by-step solution: To find the area of a regular hexagon with a side length of 6 units, we can break it down into simpler geometric shapes whose areas we can easily calculate. \n\n   First, we draw a line from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices, dividing the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles. The area of each equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula (sqrt(3)/4) * s^2, where s is the side length of the triangle. \n\n   Since the side length of the hexagon is 6 units, the side length of each equilateral triangle is also 6 units.

Step-by-step solution: \nTo find the area of a regular hexagon with a side length of 6 units, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices. The area of the hexagon is equal to the sum of the areas of these six triangles.\n\nEach equilateral triangle has a side length of 6 units. We can find the area of one of these triangles using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: (sqrt(3)/4) * s^2, where s is the side length. Plugging in the value of 6 for s, we get: (sqrt(3)/4) * 6^2.\n\nFirst, we calculate 6^2 = 36. \nSo, the area of one equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/4) * 36. \n\nTo find the total area of the hexagon, we multiply the area of one triangle by 6: (sqrt(3)/4) * 36 * 6. We can simplify this expression by multiplying (sqrt(3)/4) by 6 first, which gives us (3*sqrt(3)/2) * 36. Then, we multiply (3*sqrt(3)/2) by 36.\n\nFirst, we multiply 3*sqrt(3) by 36, which is 108*sqrt(3). \nThen, we multiply 108*sqrt(3) by 1/2, which gives 54*sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular hexagon is 54*sqrt(3) square units.\n\n2. Explanation of geometric principles: \nWe used the concept of dividing a regular polygon into smaller shapes, in this case, equilateral triangles, to find its total area. This method is known as \"partitioning\" and is often used to simplify complex shapes by breaking them down into manageable parts.\n\nWe also used the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is given by (sqrt(3)/4) * s^2, where s is the length of the side of the equilateral triangle. This formula is based on the properties of the 30-60-90 right triangle, a special type of triangle that is formed by drawing an altitude from the vertex of an equilateral triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n3.

Step-by-step solution:\nTo find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFirst, let's draw a diagram of the rectangle and its diagonal. Imagine a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 6 units. Draw a diagonal line from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner. This diagonal line divides the rectangle into two right-angled triangles.\n\nNow, let's label the sides of the right-angled triangles. Let's call the length of the rectangle (8 units) as \"a\", the width of the rectangle (6 units) as \"b\", and the diagonal as \"c\".\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal \"c\". The theorem states that:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nSubstituting the values of \"a\" and \"b\", we get:\n\nc^2 = 8^2 + 6^2\nc^2 = 64 + 36\nc^2 = 100\n\nNow, we need to find the square root of 100 to get the value of \"c\". The square root of 100 is 10.\n\nTherefore, the length of the diagonal of the rectangle is 10 units.\n\n2. Explanation of geometric principles:\nThe Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThis theorem is based on the concept of similar triangles and the idea that the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same. In this case, the two right-angled triangles formed by the diagonal of the rectangle are similar to each other, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same.\n\n3.

Step-by-step solution:\n\nTo find the area of a regular hexagon with a side length of 6 units, we can break down the hexagon into smaller shapes whose area we can easily calculate. \n\nFirst, let's draw a diagonal of the hexagon, dividing it into two congruent triangles and a rectangle in the middle. The diagonal divides the hexagon into two equilateral triangles with a base and height of 6 units each.\n\nEach of these equilateral triangles can be split into two 30-60-90 right triangles by drawing a line from the apex of the triangle to the midpoint of the base. The side opposite the 30-degree angle in each 30-60-90 triangle is half the base of the equilateral triangle (3 units), the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the base of the equilateral triangle multiplied by \u221a3/2 (3\u221a3 units), and the hypotenuse is the base of the equilateral triangle (6 units).\n\nThe area of each 30-60-90 triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * 3\u221a3 = (9\u221a3)/2 units\u00b2.\n\nSince we have two of these triangles, their total area is 2 * (9\u221a3)/2 = 9\u221a3 units\u00b2.\n\nThe rectangle in the middle has a base of 6 units and a height of 3\u221a3 units, so its area is base * height = 6 * 3\u221a3 = 18\u221a3 units\u00b2.\n\nThe total area of the equilateral triangle is then 9\u221a3 + 18\u221a3 = 27\u221a3 units\u00b2.\n\nHowever, we made a mistake in our step-by-step solution. A hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with a side length of 6 units, which is not what we did in our step-by-step solution. Let's correct this by continuing from the beginning.\n\nA regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with a side length of 6 units.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is (s\u00b2\u221a3)/4. Therefore, the area of one of these triangles is (6\u00b2\u221a3)/4 = 9\u221a3 units\u00b2.\n\nSince there are 6 of these triangles, the total area of the hexagon is 6 * 9\u221a3 = 54\u221a3 units\u00b2.\n\n2. Explanation of geometric principles:\n\nTo solve this problem, we used the following geometric principles: \n\n* The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula (s\u00b2\u221a3)/4.\n* A regular hexagon can be divided into smaller shapes whose area we can easily calculate.\n* 30-60-90 triangles are used to split the equilateral triangles into simpler shapes.\n\n3. Diagram description:\n\nImagine a regular hexagon with a side length of 6 units. Draw a diagonal from one vertex to the opposite vertex, dividing the hexagon into two equilateral triangles and a rectangle in the middle. Then draw lines from the apex of each equilateral triangle to the midpoint of the base, splitting the equilateral triangle into a 30-60-90 triangle and a 30-60-90 triangle.\n\nAlternatively, you can draw the equilateral triangles that make up the hexagon and use the 30-60-90 triangles to find the area of each triangle.\n\nAnswer: 54\u221a3",
            "1. Step-by-step solution: \nTo find the area of a regular hexagon with a side length of 6 units, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices. The area of the hexagon is equal to the sum of the areas of these six triangles.\n\nEach equilateral triangle has a side length of 6 units. We can find the area of one of these triangles using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: (sqrt(3)/4) * s^2, where s is the side length. Plugging in the value of 6 for s, we get: (sqrt(3)/4) * 6^2.\n\nFirst, we calculate 6^2 = 36. \nSo, the area of one equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3)/4) * 36. \n\nTo find the total area of the hexagon, we multiply the area of one triangle by 6: (sqrt(3)/4) * 36 * 6. We can simplify this expression by multiplying (sqrt(3)/4) by 6 first, which gives us (3*sqrt(3)/2) * 36. Then, we multiply (3*sqrt(3)/2) by 36.\n\nFirst, we multiply 3*sqrt(3) by 36, which is 108*sqrt(3). \nThen, we multiply 108*sqrt(3) by 1/2, which gives 54*sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the area of the regular hexagon is 54*sqrt(3) square units.\n\n2. Explanation of geometric principles: \nWe used the concept of dividing a regular polygon into smaller shapes, in this case, equilateral triangles, to find its total area. This method is known as \"partitioning\" and is often used to simplify complex shapes by breaking them down into manageable parts.\n\nWe also used the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is given by (sqrt(3)/4) * s^2, where s is the length of the side of the equilateral triangle. This formula is based on the properties of the 30-60-90 right triangle, a special type of triangle that is formed by drawing an altitude from the vertex of an equilateral triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n3.

This creates six equilateral triangles, each with a side length of 6 units."

Step-by-step solution:\nTo find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFirst, let's draw a diagram of the rectangle and its diagonal. Imagine a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 6 units. Draw a diagonal line from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner. This diagonal line divides the rectangle into two right-angled triangles.\n\nNow, let's label the sides of the right-angled triangles. Let's call the length of the rectangle (8 units) as \"a\", the width of the rectangle (6 units) as \"b\", and the diagonal as \"c\".\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal \"c\".

In this case, the two right-angled triangles formed by the diagonal of the rectangle are similar to each other, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same.\n\n3.
