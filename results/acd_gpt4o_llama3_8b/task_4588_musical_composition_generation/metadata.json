Determine the key and mood of the piece: A serene morning in a forest suggests a peaceful and calming atmosphere, which can be achieved through the use of gentle melodies and soothing harmonies. A key that fits this mood is G major, as it has a bright and airy feel to it.\n2. Create a melody that evokes the feeling of a serene morning: I will use a combination of stepwise motion and leaps to create a sense of movement and interest. The melody will feature a mix of ascending and descending phrases to create a sense of forward motion.\n3. Include a modulation to add interest and variety: A modulation to a key that is related to G major, such as C major, will create a sense of surprise and add interest to the piece. I will use a modulation to C major in the middle of the piece, and then return to G major in the final section.\n4. Add harmony and texture: To add depth and interest to the piece, I will use chords and harmonies that fit the mood and key of the piece.

            "To create a musical composition based on the given theme and constraints, I will first brainstorm ideas for a bustling city at night. I will consider the sounds, rhythms, and emotions associated with a city at night, such as the hum of traffic, the chatter of pedestrians, and the sense of energy and excitement.\n\nFor the time signature, I will use 3/4, which is often associated with waltzes and has a lively, swaying feel. This will help to convey the sense of movement and energy in the city.\n\nFor the key change, I will start in a minor key to create a sense of tension and anticipation, and then modulate to a major key to convey the sense of excitement and joy that comes with being in a bustling city at night.\n\nHere is my plan for the composition:\n\n* Introduce the theme with a minor key (e.g., A minor) and a lively rhythm, using notes such as A, C, and E to create a sense of tension and anticipation.\n* Use a series of descending arpeggios (broken chords played in a smooth, flowing manner) to create a sense of movement and energy, with notes such as A, G, and F to create a sense of momentum.\n* Modulate to a major key (e.g., C major) to convey the sense of excitement and joy, using notes such as C, E, and G to create a sense of resolution and happiness.\n* Use a series of ascending arpeggios to create a sense of uplift and celebration, with notes such as C, D, and E to create a sense of joy and triumph.\n\nHere is the ABC notation for the composition:\n\nX: 1\nT: City at Night\nM: 3/4\nK: A\nA4 E4 A4 | G4 F4 E4 | D4 C4 D4 |\nG4 F4 E4 | D4 C4 D4 | E4 G4 A4 |\nK: C\nC4 E4 G4 | C4 E4 G4 | A4 G4 F4 |\nE4 D4 C4 | D4 C4 D4 | E4 G4 A4 |\n\nThis composition uses a lively 3/4 time signature and includes a minor-to-major key change, as required.

The task asks for a musical composition in standard ABC notation with a 3/4 time signature, adhering to the theme of a bustling city at night and including a minor-to-major key change. \n\nI'll start by defining the theme in musical terms. A bustling city at night could be represented by a fast-paced, energetic melody with a sense of movement and activity. This could involve the use of syncopated rhythms, rising arpeggios, and perhaps a hint of dissonance to convey the chaos and energy of the city.\n\nNext, I'll consider the minor-to-major key change. This could be achieved by starting in a minor key, such as A minor, and then modulating to a major key, such as C major, to convey a sense of brightness and optimism. This change could be marked by a clear modulation in the notation, such as 'K: C'.\n\nNow, let's start building the composition.

However, generating coherent and musically correct compositions in ABC notation adds an additional layer of complexity.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge:** The evaluation method (`eval_with_llm_judge`) relies on another LLM to judge the output based on criteria.
