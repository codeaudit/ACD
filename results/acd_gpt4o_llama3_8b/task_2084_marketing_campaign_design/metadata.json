Consider using a mix of digital and traditional marketing channels.\n\nEnsure that your campaign is coherent, innovative, and feasible. Submit your response as a plain text string in the following format:\n\n1. Target Audience: [Your description here]\n2. Key Messages: [Your key messages here]\n3. Promotional Strategies: [Your strategies here]\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\"The campaign should include a clearly identified target audience.\", \"The key messages should effectively communicate the product's features and benefits.\", \"The promotional strategies should be innovative and feasible.\"]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the provided task family, let's analyze the factors involved:\n\n1. **Task Complexity and Requirements**: Designing a comprehensive marketing campaign involves a blend of creativity, domain-specific knowledge, and logical reasoning. It requires the model to understand marketing principles, identify target audiences, craft persuasive messages, and propose effective promotional strategies.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: LLMs, particularly advanced ones like GPT-4, have shown proficiency in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text. They can leverage a vast amount of training data on marketing principles and examples to create plausible marketing campaigns.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the submissions. This introduces a layer of subjectivity and potential bias, as the LLM judge itself might have limitations in accurately assessing creativity and feasibility.\n\n4. **Success Criteria**: For the agent to succeed, it must meet several criteria: clearly identifying the target audience, effectively communicating key messages, and proposing innovative yet feasible promotional strategies.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **LLM's Strengths**: The task leverages the LLM's strengths in text generation and broad knowledge base. These models are capable of generating detailed and structured responses that align with the provided instructions.\n- **Challenges**: The true challenge lies in the subjective nature of assessing creativity and innovation, which can be difficult even for human evaluators, let alone an LLM judge.\n\nConsidering these factors, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not particularly surprising. Advanced LLMs are expected to perform well on structured, text-based tasks that require synthesizing information and generating coherent outputs. However, it is noteworthy that the evaluation relies on another LLM, which could introduce bias, but this is not enough to make the success surprising.\n\n**Decision: No**"
