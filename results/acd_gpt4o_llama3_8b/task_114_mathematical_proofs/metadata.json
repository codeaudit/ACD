            "**Problem:** Prove that the square root of 2 is irrational.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* Let's assume that \u221a2 is rational, meaning it can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b \u2260 0.\n* We will also assume that a and b have no common factors other than 1, meaning their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.\n\n**Step 1: Express \u221a2 as a fraction**\n\nIf \u221a2 is rational, then it can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers and b \u2260 0. We can write:\n\n\u221a2 = a/b\n\n**Step 2: Square both sides of the equation**\n\nTo eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:\n\n(\u221a2)^2 = (a/b)^2\n\nUsing the property of exponents, we get:\n\n2 = a^2/b^2\n\n**Step 3: Multiply both sides by b^2**\n\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by b^2:\n\n2b^2 = a^2\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the equation**\n\nSince 2b^2 is even (because it is a multiple of 2), we can conclude that a^2 is also even. This means that a must be even, as the square of an odd number is always odd.\n\n**Step 5: Show that a is divisible by 2**\n\nSince a is even, we can write a = 2k, where k is an integer. Substituting this into the equation 2b^2 = a^2, we get:\n\n2b^2 = (2k)^2\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\n2b^2 = 4k^2\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nb^2 = 2k^2\n\nThis shows that b^2 is even, and therefore b must also be even.\n\n**Step 6: Reach a contradiction**\n\nWe started by assuming that a and b have no common factors other than 1. However, we have now shown that both a and b are even, which means they share a common factor of 2. This contradicts our initial assumption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have reached a contradiction, which means that our initial assumption that \u221a2 is rational must be false. Therefore, we conclude that \u221a2 is irrational.\n\n**Justification:**\n\nThis proof relies on the following mathematical principles and theorems:\n\n* The property of exponents: (a/b)^n = a^n/b^n\n* The property of even numbers: the square of an even number is even\n* The definition of rational numbers: a rational number can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b \u2260 0\n* The definition of greatest common divisor (GCD): the GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder\n\n**Answer:** \u221a2 is irrational.",
            "Here's the proof that the square root of 2 is irrational:\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nProve that \u221a2 is an irrational number, i.e., it cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.\n\n**Assumptions:**\nWe assume that \u221a2 is rational, i.e., it can be expressed as a ratio of integers, a/b, where a and b are integers and b is non-zero.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. Assume that \u221a2 = a/b, where a and b are integers and b is non-zero.\n2. Since \u221a2 = a/b, we have (2)^2 = (a/b)^2, which simplifies to 2 = a^2/b^2.\n3. Cross-multiplying, we get 2b^2 = a^2.\n4. Since 2b^2 is an even number, a^2 must also be an even number.\n5. By definition, if a^2 is even, then a must also be even. Let a = 2k, where k is an integer.\n6. Substituting a = 2k into the equation 2b^2 = a^2, we get 2b^2 = (2k)^2, which simplifies to 2b^2 = 4k^2.\n7. Dividing both sides by 2, we get b^2 = 2k^2.\n8.

            "To prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, we follow these steps:\n\nProblem: Prove the irrationality of \u221a2.\n\nAssumptions: We assume that \u221a2 is rational and that it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers a and b, where b is non-zero. This can be written as \u221a2 = a/b, where gcd(a, b) = 1 (greatest common divisor of a and b is 1).\n\nStep 1: Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. This results in 2 = a^2/b^2. \n\nJustification: This step is based on the algebraic property of equality, which allows us to perform operations on both sides of an equation.\n\nStep 2: Multiply both sides by b^2 to get rid of the denominator. This yields 2b^2 = a^2.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\nStep 3: Subtract a^2 from both sides to isolate the term involving b^2. This gives 2b^2 - a^2 = 0.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the additive inverse property, which allows us to subtract the same value from both sides of an equation.\n\nStep 4: Factor the left side of the equation as a difference of squares. This can be written as (a^2 - 2b^2) = 0.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the algebraic identity for difference of squares, which states that a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b).\n\nStep 5: Factor the left side of the equation further by factoring out 2. This gives 2b^2 - a^2 = (a - \u221a2b)(a + \u221a2b) = 0.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\nStep 6: Since the equation equals 0, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve for a and b. This results in two possible solutions: a - \u221a2b = 0 or a + \u221a2b = 0.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the zero-product property, which states that if the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers must be 0.\n\nStep 7: If a - \u221a2b = 0, then a = \u221a2b.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the additive inverse property, which allows us to add \u221a2b to both sides of the equation.\n\nStep 8: If a + \u221a2b = 0, then a = -\u221a2b.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the additive inverse property, which allows us to add -\u221a2b to both sides of the equation.\n\nStep 9: In either case, we have that a is a multiple of \u221a2. Since we assumed that a is an integer, this means that \u221a2 is a rational number because it is a multiple of an integer.\n\nJustification: This step is based on the definition of rational numbers, which states that a rational number is a number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers.\n\nStep 10: However, we also assumed that \u221a2 is irrational.

            "content": "Given that this task involves generating or completing mathematical proofs, it inherently requires a high level of logical reasoning and the ability to follow formal mathematical structures. Large language models, while adept at generating human-like text and even handling some logical reasoning tasks, often struggle with the precision and rigor required in advanced mathematical proofs. \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Logical Reasoning and Structured Thinking**: LLMs can handle basic logical structures and simple proofs, but complex or nuanced proofs often elude their capabilities.\n2. **Formal Language Comprehension**: LLMs have shown a mixed performance in understanding and generating formal, structured text, especially in highly specialized fields like advanced mathematics.\n3. **Task Difficulty**: Given that the estimated human difficulty is \"very difficult,\" it implies that the task is challenging even for human experts, suggesting that it would be particularly challenging for an LLM.\n\nConsidering the details in the task:\n\n- The problem of proving that the sum of two even numbers is always even is relatively simple and straightforward, even though it still requires a clear logical structure.\n- Proving that the square root of 2 is irrational is much more complex and requires a deep understanding of number theory and proof techniques.\n\nGiven these considerations and the historical performance of LLMs on similar tasks, an LLM successfully completing a proof that the sum of two even numbers is always even might not be particularly surprising. However, successfully generating a correct and coherent proof for a more complex problem like proving the square root of 2 is irrational would be significantly more noteworthy.\n\nSince the provided result indicates that the agent succeeded at the task without specifying which problem was solved, and considering the complexity and difficulty of the task family overall, the success of the LLM is indeed noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
