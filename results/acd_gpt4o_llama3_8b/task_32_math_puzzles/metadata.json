However, their performance can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the puzzle and the need for deeper mathematical understanding and pattern recognition.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The tasks are described as \"difficult\" for humans, which might indicate they require a higher level of problem-solving skills and possibly some advanced mathematical knowledge. The example provided involves recognizing a pattern in a sequence, which may not be trivial.\n\n3. **Agent's Success**: The agent succeeded at the task. Given that the task involves recognizing a non-trivial pattern in a sequence, this could be considered noteworthy because such tasks can be challenging even for humans.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The success is determined by `eval_with_llm_judge`, which suggests that another LLM is used to evaluate the correctness of the response. If the evaluation criteria are clear and the LLM judge is reliable, the success should be accurately assessed.\n\nConsidering the above points, the success of the LLM in solving a difficult mathematical puzzle involving pattern recognition is somewhat surprising given the known limitations of LLMs in consistently handling complex mathematical reasoning tasks.\n\nDecision: Yes"
