            "1. Explanation: \nRSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. It is an asymmetric encryption technique that involves a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.\n\nThe key generation process for RSA encryption involves the following steps:\n\n- Choose two large prime numbers, p and q. These prime numbers are kept secret and are used to generate the public and private keys.\n- Calculate the modulus n, which is the product of p and q: n = p * q.\n- Calculate the Euler's totient function (\u03c6(n)), which is (p-1) * (q-1). This value is crucial in determining the public key (e) and private key (d).\n- Choose a public key e, which is a number that is coprime with \u03c6(n). In other words, e and \u03c6(n) have no common factors other than 1. Typically, e is chosen to be a small prime number.\n- Calculate the private key d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n). This means that d*e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n)). The modular multiplicative inverse can be calculated using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe RSA encryption process involves the following steps:\n\n- Encryption: c \u2261 m^e (mod n), where c is the ciphertext, m is the plaintext, and e is the public key.\n- Decryption: m \u2261 c^d (mod n), where m is the plaintext, c is the ciphertext, and d is the private key.\n\nIn the context of the given problem, we are provided with two prime numbers, p = 61 and q = 53, and a public key e = 17. We need to calculate the public key (n, e) and the private key (d).\n\n2. Problem Solution: \nGiven p = 61 and q = 53, we can calculate the modulus n as follows:\nn = p * q\n= 61 * 53\n= 3233\n\nNext, we calculate Euler's totient function (\u03c6(n)):\n\u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n= (61-1) * (53-1)\n= 60 * 52\n= 3120\n\nWe are given the public key e = 17. To verify that e is indeed coprime with \u03c6(n), we can check if they have any common factors:\ngcd(e, \u03c6(n)) = gcd(17, 3120)\nSince the greatest common divisor is 1, we confirm that e and \u03c6(n) are coprime.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the private key d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n). We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\nd \u2261 e^(-1) (mod \u03c6(n))\n= 17^(-1) (mod 3120)\n\nTo find the modular multiplicative inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n3120 = 183 * 17 + 3\n17 = 5 * 3 + 2\n3 = 1 * 2 + 1\n2 = 2 * 1 + 0\n\nNow, we can work backwards to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\n1 = 3 - 1 * 2\n= 3 - 1 * (17 - 5 * 3)\n= 6 * 3 - 1 * 17\n= 6 * (3120 - 183 * 17) - 1 * 17\n= 6 * 3120 - 1093 * 17\n\nTherefore, we have found the modular multiplicative inverse:\n17^(-1) \u2261 -1093 (mod 3120)\n\nSince the private key d is typically a positive number, we can add \u03c6(n) to the result to obtain a positive value:\nd \u2261 -1093 + 3120\n= 2027\n\nTherefore, the public key (n, e) and the private key (d) for RSA encryption are:\nPublic key: (n, e) = (3233, 17)\nPrivate key: d = 2027",
            "1. Explanation:\n\nRSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the principles of number theory and modular arithmetic. The algorithm involves a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key consists of two components: n, the modulus (product of two large prime numbers p and q), and e, the public exponent. The private key consists of the modulus n and a private exponent d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)(q-1).\n\nTo generate the RSA keys, we first need to calculate the modulus n as the product of two large prime numbers p and q. We are given p = 61 and q = 53. Next, we need to calculate Euler's totient function, denoted as \u03c6(n), which is the product of (p-1) and (q-1). We then choose an e, the public exponent, which is given as 17.\n\nThe private key d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n). In other words, d is the number such that ed \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n)). To find d, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or the multiplicative inverse algorithm to compute the modular inverse.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the modulus n as the product of p and q.\nn = p * q = 61 * 53 = 3233\n\nStep 2: Calculate Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) as the product of (p-1) and (q-1).\n\u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (61-1) * (53-1) = 60 * 52 = 3120\n\nStep 3: Choose the public exponent e = 17.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the private exponent d as the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n) using the multiplicative inverse algorithm.\n\nTo find the modular inverse of e = 17 modulo \u03c6(n) = 3120, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or the multiplicative inverse algorithm. However, in this case, we can also use the fact that 17 * 185 \u2261 1 (mod 3120) is not true, but 17 * 185 = 3135 = 1 + 3015, and 3015 is divisible by 3120 - 15. So 17 * 185 = 1 + k * 3120 for some k. But 187 * 17 = 3189 = 1 + 3120, therefore  17 * 185 = 1 + k * 3120 = 137 * 23 = 3171, 187 * 17 = 3189 = 1 + 3120.

Explanation: \nRSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the mathematical principles of modular arithmetic and the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. It involves a pair of keys: a public key used for encryption and a private key used for decryption. The security of RSA lies in the computational difficulty of factoring a large composite number into its prime factors.\n\nThe public key is a pair of numbers (n, e), where n is the modulus, and e is the public exponent. The private key is a pair of numbers (n, d), where n is the same modulus, and d is the private exponent.\n\nTo create an RSA key pair, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose two large prime numbers, p and q.\n2. Compute n = p * q, which is the modulus.\n3. Compute the totient function, \u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1).\n4. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < \u03c6(n) and gcd(e, \u03c6(n)) = 1.\n5. Compute d such that d*e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n)).\n6. The public key is (n, e), and the private key is (n, d).\n\nThe security of RSA relies on the difficulty of computing d from e and n. This is known as the RSA problem, which is believed to be computationally infeasible.\n\n2. Problem Solution: \n\nGiven p = 61 and q = 53, we can calculate n and \u03c6(n) as follows:\n\nn = p * q = 61 * 53 = 3233\n\u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (61-1) * (53-1) = 60 * 52 = 3120\n\nWe are given e = 17. To find d, we need to solve the equation:\n\nd*e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n))\n\nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n):\n\n17*187 \u2261 1 (mod 3120)\nd \u2261 187 (mod 3120)\n\nThe public key is (n, e) = (3233, 17), and the private key is (n, d) = (3233, 187)."

It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. In the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, a keyword is used to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext message. The keyword is repeated as necessary to match the length of the plaintext. Each letter of the plaintext is then shifted by the corresponding letter of the keyword, shifted by its alphabetical position in the keyword.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n- First, convert the plaintext to a series of numerical values based on the alphabetical position of each letter (A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25).\n- Next, convert the key to the same numerical system.\n- To encrypt, add the corresponding numerical values of the plaintext and the keyword together and take the modulus of the result by 26 to ensure the value stays within the 0-25 range.\n- The resulting numerical values represent the encrypted text.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\nGiven the plaintext message 'HELLO' and a key 'XMCKL', the first step is to convert the plaintext and the key to numerical values:\n\nPlaintext: H=7, E=4, L=11, L=11, O=14\nKey: X=23, M=12, C=2, K=10, L=11\n\nNext, we repeat the key to match the length of the plaintext by repeating the key: XMCKLXMCKL.\n\nNow, we perform the Vigen\u00e8re cipher encryption by adding the corresponding numerical values of the plaintext and the key together, and taking the modulus of the result by 26:\n\nH (7) + X (23) = 30 % 26 = 4\nE (4) + M (12) = 16 % 26 = 16\nL (11) + C (2) = 13 % 26 = 13\nL (11) + K (10) = 21 % 26 = 21\nO (14) + L (11) = 25 % 26 = 25\n\nThe encrypted message is: 4 16 13 21 25\n\nConverting the numerical values back to letters, the encrypted message is: UQSTZ",

In this case, we're using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift the plaintext letters. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which means that a different Caesar cipher is used for each letter of the plaintext based on the corresponding letter of the keyword.\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher uses a keyword to shift the plaintext letters. The keyword is repeated to match the length of the plaintext, and each letter of the keyword is used as an offset for the corresponding letter of the plaintext. The offset is determined by the position of the keyword letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.).\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a type of symmetric key encryption because the same keyword is used for both encryption and decryption. To decrypt the ciphertext, you would use the same keyword to shift the ciphertext letters back to their original positions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the Vigen\u00e8re cipher:\n\n- Take the plaintext message and the keyword.\n- Convert the keyword to a numerical sequence (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.).\n- Repeat the numerical sequence to match the length of the plaintext.\n- Add the numerical sequence to the corresponding plaintext letters, taking into account the wraparound (0+26=26, 1+26=0, etc.).\n- Convert the resulting numerical sequence back to letters.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n \nGiven the plaintext message 'HELLO' and the key 'XMCKL', we will encrypt the message using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher.\n\nFirst, we convert the keyword to a numerical sequence:\n \nX -> 23\nM -> 12\nC -> 2\nK -> 10\nL -> 11\n\nSince the keyword is shorter than the plaintext, we repeat it to match the length of the plaintext:\n \n23 12 2 10 11 23 12 2 10 11\n\nNext, we convert the plaintext message to a numerical sequence:\n \nH -> 7\nE -> 4\nL -> 11\nL -> 11\nO -> 14\n\nWe add the numerical sequence to the corresponding plaintext letters, taking into account the wraparound:\n \n7 + 23 = 30 (30 % 26 = 4) = E\n4 + 12 = 16 (16 % 26 = 16) = Q (wraparound occurs)\n11 + 2 = 13 (13 % 26 = 13) = N\n11 + 10 = 21 (21 % 26 = 21) = V\n14 + 11 = 25 (25 % 26 = 25) = Z\n7 + 23 = 30 (30 % 26 = 4) = E\n4 + 12 = 16 (16 % 26 = 16) = Q (wraparound occurs)\n11 + 2 = 13 (13 % 26 = 13) = N\n14 + 10 = 24 (24 % 26 = 24) = Y\n11 + 11 = 22 (22 % 26 = 22) = W\n\nWe convert the resulting numerical sequence back to letters:\n \nE Q N V Z E Q N Y W\n\nThe encrypted message is: EQNVZEQNYW",

This means that the sender and the receiver must share the same key to ensure secure communication. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a specific type of symmetric key encryption that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher works by using a series of Caesar ciphers, where each letter of the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions based on the corresponding letter of the keyword. The number of positions is determined by the alphabetical position of the keyword letter, with A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on.\n\nFor example, if the keyword is 'XMCKL' and the plaintext is 'HELLO', the encryption process would work as follows:\n\n- H (8) + X (23) = 31 (mod 26) = 5 (since 31 mod 26 = 5)\n- E (4) + M (12) = 16 (mod 26) = 16\n- L (11) + C (2) = 13 (mod 26) = 13\n- L (11) + K (10) = 21 (mod 26) = 21\n- O (14) + L (11) = 25 (mod 26) = 25\n\nThe resulting ciphertext would be 'NQGNN'.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nGiven the plaintext message 'HELLO' and the key 'XMCKL', we can encrypt the message using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher as follows:\n\n1. Convert the plaintext message to alphabetical positions:\n   H = 8, E = 4, L = 11, L = 11, O = 14\n\n2. Convert the key to alphabetical positions:\n   X = 23, M = 12, C = 2, K = 10, L = 11\n\n3. Encrypt each letter of the plaintext by adding the corresponding letter of the key:\n   H (8) + X (23) = 31 (mod 26) = 5\n   E (4) + M (12) = 16 (mod 26) = 16\n   L (11) + C (2) = 13 (mod 26) = 13\n   L (11) + K (10) = 21 (mod 26) = 21\n   O (14) + L (11) = 25 (mod 26) = 25\n\n4. Convert the resulting alphabetical positions back to letters:\n   5 = N, 16 = Q, 13 = N, 21 = V, 25 = Y\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is 'NQNVY'.",

            "1. Explanation: RSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the principles of number theory to ensure secure data transmission. The algorithm involves a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key is used to encrypt messages, while the private key is used to decrypt them.\n\nThe RSA algorithm works as follows:\n\n* Two large prime numbers, p and q, are chosen randomly. These prime numbers are used to calculate the modulus n, which is the product of p and q (n = p \u00d7 q).\n* The public key (n, e) is calculated using the formula n = p \u00d7 q and e = 3 (k) (where k is Euler's totient function, which is calculated as k = (p-1) \u00d7 (q-1)). The value of e is usually chosen to be a small prime number, such as 17 or 65537.\n* The private key (d) is calculated using the formula d = e^(-1) mod k, where d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo k.\n\nTo ensure the security of the RSA algorithm, the following conditions must be met:\n\n* The modulus n must be a product of two distinct prime numbers, p and q.\n* The public exponent e must be a small prime number, usually chosen to be 17 or 65537.\n* The private exponent d must be a number that is congruent to 1 modulo k.\n\nIn this problem, we are given two prime numbers p = 61 and q = 53, and we are asked to calculate the public key (n, e) and the private key (d) for RSA encryption using e = 17.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the modulus n\nn = p \u00d7 q\nn = 61 \u00d7 53\nn = 3233\n\nStep 2: Calculate Euler's totient function k\nk = (p-1) \u00d7 (q-1)\nk = (61-1) \u00d7 (53-1)\nk = 60 \u00d7 52\nk = 3120\n\nStep 3: Calculate the public key (n, e)\nn = 3233\ne = 17\n\nStep 4: Calculate the private key (d)\nd = e^(-1) mod k\nd = 17^(-1) mod 3120\nTo calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of 17 modulo 3120, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nUsing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find the coefficients x and y such that 17x + 3120y = 1. Solving for x, we get x = 1931.\n\nTherefore, d = 17^(-1) mod 3120\nd = 1931\n\nAnswer: n = 3233, e = 17, d = 1931",
            "1. Explanation: \nRSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. It is an asymmetric encryption technique that involves a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.\n\nThe key generation process for RSA encryption involves the following steps:\n\n- Choose two large prime numbers, p and q. These prime numbers are kept secret and are used to generate the public and private keys.\n- Calculate the modulus n, which is the product of p and q: n = p * q.\n- Calculate the Euler's totient function (\u03c6(n)), which is (p-1) * (q-1). This value is crucial in determining the public key (e) and private key (d).\n- Choose a public key e, which is a number that is coprime with \u03c6(n). In other words, e and \u03c6(n) have no common factors other than 1. Typically, e is chosen to be a small prime number.\n- Calculate the private key d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n). This means that d*e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n)). The modular multiplicative inverse can be calculated using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe RSA encryption process involves the following steps:\n\n- Encryption: c \u2261 m^e (mod n), where c is the ciphertext, m is the plaintext, and e is the public key.\n- Decryption: m \u2261 c^d (mod n), where m is the plaintext, c is the ciphertext, and d is the private key.\n\nIn the context of the given problem, we are provided with two prime numbers, p = 61 and q = 53, and a public key e = 17. We need to calculate the public key (n, e) and the private key (d).\n\n2. Problem Solution: \nGiven p = 61 and q = 53, we can calculate the modulus n as follows:\nn = p * q\n= 61 * 53\n= 3233\n\nNext, we calculate Euler's totient function (\u03c6(n)):\n\u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)\n= (61-1) * (53-1)\n= 60 * 52\n= 3120\n\nWe are given the public key e = 17. To verify that e is indeed coprime with \u03c6(n), we can check if they have any common factors:\ngcd(e, \u03c6(n)) = gcd(17, 3120)\nSince the greatest common divisor is 1, we confirm that e and \u03c6(n) are coprime.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the private key d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n). We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\nd \u2261 e^(-1) (mod \u03c6(n))\n= 17^(-1) (mod 3120)\n\nTo find the modular multiplicative inverse, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm:\n3120 = 183 * 17 + 3\n17 = 5 * 3 + 2\n3 = 1 * 2 + 1\n2 = 2 * 1 + 0\n\nNow, we can work backwards to find the modular multiplicative inverse:\n1 = 3 - 1 * 2\n= 3 - 1 * (17 - 5 * 3)\n= 6 * 3 - 1 * 17\n= 6 * (3120 - 183 * 17) - 1 * 17\n= 6 * 3120 - 1093 * 17\n\nTherefore, we have found the modular multiplicative inverse:\n17^(-1) \u2261 -1093 (mod 3120)\n\nSince the private key d is typically a positive number, we can add \u03c6(n) to the result to obtain a positive value:\nd \u2261 -1093 + 3120\n= 2027\n\nTherefore, the public key (n, e) and the private key (d) for RSA encryption are:\nPublic key: (n, e) = (3233, 17)\nPrivate key: d = 2027",
            "1. Explanation:\n\nRSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the principles of number theory and modular arithmetic. The algorithm involves a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key consists of two components: n, the modulus (product of two large prime numbers p and q), and e, the public exponent. The private key consists of the modulus n and a private exponent d, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo (p-1)(q-1).\n\nTo generate the RSA keys, we first need to calculate the modulus n as the product of two large prime numbers p and q. We are given p = 61 and q = 53. Next, we need to calculate Euler's totient function, denoted as \u03c6(n), which is the product of (p-1) and (q-1). We then choose an e, the public exponent, which is given as 17.\n\nThe private key d is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n). In other words, d is the number such that ed \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n)). To find d, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or the multiplicative inverse algorithm to compute the modular inverse.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the modulus n as the product of p and q.\nn = p * q = 61 * 53 = 3233\n\nStep 2: Calculate Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) as the product of (p-1) and (q-1).\n\u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (61-1) * (53-1) = 60 * 52 = 3120\n\nStep 3: Choose the public exponent e = 17.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the private exponent d as the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n) using the multiplicative inverse algorithm.\n\nTo find the modular inverse of e = 17 modulo \u03c6(n) = 3120, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm or the multiplicative inverse algorithm. However, in this case, we can also use the fact that 17 * 185 \u2261 1 (mod 3120) is not true, but 17 * 185 = 3135 = 1 + 3015, and 3015 is divisible by 3120 - 15. So 17 * 185 = 1 + k * 3120 for some k. But 187 * 17 = 3189 = 1 + 3120, therefore  17 * 185 = 1 + k * 3120 = 137 * 23 = 3171, 187 * 17 = 3189 = 1 + 3120. Therefore 17 * 185 = 1 + 15 * 3120 + 171, 171 = 1 + 15 * 11 + 6 = 137 * 23 + 6. Then 187 * 17 = 1 + 15 * 3120 + 171 =137 * 23 + 15 * 3120 + 6 = 1 + 15 * 3120 + 6.137 * 23 + 6 = 1 + 15 * 3120 + 6 *  17 * 11 = 1 + 15 * 3120 + 6. 6 = 137 * 23 + 6.6 = 6 * 17 = 102137 * 23 = 1 + 15 *

Explanation: \nRSA encryption is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the mathematical principles of modular arithmetic and the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. It involves a pair of keys: a public key used for encryption and a private key used for decryption. The security of RSA lies in the computational difficulty of factoring a large composite number into its prime factors.\n\nThe public key is a pair of numbers (n, e), where n is the modulus, and e is the public exponent. The private key is a pair of numbers (n, d), where n is the same modulus, and d is the private exponent.\n\nTo create an RSA key pair, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose two large prime numbers, p and q.\n2. Compute n = p * q, which is the modulus.\n3. Compute the totient function, \u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1).\n4. Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < \u03c6(n) and gcd(e, \u03c6(n)) = 1.\n5. Compute d such that d*e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n)).\n6. The public key is (n, e), and the private key is (n, d).\n\nThe security of RSA relies on the difficulty of computing d from e and n. This is known as the RSA problem, which is believed to be computationally infeasible.\n\n2. Problem Solution: \n\nGiven p = 61 and q = 53, we can calculate n and \u03c6(n) as follows:\n\nn = p * q = 61 * 53 = 3233\n\u03c6(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) = (61-1) * (53-1) = 60 * 52 = 3120\n\nWe are given e = 17. To find d, we need to solve the equation:\n\nd*e \u2261 1 (mod \u03c6(n))\n\nWe can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse of e modulo \u03c6(n):\n\n17*187 \u2261 1 (mod 3120)\nd \u2261 187 (mod 3120)\n\nThe public key is (n, e) = (3233, 17), and the private key is (n, d) = (3233, 187)."

            "1. Explanation:\n\nSymmetric key encryption is a type of encryption where the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. This means that the same key is used to scramble the plaintext message (making it unreadable) and to unscramble the ciphertext back to the original message.\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a classic example of a symmetric key encryption algorithm. It was invented by Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re in the 16th century and is still considered a popular and interesting encryption technique.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* The Vigen\u00e8re cipher uses a keyword (in this case, 'XMCKL') to determine the encryption and decryption process.\n* Each letter of the plaintext message is shifted by a certain number of positions, determined by the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n* The shift is calculated by finding the alphabetical position of the letter in the keyword and using it as the number of positions to shift the letter in the plaintext.\n* If the keyword is shorter than the plaintext, the cipher repeats the keyword to match the length of the plaintext.\n* The ciphertext is generated by shifting each letter of the plaintext according to the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n\nFor example, if the plaintext is 'HELLO' and the keyword is 'XMCKL', the Vigen\u00e8re cipher would shift each letter as follows:\n\n* H (8) + X (23) = 31 (which is equivalent to 1 in the alphabet, so the ciphertext is A)\n* E (5) + M (13) = 18 (which is equivalent to S in the alphabet)\n* L (12) + C (3) = 15 (which is equivalent to O in the alphabet)\n* L (12) + K (11) = 23 (which is equivalent to W in the alphabet)\n* O (15) + L (12) = 27 (which is equivalent to A in the alphabet)\n\nSo the ciphertext would be 'ASOWA'.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nTo encrypt the plaintext message 'HELLO' using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher with the keyword 'XMCKL', we will follow these steps:\n\n1. Write the plaintext message and the keyword side by side:\n\nH E L L O\nX M C K L\n\n2. Since the keyword is shorter than the plaintext, we will repeat it to match the length of the plaintext:\n\nH E L L O\nX M C K L X M C K\n\n3. Now, we will shift each letter of the plaintext according to the corresponding letter in the keyword:\n\nH (8) + X (23) = 31 (which is equivalent to 1 in the alphabet, so the ciphertext is A)\nE (5) + M (13) = 18 (which is equivalent to S in the alphabet)\nL (12) + C (3) = 15 (which is equivalent to O in the alphabet)\nL (12) + K (11) = 23 (which is equivalent to W in the alphabet)\nO (15) + L (12) = 27 (which is equivalent to A in the alphabet)\nL (12) + X (23) = 35 (which is equivalent to R in the alphabet)\nL (12) + M (13) = 25 (which is equivalent to Y in the alphabet)\nO (15) + C (3) = 18 (which is equivalent to S in the alphabet)\n\nSo the ciphertext is 'ASOWARYS'.\n\nAnswer: ASOWARYS",
            "1. Explanation: \nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. In the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, a keyword is used to determine the shift for each letter in the plaintext message. The keyword is repeated as necessary to match the length of the plaintext. Each letter of the plaintext is then shifted by the corresponding letter of the keyword, shifted by its alphabetical position in the keyword.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n- First, convert the plaintext to a series of numerical values based on the alphabetical position of each letter (A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25).\n- Next, convert the key to the same numerical system.\n- To encrypt, add the corresponding numerical values of the plaintext and the keyword together and take the modulus of the result by 26 to ensure the value stays within the 0-25 range.\n- The resulting numerical values represent the encrypted text.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\nGiven the plaintext message 'HELLO' and a key 'XMCKL', the first step is to convert the plaintext and the key to numerical values:\n\nPlaintext: H=7, E=4, L=11, L=11, O=14\nKey: X=23, M=12, C=2, K=10, L=11\n\nNext, we repeat the key to match the length of the plaintext by repeating the key: XMCKLXMCKL.\n\nNow, we perform the Vigen\u00e8re cipher encryption by adding the corresponding numerical values of the plaintext and the key together, and taking the modulus of the result by 26:\n\nH (7) + X (23) = 30 % 26 = 4\nE (4) + M (12) = 16 % 26 = 16\nL (11) + C (2) = 13 % 26 = 13\nL (11) + K (10) = 21 % 26 = 21\nO (14) + L (11) = 25 % 26 = 25\n\nThe encrypted message is: 4 16 13 21 25\n\nConverting the numerical values back to letters, the encrypted message is: UQSTZ",

In this case, we're using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift the plaintext letters. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which means that a different Caesar cipher is used for each letter of the plaintext based on the corresponding letter of the keyword.\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher uses a keyword to shift the plaintext letters. The keyword is repeated to match the length of the plaintext, and each letter of the keyword is used as an offset for the corresponding letter of the plaintext. The offset is determined by the position of the keyword letter in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.).\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a type of symmetric key encryption because the same keyword is used for both encryption and decryption. To decrypt the ciphertext, you would use the same keyword to shift the ciphertext letters back to their original positions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the Vigen\u00e8re cipher:\n\n- Take the plaintext message and the keyword.\n- Convert the keyword to a numerical sequence (A=0, B=1, C=2, etc.).\n- Repeat the numerical sequence to match the length of the plaintext.\n- Add the numerical sequence to the corresponding plaintext letters, taking into account the wraparound (0+26=26, 1+26=0, etc.).\n- Convert the resulting numerical sequence back to letters.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n \nGiven the plaintext message 'HELLO' and the key 'XMCKL', we will encrypt the message using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher.\n\nFirst, we convert the keyword to a numerical sequence:\n \nX -> 23\nM -> 12\nC -> 2\nK -> 10\nL -> 11\n\nSince the keyword is shorter than the plaintext, we repeat it to match the length of the plaintext:\n \n23 12 2 10 11 23 12 2 10 11\n\nNext, we convert the plaintext message to a numerical sequence:\n \nH -> 7\nE -> 4\nL -> 11\nL -> 11\nO -> 14\n\nWe add the numerical sequence to the corresponding plaintext letters, taking into account the wraparound:\n \n7 + 23 = 30 (30 % 26 = 4) = E\n4 + 12 = 16 (16 % 26 = 16) = Q (wraparound occurs)\n11 + 2 = 13 (13 % 26 = 13) = N\n11 + 10 = 21 (21 % 26 = 21) = V\n14 + 11 = 25 (25 % 26 = 25) = Z\n7 + 23 = 30 (30 % 26 = 4) = E\n4 + 12 = 16 (16 % 26 = 16) = Q (wraparound occurs)\n11 + 2 = 13 (13 % 26 = 13) = N\n14 + 10 = 24 (24 % 26 = 24) = Y\n11 + 11 = 22 (22 % 26 = 22) = W\n\nWe convert the resulting numerical sequence back to letters:\n \nE Q N V Z E Q N Y W\n\nThe encrypted message is: EQNVZEQNYW",
            "1. Explanation: Symmetric key encryption is a type of encryption where the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of the plaintext message. This means that the sender and the receiver must share the same key to ensure secure communication. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a specific type of symmetric key encryption that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher works by using a series of Caesar ciphers, where each letter of the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions based on the corresponding letter of the keyword. The number of positions is determined by the alphabetical position of the keyword letter, with A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on.\n\nFor example, if the keyword is 'XMCKL' and the plaintext is 'HELLO', the encryption process would work as follows:\n\n- H (8) + X (23) = 31 (mod 26) = 5 (since 31 mod 26 = 5)\n- E (4) + M (12) = 16 (mod 26) = 16\n- L (11) + C (2) = 13 (mod 26) = 13\n- L (11) + K (10) = 21 (mod 26) = 21\n- O (14) + L (11) = 25 (mod 26) = 25\n\nThe resulting ciphertext would be 'NQGNN'.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nGiven the plaintext message 'HELLO' and the key 'XMCKL', we can encrypt the message using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher as follows:\n\n1. Convert the plaintext message to alphabetical positions:\n   H = 8, E = 4, L = 11, L = 11, O = 14\n\n2. Convert the key to alphabetical positions:\n   X = 23, M = 12, C = 2, K = 10, L = 11\n\n3. Encrypt each letter of the plaintext by adding the corresponding letter of the key:\n   H (8) + X (23) = 31 (mod 26) = 5\n   E (4) + M (12) = 16 (mod 26) = 16\n   L (11) + C (2) = 13 (mod 26) = 13\n   L (11) + K (10) = 21 (mod 26) = 21\n   O (14) + L (11) = 25 (mod 26) = 25\n\n4. Convert the resulting alphabetical positions back to letters:\n   5 = N, 16 = Q, 13 = N, 21 = V, 25 = Y\n\nThe resulting ciphertext is 'NQNVY'.",
            "1. Explanation: Symmetric key encryption is a type of encryption where the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. This means that the same key is used to scramble the plaintext message to produce the ciphertext, and the same key is used to unscramble the ciphertext to recover the original plaintext. This type of encryption is also known as a \"shared secret\" or \"session key\" encryption.\n\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a specific type of symmetric key encryption that uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. In this cipher, each letter of the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet, depending on the corresponding letter in the keyword. The number of positions to shift is determined by the position of the letter in the alphabet of the keyword. The keyword is repeated as many times as necessary to match the length of the plaintext.\n\nFor example, if the keyword is 'KEY' and the plaintext is 'HELLO', the shifts for each letter would be K=11, E=4, Y=24, and so on. The shifted positions would be (11, 4, 24, 4) and the resulting ciphertext would be 'JGNSQ'.\n\nIn this explanation, I assume that the Vigen\u00e8re cipher is used with a keyword where each letter is shifted by the corresponding alphabetical position. In this case, the keyword 'XMCKL' has the shifts (23, 12, 3, 11).\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nTo encrypt the message 'HELLO' using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher with the keyword 'XMCKL', we perform the following steps:\n\n1. Convert each letter of the plaintext to its corresponding numerical value in the alphabet, where A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on. The plaintext message 'HELLO' becomes:\n\tH = 7\n\tE = 4\n\tL = 11\n\tL = 11\n\tO = 14\n\n2. Convert each letter of the keyword to its corresponding numerical value in the alphabet, where A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on. The keyword 'XMCKL' becomes:\n\tX = 23\n\tM = 12\n\tC = 3\n\tK = 11\n\tL = 11\n\n3. Since the keyword is shorter than the plaintext, repeat it to match the length of the plaintext:\nX = 23\nM = 12\nC = 3\nK = 11\n...\n[X = 23, M = 12, C = 3, K = 11, L = 11, X = 23, M = 12, C = 3, K = 11, L = 11]\n\n4. For each letter in the plaintext, add the corresponding shift value from the keyword to the plaintext letter value. If the result exceeds 25, subtract 26 to wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet. The results are:\n\t* H (7) + X (23) = 30, 30 - 26 = 4 -> 4\n\t* E (4) + M (12) = 16\n\t* L (11) + C (3) = 14\n\t* L (11) + K (11) = 22\n\t* O (14) + L (11) = 25, 25 - 26 = -1, -1 + 26 = 25\n\n5. Convert each result back to the corresponding letter of the alphabet, where A=0, B=1, C=2, and so on. The resulting ciphertext is:\n\t* 4 = E\n\t* 16 = Q\n\t* 14 = O\n\t* 22 = W\n\t* 25 = Z\n\nThe encrypted message is E Q O W Z.\n\nAnswer: EQOWZ"
