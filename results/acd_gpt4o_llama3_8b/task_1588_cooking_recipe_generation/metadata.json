They have shown strong capabilities in procedural knowledge and creativity. Therefore, the task of generating a low-sodium recipe using given ingredients, while moderately complex, is within the expected capabilities of an LLM. The use of an LLM judge in the evaluation process is also suitable, as it can effectively evaluate the generated responses based on the predefined criteria.\n\nThe LLM's success at this task is not particularly surprising or noteworthy to an expert in the field, given the current state of technology.\n\nDecision: No"
