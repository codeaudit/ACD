            "Response: Upon arriving at the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, I take a moment to observe the serene surroundings and mentally prepare myself for the experience. I carefully remove my shoes and don the provided slippers, making sure to tie them securely to avoid any noise. As I enter the room, I bow slightly upon greeting the host, using a gentle and respectful bow, known as \"keirei,\" to show my appreciation for their hospitality.\n\nUpon entering the tearoom, I take a seat on the tatami mat, facing the tokonoma, the alcove that displays a beautiful piece of art or nature. I make sure to sit with my legs crossed, keeping my back straight and my hands visible, as a sign of respect. The host, dressed in traditional kimono, greets me with a warm smile and a gentle bow, inviting me to participate in the ceremony.\n\nAs the host prepares the tea, I take the opportunity to observe the intricate process and appreciate the attention to detail. I watch as they carefully select the tea leaves, prepare the water, and heat the tea kettle over an open flame. The aroma of the tea wafts through the air, and I take a deep breath, savoring the scent.\n\nWhen the host offers me the tea, I accept it with a gentle \"arigatou\" (thank you), and carefully take the cup from the host.

I would avoid revealing or flashy clothing that might be considered offensive.\n\nWhen attending an Indian wedding, it's customary to bring gifts, known as 'shagun,' to the hosts. These gifts can be cash, gold jewelry, or other items like clothing, kitchen utensils, or decorative items. It's essential to check with the hosts or the wedding invitation to see if there are any specific gifts they would like or prefer not to receive.\n\nUpon arrival, I would greet the hosts with a namaste (a slight bow with my hands together) and a warm 'Ram Ram' or 'Namaste.' It's customary to remove your shoes before entering the house or the wedding reception area.\n\nDuring the wedding ceremonies, I would be mindful of the seating arrangements and follow the lead of the hosts or the wedding party. In a traditional Indian wedding, the seating arrangements are usually determined based on the social hierarchy and the family's status. I would avoid sitting in the center or near the family members who are considered higher in status.\n\nWhen interacting with other guests, I would be respectful and courteous, using phrases like 'didi' (aunt) or 'chachu' (uncle) to address older individuals. I would also avoid eating with my left hand, as the left hand is considered impolite in Indian culture. I would also be mindful of my food choices, avoiding beef or other non-vegetarian options that might not be suitable for the occasion.\n\nDuring the ceremonies, I would participate by clapping or cheering at specific moments, such as when the bride and groom exchange garlands or take their first steps together. I would also be respectful during the more solemn moments, such as when the couple is taking their wedding vows.\n\nTo show respect for Indian traditions, I would also be mindful of the timing and duration of my stay. Indian weddings often go late into the night, and it's customary to stay until the end of the celebrations. I would also avoid leaving the wedding area without permission from the hosts, as this might be considered impolite.\n\nOverall, attending an Indian wedding requires a deep understanding of the cultural norms and sensitivities involved. By dressing modestly, bringing respectful gifts, and behaving courteously, I can show my appreciation for the hosts and their traditions.",
            "Response: As a guest at an Indian wedding, I would dress modestly and respectfully, avoiding revealing or flashy clothing. I would opt for traditional Indian attire such as a salwar kameez or a saree, or dress in a formal outfit that is not too casual. I would also make sure to remove my shoes before entering the house or the mandap (wedding pavilion), as is customary in many Indian households.\n\nWhen greeting the hosts, I would use the traditional Indian greeting of \"Namaste\" or \"Namaskar\" with a slight bow of the head, as a sign of respect. I would also bring gifts that are culturally significant and appreciated, such as a box of sweets, a bottle of fine wine, or a traditional Indian handicraft. It's also customary to bring gifts for the couple, such as a set of fine china or a decorative item for their new home.\n\nDuring the ceremonies, I would participate by following the lead of the other guests and the wedding party. I would also be mindful of the customs and traditions surrounding the specific ceremonies, such as the haldi ceremony, the mehndi ceremony, and the pheras (wedding rituals). For example, during the pheras, I would join in by walking around the fire with the couple, and making a wish for their happiness and prosperity.\n\nWhen interacting with other guests, I would be respectful and courteous, using formal titles such as \"ji\" or \"sahib\" when addressing elders or those in positions of authority. I would also be mindful of the cultural norms around physical touch and personal space, avoiding physical contact or overly familiar behavior. I would also be prepared to engage in lively and respectful conversation, using polite language and avoiding sensitive topics.\n\nThroughout the wedding, I would be mindful of the customs and traditions surrounding food and drink, such as eating with the right hand and not touching the host's plate or utensils. I would also be prepared to try new foods and drinks, and to show appreciation for the hospitality and generosity of the hosts.\n\nOverall, my goal would be to be respectful, courteous, and considerate of the cultural norms and traditions surrounding the Indian wedding. By doing so, I would be able to participate fully and enjoy the celebration, while also showing my appreciation for the rich cultural heritage of India."

These models have shown proficiency in generating contextually relevant and culturally informed responses, especially when provided with clear instructions and criteria.\n\nThus, the agent's success at this task is noteworthy but not surprising to an expert in the field of LLMs.\n\n**Decision: No**"
