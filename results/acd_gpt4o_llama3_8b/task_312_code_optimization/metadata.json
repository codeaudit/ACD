They can often refactor code for better performance, especially when common inefficiencies such as nested loops or suboptimal algorithms are present.\n\n1. **Task Family Reasoning**:\n   - **Coding Skills**: LLMs are generally good at understanding and generating code snippets.\n   - **Efficiency and Optimization**: While more challenging, LLMs, especially those trained on large code corpora, can often suggest more efficient algorithms or data structures.\n   - **Human Difficulty**: The task is difficult for humans, but LLMs have shown proficiency in similar tasks.\n\n2. **Task Specifics**:\n   - The example provided in the task involves optimizing a function that identifies duplicates in a list, which can be improved using a set for O(n) complexity.\n   - The automated scoring uses `eval_with_llm_judge`, which evaluates the logical correctness and performance improvement.\n\nGiven this context, the success of the LLM in optimizing the code for better performance is not particularly surprising.
