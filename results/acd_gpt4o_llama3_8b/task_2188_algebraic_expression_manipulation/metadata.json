            "To solve this problem, I'll first need to generate a non-trivial quadratic equation with integer coefficients, ensuring that the roots are real numbers and the equation is not a perfect square. Here's how I'll approach this:\n\n## Step 1: Understand the general form of a quadratic equation\nA quadratic equation is in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a \u2260 0. For the roots to be real and the equation not to be a perfect square, I'll need to choose a and c in such a way that the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is not a perfect square and is greater than or equal to 0.\n\n## Step 2: Choose coefficients a, b, and c\nTo ensure the equation is not a perfect square and has real roots, I'll select a = 1 to keep the equation as simple as possible, and c = 6 for one of the roots to be a rational number (in this case, c = 6 will help in getting an integer root). Then, I'll calculate b such that the discriminant is not a perfect square but its square root is an integer.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate b\nFor the discriminant b^2 - 4ac to be greater than 0 to ensure real roots, I'll pick b so that b^2 - 24 is a non-perfect square that is greater than 0.\n\n## Step 4: Select a non-perfect square\nLet's choose b^2 - 24 = 32, which is a non-perfect square since 32 is not a perfect square. So, we have b^2 = 56.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate b\nSince b^2 = 56, we need to find the square root of 56, which is approximately 7.48, but I need an integer value for b to keep the equation simple and ensure integer roots. However, I'll reconsider my approach to simplify the calculation and make it more straightforward to find integer values.\n\n## Step 6: Reconsider b value\nGiven the error in my previous step, let's reconsider and simplify the process. To find an easy integer value for b, I'll choose b in a way that its square plus 24 results in a non-perfect square that is greater than zero and easy to solve. For instance, if I consider a different value of c, I can make the discriminant calculation simpler and get integer roots.\n\n## Step 7: Choose c to simplify b^2 - 4ac\nSince we are looking for a non-trivial quadratic equation and we want integer coefficients, let's simplify the problem by selecting c such that it makes the calculation of b easier and gives integer roots. We can choose c = 2 to make the equation and its solution straightforward.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate b with the new c value\nWith c = 2, we have b^2 - 8 = 32, which means b^2 = 40. However, this approach also does not provide an easy solution for b as a perfect square.\n\n## Step 9: Reconsider choosing c and b\nLet's take a different approach to select c and b such that it simplifies the calculation. I will choose c = 4 for simplicity and ensure the roots are integers.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate b\nWith c = 4, we have b^2 - 16 = 32. So, b^2 = 48, which is not an easy number to simplify, so let's re-evaluate.\n\n## Step 11: Reconsider c to simplify b^2 - 4ac\nLet's try choosing a = 1, c = 8. Then, b^2 - 32 = 40. So, b^2 = 72.\n\n## Step 12: Solve for b\nb^2 = 72, but this is not a perfect square. Let's try to simplify the problem and make it easier.\n\n## Step 13: Choose a, b, and c for a simpler equation\nLet's choose c = 4 and a = 1. Then we need to find an integer b that satisfies the equation b^2 - 16 = 32.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for b\nHowever, the previous step is incorrect because we are trying to solve for b but we already have an equation with b^2 on one side. Let's reconsider and pick c = 8 and a = 1, then we will have b^2 - 32 = 40.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for b\nThis approach does not provide a straightforward integer value for b. Let's simplify the problem by making it easier to calculate b and get integer roots.\n\n## Step 16: Choose a, b, and c for a simpler equation and solution\nFor simplicity, let's select a = 1, c = 4, then we have b^2 - 16 = 32.\n\n## Step 17: Solve for b\nHowever, let's correct the previous step and pick a = 1, c = 4, and b = 6 to make the equation easier to solve.\n\n## Step 18: Write the quadratic equation\nThe equation with a = 1, b = 6, and c = 4 is x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0.\n\n## Step 19: Solve the quadratic equation\nTo solve the equation x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n\n## Step 20: Apply the quadratic formula\nSubstituting the values a = 1, b = 6, and c = 4 into the quadratic formula, we get x = (-6 \u00b1 \u221a(6^2 - 4*1*4)) / 2*1.\n\n## Step 21: Simplify the quadratic formula\nx = (-6 \u00b1 \u221a(36 - 16)) / 2.\n\n## Step 22: Simplify the expression inside the square root\nx = (-6 \u00b1 \u221a20) / 2.\n\n## Step 23: Simplify the square root of 20\nx = (-6 \u00b1 2\u221a5) / 2.\n\n## Step 24: Simplify the expression\nx = (-6 \u00b1 2\u221a5) / 2 = -3 \u00b1 \u221a5.\n\nThe final answer is: \nAnswer: Expression: x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0, Solution: x = -3 \u00b1 \u221a5.",

Therefore, the equation is a non-trivial quadratic equation with real roots.\n\nNow, let's solve the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 for its roots.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nSubstituting the values a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6:\n\nx = (-(5) \u00b1 sqrt(1)) / 2(1)\nx = (-5 \u00b1 1) / 2\n\nNow, let's calculate the two roots:\n\nx1 = (-5 + 1) / 2\n= -4 / 2\n= -2\n\nx2 = (-5 - 1) / 2\n= -6 / 2\n= -3\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are x = -2 and x = -3.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\nExpression: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\nSolution: x = -2, x = -3"

            "To create a system of linear equations with two variables that has a unique solution, we need to ensure that the system is not inconsistent (i.e., it does not have no solution) or dependent (i.e., it has infinitely many solutions). This means that the two equations must be linearly independent, which can be achieved by ensuring that the coefficients of the variables are not proportional.\n\nHere's a plan to generate such a system:\n\n1. **Choose two variables**: Let's choose x and y as our variables.\n2. **Create two equations**: We need two equations with x and y as the variables. To ensure they are linearly independent, let's make the coefficients of x and y different in each equation.\n3. **Ensure the system has a unique solution**: To guarantee a unique solution, the system must not be inconsistent or dependent. This means the two equations must not be parallel (i.e., their slopes are different) and they must not represent the same line (i.e., their intercepts are different).\n\nBased on the above plan, here's a system of linear equations with two variables that has a unique solution:\n\nExpression: \n2x + 3y = 7\nx - 2y = -3\n\nTo solve the system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the method of elimination:\n\nTo eliminate one of the variables, we can multiply the two equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of either x or y are the same in both equations but with opposite signs. Let's eliminate x. Multiply the first equation by 1 and the second equation by 2, so that the coefficients of x in both equations are the same (2x in the first equation and 2x in the second equation):\n\n2x + 3y = 7\n2x - 4y = -6\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x:\n\n(2x + 3y) - (2x - 4y) = 7 - (-6)\nCombine like terms:\n7y = 13\n\nNow, divide by 7 to solve for y:\ny = 13/7\n\nNow, substitute the value of y back into one of the original equations to solve for x. Let's use the first equation:\n2x + 3(13/7) = 7\n\nMultiply 3 by 13/7:\n2x + 39/7 = 7\n\nMultiply both sides by 7 to get rid of the fraction:\n14x + 39 = 49\n\nSubtract 39 from both sides:\n14x = 10\n\nDivide both sides by 14:\nx = 10/14\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\nx = 5/7\n\nTherefore, the unique solution to the system of linear equations is x = 5/7 and y = 13/7.\n\nAnswer: x = 5/7, y = 13/7",

This will allow me to eliminate the y variable.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 yields: 4x + 6y = 14\n\nMultiplying the second equation by 3 yields: 12x - 6y = 3\n\nNow, I can add the two equations to eliminate the y variable: (4x + 6y) + (12x - 6y) = 14 + 3\n\nSimplifying the equation, I get: 16x = 17\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 16, I get: x = 17/16\n\nNow that I have the value of x, I can substitute it into one of the original equations to solve for y.\n\nSubstituting x = 17/16 into the first equation, I get: 2(17/16) + 3y = 7\n\nMultiplying 2 by 17/16, I get: 17/8 + 3y = 7\n\nSubtracting 17/8 from both sides, I get: 3y = 7 - 17/8\n\nTo subtract 17/8 from 7, I need to find a common denominator, which is 8. So, I'll convert 7 to 56/8: 3y = 56/8 - 17/8\n\nCombining the fractions, I get: 3y = 39/8\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, I get: y = 39/24\n\nSimplifying the fraction, I get: y = 13/8\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = 17/16 and y = 13/8.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested format:\n\nExpression: 2x + 3y = 7, 4x - 2y = 1\nSolution: x = 17/16, y = 13/8",
