Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nR(x) = C(x)\n\nwhere R(x) is the revenue function and C(x) is the cost function.\n\nGiven the cost function C(x) = 50x + 2000 and the revenue function R(x) = 100x, we can set up the equation:\n\n100x = 50x + 2000\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n100x - 50x = 2000\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n50x = 2000\n\nDividing both sides by 50, we get:\n\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, the company needs to sell 40 widgets to break even.\n\nTo calculate the break-even point, we need to find the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost. We can do this by finding the point at which the profit function is equal to zero.\n\nThe profit function is given by:\n\nP(x) = R(x) - C(x)\n\nSubstituting the given functions, we get:\n\nP(x) = 100x - (50x + 2000)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nP(x) = 50x - 2000\n\nTo find the break-even point, we set P(x) = 0 and solve for x:\n\n50x - 2000 = 0\n\nAdding 2000 to both sides, we get:\n\n50x = 2000\n\nDividing both sides by 50, we get:\n\nx = 40\n\nTherefore, the break-even point is x = 40 widgets.\n\nAnswer: 40",
