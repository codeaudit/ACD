Let's break down the considerations step-by-step:\n\n1. **Capabilities of LLMs**: Modern large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a strong ability to handle mathematical reasoning and problem-solving tasks, particularly when the problems are well-defined and follow a standard formula. The factorial calculation for permutations and the combination formula are straightforward for such models, provided they understand the instructions clearly.\n\n2. **Task Description and Instructions**: The instructions provided are clear and detailed. They outline the steps needed to solve the problem, including the relevant formulas. This makes it easier for the LLM to follow the instructions and arrive at the correct solution.\n\n3. **Task Difficulty**: The task is described as having a moderate difficulty level for humans. Given that LLMs are trained on large datasets that likely include similar problems, solving this type of problem is within their expected capabilities.\n\n4. **Scoring Method**: The task uses an LLM judge (`eval_with_llm_judge`) to evaluate the correctness of the response. This method can be appropriate as long as the LLM judge accurately understands and applies the validation criteria.\n\nGiven these considerations, the LLM succeeding at solving a combinatorial problem involving permutations is not surprising. It aligns with the known capabilities of LLMs in handling mathematical reasoning tasks.\n\nDecision: No"
