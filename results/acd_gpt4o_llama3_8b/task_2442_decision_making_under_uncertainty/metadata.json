            "I recommend investing in Option B, which offers a higher expected value and a lower risk of loss.",
            "- Analysis: The key factors involved in this scenario are the two potential software development projects, their respective probabilities of success, and the associated profits and losses. Additionally, the company's current financial stability and market position play a crucial role in determining the risk tolerance and expected profit. The two projects have different risk profiles, with Project A offering a higher potential profit but also a higher risk of loss, while Project B has a lower potential profit but a lower risk of loss.\n\n- Evaluation: To evaluate the possible outcomes, we can calculate the expected profit for each project. For Project A, the expected profit is (0.6 x $1,000,000) + (0.4 x -$500,000) = $600,000 - $200,000 = $400,000. For Project B, the expected profit is (0.9 x $500,000) = $450,000.\n\n- Decision and Justification: Based on the goal of maximizing the expected profit while considering the company's risk tolerance, I recommend choosing Project B. Although Project A has a higher potential profit, the risk of loss is too high, which could negatively impact the company's financial stability and market position. Project B, on the other hand, offers a more stable and predictable outcome, which aligns with the company's risk tolerance.\n\n- Counterarguments: One potential counterargument is that the company should take on the higher-risk project to maximize potential profits. However, this approach could lead to financial instability and damage to the company's reputation if the project fails. Another counterargument is that the company should diversify its investments by pursuing both projects. While diversification can be a good strategy, it may not be feasible in this scenario due to limited resources and the high risk associated with Project A.",
            "I recommend investing in the second project with a 90% chance of success and a profit of $500,000, as it offers a higher expected profit and lower risk of loss compared to the first project.",
            "I should invest in the first project because it has a higher expected profit of $500,000, but I should also carefully consider the company's risk tolerance and financial stability before making the final decision.",
            "- Analysis: The scenario involves two software development projects with different probabilities of success and potential profits/losses. The key factors involved are the project's success rates (60% and 90%), the corresponding profits and losses, and the company's risk tolerance. Additionally, the company's current financial stability and market position play a crucial role in determining the optimal investment decision.\n\n- Evaluation: To evaluate the possible outcomes, we can calculate the expected profit for each project. For Project A, the expected profit is (0.6 * $1,000,000) + (0.4 * -$500,000) = $600,000 - $200,000 = $400,000. For Project B, the expected profit is (0.9 * $500,000) + (0.1 * $0) = $450,000.\n\n- Decision and Justification: Based on the expected profit calculations, Project B appears to be the more attractive option, with an expected profit of $450,000 compared to Project A's $400,000. Considering the company's risk tolerance, the higher probability of success for Project B (90%) suggests that it is a safer bet. Additionally, the company's current financial stability and market position may benefit from the lower-risk investment.\n\n- Counterarguments: A potential counterargument is that the higher potential profit of Project A ($1,000,000) might be worth the increased risk. However, this would require a more aggressive risk tolerance and a willingness to accept the potential loss of $500,000. Another counterargument is that Project B's lower profit ($500,000) might not be sufficient to justify the investment, especially if the company has other pressing financial needs. Nevertheless, the expected profit and risk considerations suggest that Project B is the more suitable option."

Additionally, we need to consider the company's current financial stability and market position, which may influence the level of risk tolerance.\n\nEvaluation: \nTo evaluate the possible outcomes, we can calculate the expected value (EV) for each option. The EV is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its respective value and summing the results.\n\nFor Option A:\nEV = (0.6 x $1,000,000) + (0.4 x -$500,000) = $600,000 - $200,000 = $400,000\n\nFor Option B:\nEV = (0.9 x $500,000) + (0.1 x $0) = $450,000\n\nBased on the expected values, Option B seems to be the better choice, as it has a higher expected value.\n\nDecision and Justification: \nBased on the evaluation, I recommend investing in Option B, which has a higher expected value and a lower risk of loss. This decision is justified because it aligns with the goal of maximizing the expected profit while considering the company's risk tolerance. The company can afford to take on more risk and invest in a project with a higher potential return, as the expected value is higher and the risk of loss is lower.\n\nCounterarguments: \nOne potential counterargument is that the company may not want to invest in a project with a lower profit margin, as it may not be as impactful or influential in the market. However, this can be addressed by considering the company's current financial stability and market position. If the company has a strong financial foundation, it may be able to afford to take on more risk and invest in a project with a higher expected return. Another potential counterargument is that the company may not want to invest in a project with a high probability of success but a lower profit margin, as it may not be as rewarding.

On the other hand, improving existing health services guarantees an immediate improvement in the quality of life for hundreds of patients, but it may not have the same long-term impact as finding a cure for a rare disease.\n\nEvaluation: \nIf the new medical research project is successful, it could lead to the development of a cure for a rare disease, potentially saving thousands of lives in the long term. The probability of success is 70%, which is a significant chance of achieving this outcome. In contrast, improving existing health services guarantees an improvement in the quality of life for hundreds of patients, but it does not offer the same potential for saving lives in the long term. However, it is a more certain outcome, with no potential downside.\n\nDecision and Justification: \nBased on the goal of maximizing overall health benefits while considering long-term impacts and public perception, I would recommend investing in the new medical research project. The potential long-term benefits of finding a cure for a rare disease outweigh the guaranteed improvement in quality of life for existing patients. Although the risk of not finding a cure is 30%, the potential reward is significant and could have a profound impact on public perception and the overall health of the community. Additionally, the research project may lead to new discoveries and advancements in medicine that could benefit a wide range of patients in the long term.\n\nCounterarguments: \nA potential counterargument to this decision is that investing in the research project may not lead to the expected outcome, and the money would be wasted. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that the project has a 70% chance of success, and the potential reward is significant. Another counterargument is that improving existing health services is a more certain and immediate way to improve the quality of life for patients. However, this approach may not have the same long-term impact as finding a cure for a rare disease, and may not be as effective in reducing healthcare costs and improving overall health outcomes in the long term."

It must analyze scenarios, evaluate probabilities, make decisions, and address counterarguments.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is described as difficult for humans, implying it requires a high level of cognitive function, including understanding probabilities, risk assessment, and making nuanced judgments.\n\n3. **LLM Capabilities**: While LLMs are known for their ability to process and generate natural language, reasoning under uncertainty and making decisions based on probabilistic outcomes is a more advanced capability. It involves not just understanding text but also applying logical and mathematical reasoning.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The task is scored using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which evaluates the response based on specific criteria. The criteria are well-defined and focus on the accuracy of analysis, evaluation, decision-making, justification, and counterarguments.\n\nGiven these points, the success of an LLM on this task is particularly noteworthy for several reasons:\n- **Advanced Reasoning Required**: The task demands a high level of reasoning and decision-making ability, which goes beyond simple text generation.\n- **Probabilistic Thinking**: Successfully handling the probabilities and making a reasoned decision considering risk and reward is non-trivial.\n- **Evaluation Criteria**: The criteria require a comprehensive and coherent response, indicating that the LLM must deeply understand the scenario and goal to succeed.\n\nThus, the success of the LLM on this task indicates a significant advancement in its reasoning and decision-making capabilities, making it surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
