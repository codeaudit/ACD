            "Problem: In triangle ABC, side AB has a length of 3 units, side BC has a length of 4 units, and side AC has a length of 5 units. Find the area and the angles of the triangle.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angles, and then use the formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nStep 1: Use the Law of Cosines to find one of the angles.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\ncos(C) = (3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 - 5\u00b2) / (2 * 3 * 4)\ncos(C) = (9 + 16 - 25) / 24\ncos(C) = -0 / 24\ncos(C) = 0\n\nHowever, since the cosine of an angle cannot be 0, we realize that we cannot use this method to find angle C directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the given sides 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple, which means that the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle opposite the side of length 5.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the triangle.\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a right triangle:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base and height are 3 and 4, respectively, so the area is:\n\nArea = (3 * 4) / 2\nArea = 12 / 2\nArea = 6\n\nStep 3: Find the other two angles of the triangle.\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, we know that one of the angles is 90 degrees. We can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees to find the other two angles:\n\nAngle A + Angle B + 90 = 180\nAngle A + Angle B = 90\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, we can use the fact that the sine and cosine of the acute angles are related by the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin\u00b2(A) + cos\u00b2(A) = 1\n\nWe can use the fact that sin(A) = 3/5 and cos(A) = 4/5 to find the measure of angle A:\n\nsin(A) = 3/5\ncos(A) = 4/5\n\nUsing the inverse tangent function, we can find the measure of angle A:\n\nA = arctan(3/4)\nA \u2248 36.87\u00b0\n\nSince Angle A + Angle B = 90, we can find the measure of Angle B:\n\nB = 90 - A\nB \u2248 90 - 36.87\nB \u2248 53.13\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 6 square units, and the angles of the triangle are approximately 36.87\u00b0, 53.13\u00b0, and 90\u00b0.",

Find the area of the circle and the area of the square that is not covered by the circle.\n\nSolution: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the area of the circle and the area of the square that is not covered by the circle.\n\nStep 1: Find the radius of the circle.\n\nSince the circle is inscribed within the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 10 units. \n\nThe radius is half the diameter.

            "Problem: In triangle ABC, side AB has a length of 3 units, side BC has a length of 4 units, and side AC has a length of 5 units. Find the area and the angles of the triangle.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angles, and then use the formula for the area of a triangle.\n\nStep 1: Use the Law of Cosines to find one of the angles.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for cos(C):\n\ncos(C) = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) / (2ab)\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\ncos(C) = (3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 - 5\u00b2) / (2 * 3 * 4)\ncos(C) = (9 + 16 - 25) / 24\ncos(C) = -0 / 24\ncos(C) = 0\n\nHowever, since the cosine of an angle cannot be 0, we realize that we cannot use this method to find angle C directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the given sides 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triple, which means that the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle opposite the side of length 5.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the triangle.\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a right triangle:\n\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n\nIn this case, the base and height are 3 and 4, respectively, so the area is:\n\nArea = (3 * 4) / 2\nArea = 12 / 2\nArea = 6\n\nStep 3: Find the other two angles of the triangle.\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, we know that one of the angles is 90 degrees. We can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees to find the other two angles:\n\nAngle A + Angle B + 90 = 180\nAngle A + Angle B = 90\n\nSince the triangle is a right triangle, we can use the fact that the sine and cosine of the acute angles are related by the Pythagorean identity:\n\nsin\u00b2(A) + cos\u00b2(A) = 1\n\nWe can use the fact that sin(A) = 3/5 and cos(A) = 4/5 to find the measure of angle A:\n\nsin(A) = 3/5\ncos(A) = 4/5\n\nUsing the inverse tangent function, we can find the measure of angle A:\n\nA = arctan(3/4)\nA \u2248 36.87\u00b0\n\nSince Angle A + Angle B = 90, we can find the measure of Angle B:\n\nB = 90 - A\nB \u2248 90 - 36.87\nB \u2248 53.13\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 6 square units, and the angles of the triangle are approximately 36.87\u00b0, 53.13\u00b0, and 90\u00b0.",

Using this information, calculate the area and angles of the triangle.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nStep 1: Determine if the triangle is a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

            "content": "Given the description of the task family and the capabilities of contemporary large language models (LLMs):\n\n1. **Task Description and Complexity**: The task involves generating and solving geometric problems, which requires mathematical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and a good understanding of geometry. The example provided is a classic problem involving a right triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5, where the area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, and the angles can be determined using trigonometric relationships.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: LLMs have shown proficiency in handling mathematical problems, including geometry, provided the problems are within the scope of high school or early college-level mathematics. They can follow step-by-step procedures and apply formulas, which is essential for this task.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated using an LLM judge, which assesses whether the generated problem reflects the given criteria, includes all necessary steps and calculations, is logically consistent and mathematically correct, and follows the given format.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The problem is considered difficult for humans, but for an LLM, it is within the range of tasks they are expected to handle well, especially if they have been trained on a diverse dataset that includes mathematical problem-solving.\n\n5. **Agent Performance**: The agent succeeded at the task, meaning it correctly generated a problem and provided a detailed, logically consistent solution that met all criteria.\n\n**Decision**: No\n\nReasoning: Given the capabilities of current LLMs in handling mathematical and geometric problems, the success of the agent in this task is not surprising. LLMs are known to perform well on structured mathematical problems that involve applying known formulas and logical reasoning."
