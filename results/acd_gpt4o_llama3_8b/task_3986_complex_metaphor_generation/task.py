Concept 1: {t['concept1']}
Concept 2: {t['concept2']}

Provide a detailed explanation of the metaphor, illustrating the deep connection between the two concepts. Ensure your metaphor is creative, coherent, and well-articulated. Here are some guidelines to help you:

1. Originality: The metaphor should present a fresh and unique perspective, avoiding clichÃ©s.
2. Depth: The connection between the concepts should be profound, offering new insights or perspectives.
3. Clarity: The explanation should be clear, thorough, and logically coherent.
4. Relevance: Ensure the metaphor and explanation are directly related to the given concepts.

Submit your response as a plain text string in the following format:

Metaphor: [Your metaphor]
Explanation: [Your explanation]"""
