This capability can be assessed through tasks that require the model to solve problems using different approaches or perspectives.\n\nA suitable task family for this could involve solving the same type of problem (e.g., a puzzle or a logical problem) but requiring different solution strategies. For instance, one task might ask for a direct logical solution, while another might require approaching the problem from a creative or lateral thinking perspective.

They may struggle with tasks that require out-of-the-box thinking or novel solutions that are less likely to be found in their training data.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**:\n    - The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for evaluation is generally suitable for logical and well-defined tasks. However, it may have limitations in accurately assessing creative and lateral thinking solutions, as these are inherently more subjective.\n\n4. **Task Difficulty**:\n    - The task difficulty is rated as difficult for humans, implying that a successful solution requires a good understanding of the problem and a clear, logical approach to solving it.\n\nGiven these points, the success of an LLM on such tasks is not particularly surprising due to their ability to leverage extensive training data on similar logical problems. However, if the LLM successfully demonstrates creative problem-solving and lateral thinking, it might be noteworthy, as this is an area where LLMs typically show varied performance.\n\n**Decision: No**"
