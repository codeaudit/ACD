In the distance, the lighthouse stood sentinel, perched atop a rocky outcrop, its light beginning to pierce the darkening sky like a beacon of hope. As night began to descend, the lighthouse's glow grew stronger, casting a warm, comforting light across the beach, a constant reassurance that guidance and safety were near. The couple, lost in their own little world, continued their leisurely stroll, the gentle rhythm of the waves and the soft glow of the lighthouse a perfect accompaniment to their romantic evening stroll."
