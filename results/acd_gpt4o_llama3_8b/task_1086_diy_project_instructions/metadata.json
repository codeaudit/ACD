A double boiler setup is necessary to prevent the wax from burning or getting too hot. Ensure that the water level in the bottom pot is below the bottom of the top pot to prevent water from entering the top pot.\n\nStep 4: Place the double boiler on the stovetop over low heat and heat the wax until it reaches a temperature of around 180-190\u00b0F (82-88\u00b0C) as monitored using the thermometer. Stir occasionally to ensure even heating.\n\nStep 5: Once the wax has reached the desired temperature, remove the top pot from the heat and add the dye to the melted wax. Stir thoroughly until the color is evenly distributed throughout.\n\nStep 6: Add the essential oils to the melted wax and mix well. Use a few drops at a time, as too much can result in an overpowering scent.\n\nStep 7: Prepare the mold by making sure it is clean and dry. If using a silicone mold, lightly spray it with cooking spray to ensure easy release.\n\nStep 8: Pour the melted wax mixture into the prepared mold, making sure to fill it to the top. Use a spatula or spoon to remove any air bubbles that form.\n\nStep 9: Allow the wax to cool and solidify completely. This can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the size of the candle.\n\nStep 10: Once the wax is solid, remove it from the mold by gently twisting and pulling it out. Trim the wick to the desired length.\n\nStep 11: Your homemade candle is now ready for use. Light it and enjoy the pleasant scent and ambiance it provides.",
