This isn't because they're physically connected by a string or a wire, but because they've been practicing together for so long that they've developed a synchronized sense of movement. If Alice twirls to the left, Bob will instinctively twirl to the left as well, even if they're on opposite sides of the stage.

If Alice spins around, Bob will instantly know to spin around too, even if he's on the other side of the stage. This is because their earpieces are \"entangled\" in a way that lets them communicate instantly, without needing any physical connection. Similarly, in quantum entanglement, two particles can become connected in a way that lets them affect each other's state instantly, even if they're separated by large distances.",

Similarly, in quantum entanglement, two particles are connected in such a way that their properties are \"entangled\" \u2013 when one particle is in a certain state, the other particle instantly reflects that state, regardless of the distance between them.

But instead of keeping the notebook themselves, each friend makes a copy of the paper and sends it to all the other friends. \n\nNow, when a friend wants to add a new trade to the notebook, they don't just write it down on a new piece of paper - they also have to get agreement from a majority of the friends that the trade is legitimate. Once everyone agrees, they each update their copy of the notebook to include the new trade. \n\nThe really cool thing about this notebook is that it's almost impossible for someone to cheat and alter the trades that have already been recorded, because each friend has a copy of the entire notebook and can see that the trades have been verified by the group.

            "Analogy: Think of two dancers, Alice and Bob, performing a choreographed dance routine. Whenever Alice twirls her partner, Bob instantly twirls his partner on the other side of the stage, even if they're separated by a long distance. This isn't because they're physically connected by a string or a wire, but because they've been practicing together for so long that they've developed a synchronized sense of movement. If Alice twirls to the left, Bob will instinctively twirl to the left as well, even if they're on opposite sides of the stage. This is similar to quantum entanglement, where two particles are connected in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, even if they're separated by large distances.",

If Alice spins around, Bob will instantly know to spin around too, even if he's on the other side of the stage. This is because their earpieces are \"entangled\" in a way that lets them communicate instantly, without needing any physical connection. Similarly, in quantum entanglement, two particles can become connected in a way that lets them affect each other's state instantly, even if they're separated by large distances.",

When one dancer moves their arm up, the other dancer instantly moves their arm up as well, even if they're on opposite sides of the stage.

Similarly, in quantum entanglement, two particles are connected in such a way that their properties are \"entangled\" \u2013 when one particle is in a certain state, the other particle instantly reflects that state, regardless of the distance between them.

            "Analogy: Imagine two dancers, Alice and Bob, who are connected by a special kind of invisible string.

This happens not because they're physically connected by a rope, but because they're both wearing special shoes that are \"entangled\" in a way that lets them sense each other's movements. So, when Alice twirls, Bob's shoes send a signal to him that makes him twirl too, even if he's far away. It's like they're \"talking\" to each other in a way that's faster than the speed of sound, and it happens no matter how far apart they are.
