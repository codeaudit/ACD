We can see that the number 4 is already present in row 2, so we are left with numbers 1, 2, and the blank space. However, we have already placed the number 1 in row 1, the number 2 in row 3, and the number 4 in column 2. This means that the number 1 cannot be placed in this column. We can place the number 3 in the blank space in column 3.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 |   | 4 |   |\n| 2 | 4 |   | 2 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, we have filled in all the missing numbers in the grid.\n\nFor Task 1, the solution is:\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 |   |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 2 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nHowever, it appears that the previous solution is incorrect based on the task description.\nCorrecting this to follow the task description:\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 |   |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 2 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nBut to follow the task description, the missing number should be 3 in the place marked '   ' in the second row.\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 |  |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 2 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nSince the number 2 is already present in the last column, 3 should be in the place marked '   ' in the second row.\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 2 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nHowever, we can't have a duplicate number in the grid.\nThus, the correct solution following the task description:\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 |  |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 |  |\n| 4 |  | 2 | 1 |\n\nBut, we can't have a blank space in our answer. Since, the number 2 is already in the last column, we should place a 3 or a 1 in the fourth row in the second column and place a 1 or 3 in the second row in the fourth column.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 | 1 |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, we have filled in all the missing numbers in the grid.\n\nFor Task 2, the solution is:\nA-1, B-2, C-3, D-4, E-1, F-3, G-4, H-2, I-4, J-1, K-3, L-2"

Since 1, 2, and 4 are already present in the first row, the missing number must be 3. So, the first row is | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |.\n\nStep 2: Look at the third column and the first row to confirm that the number 3 is correct. Now, the third column will have 3 in the first row and the number 4 in the second and third rows.\n\nStep 3: Now, we need to figure out which number is missing in the second row. Since 1 and 4 are already given in the second row, the missing number must be 3. So, the second row is |   |   | 4 |   |, and we know that 3 is in the first row, so it's | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |.\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to figure out which number is missing in the third column. We already know that 3 is in the third row, so we can start by filling in the missing number in the third row. Since the number 2 is already given in the third row, the missing number must be 1. Now the third row is |   | 4 |   | 2 |, and we know that 3 is in the first row and 4 is in the second row, so the third row is |   | 4 |   | 2 |, and we know that 1 is in the first column.\n\nStep 5: Now, we need to figure out which number is missing in the first row. We already know that 1, 2, and 3 are in the first row, so the missing number must be 4. So, the first row is | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |.\n\nStep 6: Now, we need to figure out which number is missing in the second row. We already know that 1 is in the first row, 4 is in the second row, and 2 is given in the second row, so the missing number must be 3. Now the second row is |   |   | 4 |   |.\n\nStep 7: Now, we need to figure out which number is missing in the third column. We already know that 3 is in the first row, 4 is in the second row, 2 is in the third row, so the missing number must be 1. Now the third row is |   | 4 |   | 2 |.\n\nStep 8: Now, we need to figure out which number is missing in the first row.

            "To solve the puzzle, we need to fill in the missing numbers in the grid such that each row and column contains each number exactly once.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given grid:\n\n| 1 | 2 |   | 4 |\n|   |   | 4 |   |\n|   | 4 |   | 2 |\n| 4 |   | 2 | 1 |\n\nFrom the given grid, we can see that the number 4 is already present in row 1, row 3, and row 4. This means that the number 4 cannot be placed in any other row. Similarly, the number 2 is already present in column 2 and column 4, so it also cannot be placed in these columns.\n\nLet's start by filling in the missing numbers in row 1. Since the number 4 is already present, we are left with numbers 3 and the blank space. We can place the number 3 in the blank space in row 1.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|   |   | 4 |   |\n|   | 4 |   | 2 |\n| 4 |   | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, let's focus on row 2. We can see that the number 4 is already present in column 3, so we are left with numbers 1, 2, and the blank space. We can place the number 1 in the blank space in row 2.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 |   | 4 |   |\n|   | 4 |   | 2 |\n| 4 |   | 2 | 1 |\n\nNext, let's analyze row 3. We can see that the number 4 is already present in column 2, so we are left with numbers 1, 2, and the blank space. We can place the number 2 in the blank space in row 3.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 |   | 4 |   |\n| 2 | 4 |   | 2 |\n| 4 |   | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, let's analyze column 4. We can see that the number 1 is already present in row 4, so we are left with numbers 2, 3, and the blank space. However, we have already placed the number 2 in row 3, so we are left with numbers 1 and the blank space. We can place the number 1 in the blank space in column 4.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 |   | 4 |   |\n| 2 | 4 |   | 2 |\n| 4 |   | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, let's analyze column 3. We can see that the number 4 is already present in row 2, so we are left with numbers 1, 2, and the blank space. However, we have already placed the number 1 in row 1, the number 2 in row 3, and the number 4 in column 2. This means that the number 1 cannot be placed in this column.

Since, the number 2 is already in the last column, we should place a 3 or a 1 in the fourth row in the second column and place a 1 or 3 in the second row in the fourth column.\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| 1 | 3 | 4 | 1 |\n| 2 | 4 | 1 | 3 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |\n\nNow, we have filled in all the missing numbers in the grid.\n\nFor Task 2, the solution is:\nA-1, B-2, C-3, D-4, E-1, F-3, G-4, H-2, I-4, J-1, K-3, L-2"

Additionally, the second part of the task involves distributing items into boxes with constraints, which also requires logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction.\n\n2. **Capabilities Measured:** The task measures logical reasoning, problem-solving, and state maintenance. These are advanced capabilities and require the LLM to maintain and manipulate a state throughout multiple steps of logical inference.\n\n3. **Estimated Human Difficulty:** It is marked as difficult for humans, suggesting that the task requires significant cognitive effort and logical structuring.\n\n4. **Typical LLM Performance:** LLMs, especially newer and advanced models, have demonstrated an ability to solve moderately complex logical puzzles. They can handle single-step logic problems well but might struggle with multi-step problems where maintaining state and applying complex constraints are necessary.\n\n5. **Evaluation Method:** The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to automatically score the solution is a potential concern, as LLMs can be inconsistent in judging the correctness of complex logical solutions. However, assuming the evaluation function is robust, it could reasonably validate the correctness of the solutions.\n\nConsidering these points, if the LLM succeeded at this task, it indicates a robust ability to handle complex multi-step logical reasoning and state maintenance, which goes beyond typical LLM performance for such difficult tasks. This is noteworthy and suggests significant advancement in the LLM's capabilities.\n\nDecision: Yes"
