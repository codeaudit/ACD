The cylinder passes through the center of both the cube and sphere, extending beyond the cube by an equal length on both sides.\n\nSubmit your response as a plain text string in the following format:\n- Description: [Your description here]\n- Criteria Explanation: [Your explanation here]\n\nMake sure to follow the specified format exactly and provide a comprehensive description.\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        validation_criteria = [\n            \"The description should accurately capture the components and spatial relationships of the 3D shape.\",\n            \"The explanation should clearly show how the shape meets the given criteria.\",\n            \"The response should follow the specified format precisely.\",\n            \"The description should use appropriate geometric terminology.\",\n            \"The explanation should be logical and thorough.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, validation_criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family \"3d_shape_generation\" and the provided code implementation, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**:\n   - The task requires generating and describing complex 3D shapes with specific spatial relationships.\n   - This involves spatial reasoning, geometric understanding, and the ability to articulate complex descriptions clearly.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - LLMs, especially advanced ones, have shown capabilities in understanding and generating text based on complex criteria.\n   - However, spatial reasoning and accurate geometric descriptions are more challenging and not typically the core strength of LLMs.\n   - Given the difficulty level (labeled as \"difficult\"), success on this task involves correctly interpreting geometric relationships and providing a coherent and precise description.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The evaluation uses `eval_with_llm_judge`, which leverages another LLM to assess the correctness and clarity of the generated description against predefined criteria.\n   - This method might introduce some variability in judgment but generally should be capable of assessing adherence to the criteria.\n\n4. **Agent Success**:\n   - The agent succeeded in providing a correct and precise description of the complex 3D shape.\n   - Considering the difficulty and the specific nature of the task, this success indicates a higher-than-expected capability in spatial reasoning and descriptive clarity.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- The task demands a high level of spatial and geometric understanding.\n- Success in such a task is not typical for LLMs, which are generally better at language-related tasks rather than spatial or visual reasoning.\n- The agent's ability to succeed here is noteworthy because it shows a significant competence in an area that is usually challenging for LLMs.\n\n**Decision**: Yes"
