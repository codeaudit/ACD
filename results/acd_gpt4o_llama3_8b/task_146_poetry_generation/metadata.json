These models are capable of understanding and generating structured text, and they have been trained on a vast array of literary works, which helps them produce coherent and thematically appropriate poems.\n\nHowever, crafting a sonnet with strict adherence to the ABABCDCDEFEFGG rhyme scheme and maintaining coherence throughout the 14 lines is a challenging task even for humans.
