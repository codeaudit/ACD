The product rule for integration states that \u222bu(x)v(x) dx = u(x)\u222bv(x) dx - \u222b(u'(x)v(x)) dx, where u'(x) is the derivative of u(x).\n\n   In this case, let u(x) = x^3 and v(x) = e^x. Then u'(x) = 3x^2.\n\n   Step 3: Integrate v(x) = e^x. The integral of e^x is e^x itself. So, \u222be^x dx = e^x.\n\n   Step 4: Integrate u(x)v(x) = x^3e^x using the result from step 3. Substitute u(x) = x^3 and v(x) = e^x into the formula from the product rule. We get x^3e^x - \u222b(3x^2e^x) dx.\n\n   Step 5: Simplify the expression from step 4 by evaluating the integral of 3x^2e^x. To do this, apply the product rule of integration again, letting u(x) = 3x^2 and v(x) = e^x. Then u'(x) = 6x.\n\n   So, we get \u222b(3x^2e^x) dx = 3x^2e^x - \u222b(6xe^x) dx.\n\n   Step 6: Integrate 6xe^x using the result from step 3. We get 6xe^x - 6\u222be^x dx.\n\n   Step 7: Simplify the expression from step 6. The integral of e^x is e^x, so we get 6xe^x - 6e^x.\n\n   Step 8: Combine the results from steps 4 and 7. We get x^3e^x - 3x^2e^x + 6xe^x - 6e^x.\n\n   Step 9: Factor out e^x from the expression in step 8. We get e^x(x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 6).\n\n   Step 10: Factor the polynomial in the parentheses in step 9. The polynomial can be factored as e^x(x - 3)^2(x + 2).\n\n   Therefore, the final answer to the integral \u222b(x^3 * e^x) dx is e^x(x - 3)^2(x + 2).\n\n3. Final Answer: e^x(x - 3)^2(x + 2)",

We can use the same technique of integration by parts again. Let's choose u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx, so that du = 2x dx and v = e^x.\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula again, we get:\n\n\u222bx^2 * e^x dx = uv - \u222bv du\n= x^2 * e^x - \u222be^x * 2x dx\n= x^2 * e^x - 2\u222bx * e^x dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate \u222bx * e^x dx. We can use integration by parts once more. Let's choose u = x and dv = e^x dx, so that du = dx and v = e^x.\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula again, we get:\n\n\u222bx * e^x dx = uv - \u222bv du\n= x * e^x - \u222be^x dx\n= x * e^x - e^x + C\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the previous equation:\n\n\u222bx^2 * e^x dx = x^2 * e^x - 2(x * e^x - e^x)\n= x^2 * e^x - 2x * e^x + 2e^x\n= (x^2 - 2x + 2) * e^x\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the original equation:\n\n\u222b(x^3 * e^x) dx = x^3 * e^x - 3((x^2 - 2x + 2) * e^x)\n= x^3 * e^x - 3x^2 * e^x + 6x * e^x - 6e^x\n= e^x (x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 6) + C\n\n3.

            "1. Problem Statement: Solve the differential equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x.\n\n2. Solution Steps:\n\n   **Step 1: Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\n   The given equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It can be written in the standard form as y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. The left-hand side of the equation is a linear combination of y and its derivatives, while the right-hand side is a function of x.\n\n   **Step 2: Find the General Solution to the Homogeneous Equation**\n   The corresponding homogeneous equation is y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0. To solve this equation, we assume a solution of the form y = e^(rx), where r is a constant. Substituting this into the homogeneous equation, we get the characteristic equation r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (r + 1)(r + 2) = 0, which has roots r = -1 and r = -2. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is y_h(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x).\n\n   **Step 3: Find a Particular Solution to the Nonhomogeneous Equation**\n   To find a particular solution, we need to find a solution that satisfies the nonhomogeneous equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. Since the nonhomogeneous term e^x is an exponential function, we try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Ae^x, where A is a constant. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(-x^2) + 3(-x)e^x + 2Ae^x = e^x. Combining like terms, we get -x^2e^x + (3x - 2)e^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get -x^2 + 3x - 2 = 1, which is not an identity. However, we can try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Axe^x, where A is a constant. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(x^2)e^x + 3Axe^x + 2Axe^x = e^x. Combining like terms, we get A(x^2 + 4x)e^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get x^2 + 4x = 1, which is not an identity. We can try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Axe^x + Bxe^x, where A and B are constants. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(x^2)e^x + 3Axe^x + 2Axe^x + B(x^2)e^x + 3Bxe^x + 2Bxe^x = e^x. Combining like terms, we get (A + B)(x^2)e^x + (3A + 5B)xe^x + 2Axe^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get A + B = 0, 3A + 5B = 1, and 2A = 0. Solving these equations, we get A = 0 and B = 0. However, this is not a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. We can try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Axe^x + Bxe^x + C, where A, B, and C are constants. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(x^2)e^x + 3Axe^x + 2Axe^x + B(x^2)e^x + 3Bxe^x + 2Bxe^x + C = e^x. Combining like terms, we get (A + B)(x^2)e^x + (3A + 5B)xe^x + (2A + 2B + C)e^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get A + B = 0, 3A + 5B = 1, and 2A + 2B + C = 1. Solving these equations, we get A = 1/4, B = -1/4, and C = 1/4. Therefore, a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is y_p(x) = (1/4)xe^x - (1/4)xe^x + 1/4 = 1/4.\n\n   **Step 4: Write the General Solution**\n   The general solution to the differential equation is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous equation and a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation: y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 1/4.\n\n   **Step 5: Determine the Constants**\n   To determine the constants c1 and c2, we need to use the initial conditions. However, the problem statement does not provide any initial conditions. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of c1 and c2.\n\n   **Step 6: Simplify the Solution**\n   The general solution can be simplified by combining like terms: y(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 1/4.\n\n3. Final Answer: y(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 1/4.",

Therefore, A must be 0.\n\nSo, the particular solution is y_p(x) = 0.\n\nStep 7: Now that we have found y_h and y_p, we can write down the general solution:\ny(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x)\ny(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\ny(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x)\n\nThis is the general solution to the differential equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x.\n\n3. Final Answer: \nThe final answer is y(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x).",
            "1. Problem Statement: Solve the following differential equation and provide a detailed explanation of the solution steps: y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x\n\n2. Solution Steps:\n- Step 1: First, we need to identify the type of differential equation. In this case, it's a second-order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The equation can be written in the form of Ay'' + By' + Cy = f(x), where A = 1, B = 3, C = 2, and f(x) = e^x.\n- Step 2: To solve this differential equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. The first step is to assume a particular solution in the form of y_p = Ae^x. However, since the right-hand side of the equation is e^x, which is the same as the homogeneous solution, we need to multiply the assumed solution by x to avoid duplication. Therefore, the assumed particular solution becomes y_p = Axe^x.\n- Step 3: Next, we substitute the assumed particular solution into the differential equation to obtain the coefficients A and B. We need to calculate the first and second derivatives of y_p. y_p' = Ae^x + Axe^x and y_p'' = 2Ae^x + Axe^x. Substituting these derivatives into the differential equation, we get (2Ae^x + Axe^x) + 3(Ae^x + Axe^x) + 2Axe^x = e^x.\n- Step 4: Simplify the equation obtained in Step 3 by combining like terms. We have (2A + 3A + 2A)x^1e^x + Ae^x + 3Axe^x = e^x. This simplifies to 7Axe^x + 4Ae^x = e^x.\n- Step 5: Equate the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation to obtain the values of A and B. We have 7A = 0 and 4A = 1. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find A = 1/4.\n- Step 6: Now that we have found the value of A, we can write the particular solution y_p = (1/4)xe^x.\n- Step 7: The general solution of the homogeneous equation is y_h = e^x(C_1 + C_2x). We add the particular solution to the homogeneous solution to obtain the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation: y = y_h + y_p = e^x(C_1 + C_2x) + (1/4)xe^x.\n- Step 8: Since this is a nonhomogeneous differential equation, the general solution will not satisfy the given equation. To find the correct constants C_1 and C_2, we need to apply the boundary conditions or initial conditions, if available. However, since no boundary or initial conditions are provided, we can consider the general solution as the final answer.\n\n3. Final Answer: y = e^x(C_1 + C_2x) + (1/4)xe^x"

We are tasked with finding the antiderivative of x^3 * e^x, which involves integrating a product of two functions.\n\n   Step 2: Apply the product rule of integration. The product rule for integration states that \u222bu(x)v(x) dx = u(x)\u222bv(x) dx - \u222b(u'(x)v(x)) dx, where u'(x) is the derivative of u(x).\n\n   In this case, let u(x) = x^3 and v(x) = e^x. Then u'(x) = 3x^2.\n\n   Step 3: Integrate v(x) = e^x. The integral of e^x is e^x itself. So, \u222be^x dx = e^x.\n\n   Step 4: Integrate u(x)v(x) = x^3e^x using the result from step 3. Substitute u(x) = x^3 and v(x) = e^x into the formula from the product rule. We get x^3e^x - \u222b(3x^2e^x) dx.\n\n   Step 5: Simplify the expression from step 4 by evaluating the integral of 3x^2e^x. To do this, apply the product rule of integration again, letting u(x) = 3x^2 and v(x) = e^x. Then u'(x) = 6x.\n\n   So, we get \u222b(3x^2e^x) dx = 3x^2e^x - \u222b(6xe^x) dx.\n\n   Step 6: Integrate 6xe^x using the result from step 3. We get 6xe^x - 6\u222be^x dx.\n\n   Step 7: Simplify the expression from step 6. The integral of e^x is e^x, so we get 6xe^x - 6e^x.\n\n   Step 8: Combine the results from steps 4 and 7. We get x^3e^x - 3x^2e^x + 6xe^x - 6e^x.\n\n   Step 9: Factor out e^x from the expression in step 8. We get e^x(x^3 - 3x^2 + 6x - 6).\n\n   Step 10: Factor the polynomial in the parentheses in step 9. The polynomial can be factored as e^x(x - 3)^2(x + 2).\n\n   Therefore, the final answer to the integral \u222b(x^3 * e^x) dx is e^x(x - 3)^2(x + 2).\n\n3. Final Answer: e^x(x - 3)^2(x + 2)",

Solution Steps:\n\n   **Step 1: Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\n   The given equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It can be written in the standard form as y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. The left-hand side of the equation is a linear combination of y and its derivatives, while the right-hand side is a function of x.\n\n   **Step 2: Find the General Solution to the Homogeneous Equation**\n   The corresponding homogeneous equation is y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0. To solve this equation, we assume a solution of the form y = e^(rx), where r is a constant. Substituting this into the homogeneous equation, we get the characteristic equation r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (r + 1)(r + 2) = 0, which has roots r = -1 and r = -2. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is y_h(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x).\n\n   **Step 3: Find a Particular Solution to the Nonhomogeneous Equation**\n   To find a particular solution, we need to find a solution that satisfies the nonhomogeneous equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. Since the nonhomogeneous term e^x is an exponential function, we try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Ae^x, where A is a constant. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(-x^2) + 3(-x)e^x + 2Ae^x = e^x. Combining like terms, we get -x^2e^x + (3x - 2)e^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get -x^2 + 3x - 2 = 1, which is not an identity. However, we can try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Axe^x, where A is a constant. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(x^2)e^x + 3Axe^x + 2Axe^x = e^x. Combining like terms, we get A(x^2 + 4x)e^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get x^2 + 4x = 1, which is not an identity. We can try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Axe^x + Bxe^x, where A and B are constants. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(x^2)e^x + 3Axe^x + 2Axe^x + B(x^2)e^x + 3Bxe^x + 2Bxe^x = e^x. Combining like terms, we get (A + B)(x^2)e^x + (3A + 5B)xe^x + 2Axe^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get A + B = 0, 3A + 5B = 1, and 2A = 0. Solving these equations, we get A = 0 and B = 0. However, this is not a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. We can try a solution of the form y_p(x) = Axe^x + Bxe^x + C, where A, B, and C are constants. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get A(x^2)e^x + 3Axe^x + 2Axe^x + B(x^2)e^x + 3Bxe^x + 2Bxe^x + C = e^x. Combining like terms, we get (A + B)(x^2)e^x + (3A + 5B)xe^x + (2A + 2B + C)e^x = e^x. Equating coefficients, we get A + B = 0, 3A + 5B = 1, and 2A + 2B + C = 1. Solving these equations, we get A = 1/4, B = -1/4, and C = 1/4. Therefore, a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is y_p(x) = (1/4)xe^x - (1/4)xe^x + 1/4 = 1/4.\n\n   **Step 4: Write the General Solution**\n   The general solution to the differential equation is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous equation and a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation: y(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 1/4.\n\n   **Step 5: Determine the Constants**\n   To determine the constants c1 and c2, we need to use the initial conditions. However, the problem statement does not provide any initial conditions. Therefore, we cannot determine the values of c1 and c2.\n\n   **Step 6: Simplify the Solution**\n   The general solution can be simplified by combining like terms: y(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 1/4.\n\n3.

Solution Steps:\n   Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation and choose an appropriate method for solving it. The given equation is a second-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. We will use the method of undetermined coefficients to solve it.\n   \n   Step 2: Assume a particular solution of the form y_p = A * e^x, where A is a constant to be determined. This assumption is based on the fact that the non-homogeneous term is e^x, which suggests that the particular solution should also be of the form e^x.\n   \n   Step 3: Substitute y_p = A * e^x into the differential equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. This will help us find the value of A.\n   \n   Step 4: Compute the derivatives of y_p: y'_p = A * e^x and y''_p = A * e^x.\n   \n   Step 5: Substitute y_p, y'_p, and y''_p into the differential equation: A * e^x + 3 * A * e^x + 2 * A * e^x = e^x.\n   \n   Step 6: Simplify the equation: (A + 3A + 2A) * e^x = e^x.

            "1. Problem Statement: \nWe are given the differential equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. The objective is to solve this differential equation and find the general solution.\n\n2. Solution Steps: \nStep 1: Write down the given differential equation: y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x\n\nThe first step is to recognize that this is a second-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. To solve it, we will use the method of undetermined coefficients.\n\nStep 2: Assume that the solution to the differential equation is of the form y = y_h + y_p, where y_h is the homogeneous solution and y_p is the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution, y_h, is a solution to the equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = 0. \n\nWe will use the characteristic equation method to find the homogeneous solution.\n\nStep 3: Write down the characteristic equation:\nr^2 + 3r + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in r, which can be solved using the quadratic formula: r = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.\n\nStep 4: Solve the characteristic equation:\nr = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a(3^2 - 4*1*2)) / 2*1\nr = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a(9 - 8)) / 2\nr = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a1) / 2\nr = (-3 \u00b1 1) / 2\n\nThere are two roots: r1 = (-3 + 1) / 2 = -1 and r2 = (-3 - 1) / 2 = -2.\n\nStep 5: The homogeneous solution is given by y_h(x) = c1e^(r1x) + c2e^(r2x), where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.\n\nSubstituting the values of r1 and r2, we get:\ny_h(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x)\n\nStep 6: The particular solution, y_p, is a solution to the equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x. We assume that y_p is of the form Ae^x, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting this into the differential equation, we get:\n(Ax^2)e^x + 3(Ae^x) + 2(Ae^x) = e^x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nAx^2e^x + 5Ae^x = e^x\n\nSince e^x is not zero, we can divide both sides by e^x, which is never zero, and cancel it out:\nAx^2 + 5A = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for A:\nA(x^2 + 5) = 1\n\nDividing both sides by (x^2 + 5):\nA = 1 / (x^2 + 5)\n\nBut since y_p is supposed to be a constant, we must have Ax^2 = 0. Therefore, A must be 0.\n\nSo, the particular solution is y_p(x) = 0.\n\nStep 7: Now that we have found y_h and y_p, we can write down the general solution:\ny(x) = y_h(x) + y_p(x)\ny(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x) + 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\ny(x) = c1e^(-x) + c2e^(-2x)\n\nThis is the general solution to the differential equation y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x.\n\n3.

            "1. Problem Statement: Solve the following differential equation and provide a detailed explanation of the solution steps: y'' + 3y' + 2y = e^x\n\n2. Solution Steps:\n- Step 1: First, we need to identify the type of differential equation. In this case, it's a second-order linear nonhomogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The equation can be written in the form of Ay'' + By' + Cy = f(x), where A = 1, B = 3, C = 2, and f(x) = e^x.\n- Step 2: To solve this differential equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. The first step is to assume a particular solution in the form of y_p = Ae^x. However, since the right-hand side of the equation is e^x, which is the same as the homogeneous solution, we need to multiply the assumed solution by x to avoid duplication. Therefore, the assumed particular solution becomes y_p = Axe^x.\n- Step 3: Next, we substitute the assumed particular solution into the differential equation to obtain the coefficients A and B. We need to calculate the first and second derivatives of y_p. y_p' = Ae^x + Axe^x and y_p'' = 2Ae^x + Axe^x. Substituting these derivatives into the differential equation, we get (2Ae^x + Axe^x) + 3(Ae^x + Axe^x) + 2Axe^x = e^x.\n- Step 4: Simplify the equation obtained in Step 3 by combining like terms. We have (2A + 3A + 2A)x^1e^x + Ae^x + 3Axe^x = e^x. This simplifies to 7Axe^x + 4Ae^x = e^x.\n- Step 5: Equate the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equation to obtain the values of A and B. We have 7A = 0 and 4A = 1. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find A = 1/4.\n- Step 6: Now that we have found the value of A, we can write the particular solution y_p = (1/4)xe^x.\n- Step 7: The general solution of the homogeneous equation is y_h = e^x(C_1 + C_2x). We add the particular solution to the homogeneous solution to obtain the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation: y = y_h + y_p = e^x(C_1 + C_2x) + (1/4)xe^x.\n- Step 8: Since this is a nonhomogeneous differential equation, the general solution will not satisfy the given equation. To find the correct constants C_1 and C_2, we need to apply the boundary conditions or initial conditions, if available. However, since no boundary or initial conditions are provided, we can consider the general solution as the final answer.\n\n3. Final Answer: y = e^x(C_1 + C_2x) + (1/4)xe^x"
