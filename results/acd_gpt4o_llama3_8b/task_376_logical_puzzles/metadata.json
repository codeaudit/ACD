The given rule states that if a card has a vowel on one side, then it must have an even number on the other side.\n\nInitially, we have cards 'A', '4', 'D', and '7'. The letters 'A' and 'D' are vowels. Therefore, cards 'A' and 'D' need to be turned over to test the rule that cards with vowels have even numbers on the other side. The visible faces are already '4' which is an even number. \n\nHowever, we have another card with a letter we don't know its value, '7', is an odd number but the letter on the other side is unknown. Hence we need to turn '7' as well. But we know '7' is odd, but its letter side is not given, if it were even, we would only turn 'D' because it's a vowel, we would also turn the odd '7' and then we could confirm our assumption about the even value for '7'. This thought process however is only about the other side being an even, we only want to know if we could have turned 'D' and got an odd on the other side or the other scenario,  the other card with the even number. \n\nThis shows that only '7' and 'D' should be turned over because their other sides are the unknowns and we would know if they were not according to the rule: \"If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other side\".\n\nAnswer: 7 and D",

Similarly, 'D' is a vowel, so we need to turn over the card with 'D' to check if its opposite side is an even number. For the card '7', we don't know if it's a vowel or not without turning it over, so it's not a must-turn-over card based on the given rule.

The blue house is the rightmost house, and the rightmost house is the doctor's house. \n\nThe only house left is the red house, which is the teacher's house, and we already know the teacher lives in the red house.\n\nSo, the artist lives in the leftmost house, the doctor lives in the rightmost house, and the teacher lives in the middle house.

They are generally good at pattern recognition and can follow logical steps if trained on similar tasks. However, complex logical deduction, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning and cross-referencing constraints, has been a challenging area for LLMs.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` implies that another LLM is used to judge the correctness of the solution. This is suitable for tasks where the correctness can be explicitly defined and verified, like comparing the cards to be turned over or determining house colors based on given conditions.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, which suggests it requires significant cognitive effort and careful reasoning.\n\n5. **Agent Success**: Given the complexity and difficulty of the task, an LLM successfully solving it indicates a noteworthy achievement in logical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, especially if it provided a clear and correct reasoning path.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
