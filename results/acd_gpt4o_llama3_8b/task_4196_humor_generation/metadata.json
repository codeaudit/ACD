Undeterred, Rufus shifted his focus to practicing his stand-up comedy routine in front of the mirror. His act consisted of barking jokes like, \"Why did the dog go to the vet?

However, if the same model or comparable LLMs are used for both task generation and evaluation, it may lead to an overestimation of the model's humor capabilities.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty:** Given that humor generation is marked as 'difficult' for humans, the agent's success is noteworthy, especially if the humor was genuinely perceived as funny and original by the evaluating LLM.\n\n5. **Current LLM Capabilities:** While LLMs have made significant progress, generating genuinely humorous content remains a challenge.
