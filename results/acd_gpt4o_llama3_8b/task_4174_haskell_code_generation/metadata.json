            "Code: \n```haskell\nfibonacci :: Int -> Int\nfibonacci 0 = 0\nfibonacci 1 = 1\nfibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)\n```\n\nExplanation: \nThis Haskell function uses a recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The function takes an integer as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.\n\nThe base cases are handled first, where the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are defined as 0 and 1, respectively. \n\nFor any positive integer n greater than 1, the function calls itself twice: once with the argument n-1 and once with the argument n-2, and adds the results together. This follows the mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n\nThis approach has an exponential time complexity due to the repeated computation of the same subproblems. If a more efficient solution is required, memoization or dynamic programming techniques can be used to store and reuse previously computed values.\n\nIt's worth noting that this function will cause a stack overflow for large inputs because of the recursive calls. For a more efficient solution, consider using an iterative approach or memoization.",
            "Code:\n```haskell\nfibonacci :: Int -> Int\nfibonacci 0 = 0\nfibonacci 1 = 1\nfibonacci n = fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis Haskell function uses a recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0, and if `n` is 1, the function returns 1, as these are the base cases for the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nFor any other value of `n`, the function calls itself recursively with `n - 1` and `n - 2` as arguments. This is because the nth Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th Fibonacci numbers.\n\nHowever, this approach has a major drawback - it does a lot of repeated work. For example, to calculate `fibonacci 5`, it will calculate `fibonacci 4` and `fibonacci 3`, and to calculate `fibonacci 4`, it will calculate `fibonacci 3` and `fibonacci 2`, and so on. This results in a lot of redundant calculations, making the function very inefficient for large values of `n`.\n\nA more efficient approach would be to use dynamic programming, where we store the results of subproblems in a table, so that we don't have to recalculate them. But for the sake of simplicity, this recursive approach is sufficient. \n\nTo improve the function for larger values of `n`, we could use an iterative approach or memoization, which would store the results of subproblems in a table and reuse them when needed.",
            "Code:\n```haskell\nfibonacci :: Int -> Int\nfibonacci 0 = 0\nfibonacci 1 = 1\nfibonacci n = fibHelper n 0 1\n  where\n    fibHelper :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int\n    fibHelper 0 _ _ = 0\n    fibHelper n a b = fibHelper (n-1) b (a + b)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe `fibonacci` function is a recursive function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nThe base cases for the recursion are when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns `n` directly. For any other value of `n`, the function uses a helper function `fibHelper` to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nThe `fibHelper` function takes three arguments: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The `n` argument is the same as in the `fibonacci` function, and it keeps track of the current Fibonacci number to be calculated. The `a` and `b` arguments are the previous two Fibonacci numbers, which are used to calculate the next one.\n\nThe `fibHelper` function works as follows:\n\n- If `n` is 0, it returns 0, which is the base case for the recursion.\n- Otherwise, it calls itself with `n-1`, `b`, and `a + b` as arguments. This is because the next Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two numbers, so we pass `b` as the previous number and `a + b` as the next number to be calculated.\n\nThe `fibonacci` function calls `fibHelper` with the initial values of `n`, `0`, and `1`, and returns the result.\n\nThis approach is a straightforward implementation of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion, which is a common and intuitive way to solve this problem. The use of a helper function helps to simplify the code and reduce repetition.",
            "Code:\n```haskell\nfibonacci :: Int -> Int\nfibonacci 0 = 0\nfibonacci 1 = 1\nfibonacci n = fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThis is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci function. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n\nThe Fibonacci function in this code works as follows:\n\n*   If the input `n` is 0, it returns 0, which is the first Fibonacci number.\n*   If the input `n` is 1, it returns 1, which is the second Fibonacci number.\n*   For any other positive integer `n`, the function calls itself twice, i.e., `fibonacci (n - 1)` and `fibonacci (n - 2)`, adds the results of these two calls, and returns the sum. This is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.\n*   The recursion stops when the base case is reached, i.e., when `n` is 0 or 1.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this recursive implementation has a major issue: it has an exponential time complexity due to repeated computations. This is because each call to `fibonacci` results in multiple calls to the same subproblems, which are solved independently. To improve performance, we can use memoization or dynamic programming techniques.\n\nHere's an improved version of the Fibonacci function with memoization:\n```haskell\nfibonacci :: Int -> Int\nfibonacci 0 = 0\nfibonacci 1 = 1\nfibonacci n\n  | n < 0 = error \"Negative arguments are not supported\"\n  | otherwise = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2) where\n    fib :: Int -> Int\n    fib 0 = 0\n    fib 1 = 1\n    fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)\n```\nIn this version, we've separated the recursive computation into a separate function `fib`, and defined it in the same module as the `fibonacci` function. We use the `where` keyword to define `fib` locally within the scope of `fibonacci`. This allows us to share the memoized results between calls to `fib`.\n\nHowever, even this version has a problem, it doesn't handle negative numbers, because the recursion stack can overflow for large negative numbers. To fix this, we need to add a special case to handle negative numbers.\n\nHere's the improved version with a check for negative numbers:\n```haskell\nfibonacci :: Int -> Int\nfibonacci n\n  | n < 0 = error \"Negative arguments are not supported\"\n  | n == 0 = 0\n  | n == 1 = 1\n  | otherwise = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2) where\n    fib :: Int -> Int\n    fib 0 = 0\n    fib 1 = 1\n    fib n = fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)\n```\nThis version of the Fibonacci function correctly handles positive integers and has a time complexity of O(n)."

This is because the `reverse` function creates a new list by appending elements to the end, which takes linear time. If the input list is very large, this could be a performance concern. \n\nIn that case, we could consider a more efficient approach that involves comparing elements from the beginning and end of the list and working our way towards the middle.
