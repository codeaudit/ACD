Equation: {t["equation"]}
Scenario: {t["scenario"]}

Ensure that the word problem is clear, understandable, and accurately represents the given mathematical equation or scenario. The word problem should be feasible and realistic in a real-world context. Provide the word problem as a plain text string. Format your response as follows:

Word Problem: [Your word problem]

Example:
For the equation 'x + 3 = 7', a suitable word problem could be: 'John has three more apples than Mary. If John has seven apples, how many apples does Mary have?'"""
