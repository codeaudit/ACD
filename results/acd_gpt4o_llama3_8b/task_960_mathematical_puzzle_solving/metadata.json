Start by scanning the puzzle for any obvious solutions, such as naked singles (cells that only contain one possible value) or hidden singles (cells that only contain one possible value after eliminating other possibilities in the same row, column, or box).\n2. Use the \"naked pair\" and \"hidden pair\" techniques to eliminate possibilities in the same row, column, or box.\n3.

The puzzle is represented by a list of row and column constraints, where each constraint specifies the lengths of contiguous blocks of filled cells in that row or column. Produce a 5x5 grid where '1' represents a filled cell and '0' represents an empty cell.\n\nRow constraints: {', '.join(map(str, t['rows']))}\nColumn constraints: {', '.join(map(str, t['cols']))}\n\nSubmit your solution as a 5x5 grid of '0' and '1' characters, with each row on a new line, and characters separated by spaces. For example:\n1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0\n...\n\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        if t[\"type\"] == \"Sudoku\":\n            validation_criteria = [\n                \"The solution should be a valid 9x9 Sudoku grid.\",\n                \"Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid should contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once.\",\n                \"The solution should be formatted as a 9x9 grid with each row on a new line and digits separated by spaces.\"\n            ]\n        elif t[\"type\"] == \"Nonogram\":\n            validation_criteria = [\n                \"The solution should be a valid 5x5 Nonogram grid.\",\n                \"The grid should satisfy the given row and column constraints.\",\n                \"The solution should be formatted as a 5x5 grid with each row on a new line and characters ('0' and '1') separated by spaces.\"\n            ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, validation_criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Reasoning about the task family: \nThis task family involves solving mathematical puzzles such as Sudoku and Nonogram, which require spatial and logical reasoning. Sudoku puzzles, especially, can be quite challenging due to the need for consistency across rows, columns, and subgrids. Nonograms also require a level of deductive reasoning to fill in cells correctly based on given constraints. \n\nCurrent LLM capabilities:\n- LLMs are generally proficient at text-based logical reasoning and can assist with certain mathematical problems.\n- However, solving complex spatial reasoning problems like Sudoku, which require maintaining multiple constraints simultaneously, is generally outside their typical scope without specialized training or algorithms.\n- Nonogram solving involves visual pattern recognition and constraint satisfaction, which may also be challenging for an LLM unless it has been specifically trained on similar tasks.\n\nGiven this context, solving a Sudoku puzzle correctly would be quite surprising, as it involves maintaining multiple constraints and a high level of logical consistency. Success at this task would indicate a significant capability in spatial and logical reasoning.\n\nDecision: Yes"
