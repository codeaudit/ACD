            "Strategy: \n\n1. Assess the situation: \n   - Gather information about the fire's current location, speed, and direction of spread.\n   - Identify any potential bottlenecks in the evacuation route (the main road) and any areas of high risk or concern.\n\n2. Evacuation prioritization: \n   - Prioritize the evacuation of vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and those with disabilities.\n   - Focus on areas closest to the fire's edge and areas with limited escape routes.\n\n3. Resource allocation: \n   - Assign 4 firefighters to each fire truck (2 trucks will be used for evacuation, 1 for fire containment).\n   - Designate 1 helicopter for evacuation support (for those unable to evacuate by road, such as the elderly or those with disabilities).\n\n4. Evacuation protocol:\n   - Send 2 fire trucks to the main road to escort the first wave of evacuees, prioritizing those in high-risk areas.\n   - Use the helicopter to transport vulnerable populations to a safe location, such as a designated evacuation center.\n   - Allocate the remaining firefighters to assist with crowd control, emergency medical services, and communication.\n\n5.
