This involves understanding domain-specific knowledge about fitness, demonstrating creativity in designing routines, and adhering to practical constraints.\n\nGiven the capabilities of current large language models, they are generally proficient at generating structured text based on given instructions, especially when the instructions are clear and detailed. LLMs have access to a vast amount of information, including fitness-related data, and can synthesize this information to create coherent and practical outputs. Therefore, the task demands alignment with specified goals, adherence to constraints, and format compliance, all of which are within the capabilities of modern LLMs.\n\nThe example provided specifies a clear structure for the output, which the LLM can follow. Additionally, the constraints (no gym equipment, 30 minutes per day, suitable for beginners) are straightforward and do not require expert-level fitness knowledge to address. The LLM judge evaluates the response based on clear criteria, making it a suitable evaluation method.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is expected that a sufficiently advanced LLM would succeed at this task.
