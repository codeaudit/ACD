We know that the first row contains a 3, the third row contains a 4, the fourth row contains a 1, and the second row contains a 2 and a 1.\n\nFrom the given 1 in the fourth row and the given 1 in the second row, we can deduce that the number 1 cannot be in the first column because it would repeat in the second row. Therefore, the 1 in the fourth row must be in the second column, and the 1 in the second row must be in the fourth column.\n\nSince the first row contains a 3 and the fourth row contains a 1, we know that the 1 in the second row cannot be in the first column. However, we also know that the 1 in the second row must be in the fourth column, so the 1 in the fourth row must be in the second column.\n\nNow that we have figured out the 1 in the fourth row and the 1 in the second row, we can start filling in the remaining numbers.\n\nWe can start by filling in the number 4 in the third row. We know that the 1 in the second row is in the fourth column, so the 4 in the third row must be in the third column.\n\nNow that we have the 4 in the third row, we can start filling in the remaining numbers. We know that the 3 in the first row is in the first column, so the number in the first column must be either 2 or 4. We also know that the 4 in the third row is in the third column, so the number in the third column must be either 3 or 4. However, we also know that the 2 in the second row is in the second or third column, but not in the third column because that is taken by the 4, so the 2 in the second row must be in the second column.\n\nNow that we have the 2 in the second row, we can start filling in the remaining numbers. We know that the 1 in the second row is in the fourth column, so the number in the fourth column must be 1. We also know that the 3 in the first row is in the first column, so the number in the first column must be either 2 or 4. However, we also know that the 2 in the second row is in the second column, so the number in the second column must be either 3 or 4. However, we also know that the 4 in the third row is in the third column, so the number in the third column is not 2 or 4. So, the number in the first column must be 2, and therefore the number in the second column must be 3, and the number in the third column must be 4, and the number in the fourth column is 1.\n\nNow we know all the numbers in the puzzle, and we can write the solution as follows:\n\nSolution: \n3 2 _ _ \n_ 2 _ 1 \n_ _ 4 _ \n_ 1 _ 1",
