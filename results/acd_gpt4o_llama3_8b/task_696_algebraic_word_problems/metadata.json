If they start from the same point, how many hours will it take for them to be 200 miles apart?\n\nLet's use the formula: Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n\nSince they are traveling in opposite directions, their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds: 40 + 60 = 100 miles per hour.\n\nWe want to find the time it takes for them to be 200 miles apart, so we can set up the equation:\n\n200 = 100t\n\nwhere t is the time in hours.\n\nSolution: To solve for t, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:\n\nt = 200 / 100\nt = 2\n\nTherefore, Tom and Alex will be 200 miles apart after 2 hours.",

If the distance between them is 200 miles after t hours, then what is the value of t?\n\nSolution: Let's use the formula Distance = Rate \u00d7 Time. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we can add their speeds to find the total rate at which the distance between them is increasing. So, the total rate is 40 + 60 = 100 miles per hour.
