A wise person and a foolish one are like two different navigators on a ship, with the wise one charting a safe course through treacherous waters and the foolish one steering straight into the rocks.\n3. A leader and a follower are like two dancers performing a choreographed routine, with the leader setting the pace and the follower mirroring their every step.\n4.

Just as fire burns brightly at high temperatures, ice melts under the warmth of the sun.\n\nMoving to the second pair, strong and weak, the relationship can be described as contrasting levels of physical strength or ability. A strong person or object has a higher capacity for exertion or resistance, while a weak one has a lower capacity. This contrast can be illustrated in the following sentence:\n2. Just as a strong rope can hold a heavy load, a weak rope snaps under minimal weight.\n\nFor the third pair, truth and lie, the relationship can be described as opposing states of honesty or accuracy. Truth represents a factual or accurate statement, while a lie represents a false or misleading one. The contrast between these two can be exemplified in the following sentence:\n3.
