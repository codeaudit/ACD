This should facilitate the LLM in generating a precise and correct response.\n  \n2. **Scoring Method:** The `score` function uses the `eval_with_llm_judge` method to evaluate the responses based on well-defined criteria. This is a suitable method for automated scoring as it ensures that the responses are logically consistent and correct.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe task of identifying a pattern in a number sequence, particularly when the sequence is composed of prime numbers, is well within the capabilities of current LLMs. Success in this task is expected given the LLM's training on large corpora that include mathematical content and problem-solving examples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nDecision: No"
