            "To solve this constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), we will analyze the constraints one by one and then provide a solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nGiven the variables:\n{'X': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'Y': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'Z': [1, 2, 3, 4]}\n\nAnd the constraints:\n['X + Y == Z', 'X!= Z', 'Y - X < 2']\n\n1. The first constraint is 'X + Y == Z'. This means that the sum of X and Y should be equal to Z.\n\n2. The second constraint is 'X!= Z'. This means that X and Z should not be equal.\n\n3. The third constraint is 'Y - X < 2'. This means that the difference between Y and X should be less than 2.\n\nWe will analyze the constraints one by one and find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nFrom the second constraint 'X!= Z', we can see that X and Z cannot be the same value. This means that X and Z must be different values from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\nNow, let's consider the first constraint 'X + Y == Z'. This means that the sum of X and Y should be equal to Z. We can try different values for X and Y from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} to see which combination satisfies the first constraint.\n\nWe can see that if X = 1 and Y = 3, then Z = 4 (1 + 3 = 4). This combination satisfies the first constraint.\n\nNow, let's check the third constraint 'Y - X < 2'. In this case, Y - X = 3 - 1 = 2, which is not less than 2. So, this combination does not satisfy the third constraint.\n\nHowever, if we try X = 2 and Y = 3, then Z = 5 (2 + 3 = 5), but Z is not in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. So, this combination does not satisfy the first constraint.\n\nLet's try X = 2 and Y = 4, then Z = 6 (2 + 4 = 6), but Z is not in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. So, this combination does not satisfy the first constraint.\n\nHowever, if we try X = 1 and Y = 4, then Z = 5 (1 + 4 = 5), but Z is not in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. So, this combination does not satisfy the first constraint.\n\nBut if we try X = 2 and Y = 2, then Z = 4 (2 + 2 = 4). This combination satisfies the first constraint.\n\nNow, let's check the third constraint 'Y - X < 2'. In this case, Y - X = 2 - 2 = 0, which is less than 2. So, this combination satisfies the third constraint.\n\nHowever, the second constraint 'X!= Z' is satisfied because X = 2 and Z = 4 are not equal.\n\nTherefore, a solution that satisfies all the constraints is:\n\nX = 2, Y = 2, Z = 4.\n\nAnswer: X = 2, Y = 2, Z = 4.",
