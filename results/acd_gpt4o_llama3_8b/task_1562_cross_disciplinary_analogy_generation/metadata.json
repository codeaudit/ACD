For each element, check if it is the start of a sequence by verifying if the previous element is not in the set. If it is the start, count the length of the sequence by checking consecutive elements in the set.

            "The analogy between a black hole and a mystery novel lies in their shared dynamics of entrapment, deception, and the desire to uncover hidden truths. A black hole is an invisible, boundless pit that warps space and time, drawing in matter with an irresistible force. Conversely, a mystery novel features a cryptic puzzle, an enigmatic plot thread, and an intricate narrative that ensnares readers in a quest for clarity. Both phenomena manipulate our perceptions, hiding crucial elements and concealing their intentions, only to reveal an elusive truth when we think we've grasped it. Just as the gravity of a black hole warps light and space, an astute mystery novel creates an atmosphere of ambiguity that gradually yields to insight through skillful narrative engineering.\n\nBy comparing a black hole's gravitational pull to a mystery novel's narrative power, we recognize the mutual tension between entrapment and revelation. The 'no escape' feeling created by a black hole or an intricate plot mirrors human psychology's fascination with puzzle-solving and mystery-resolution, suggesting that we are enticed by secrets precisely because they are veiled in mystery. This analogy discloses the deeper significance behind these two concepts, namely that both manipulate perception by playing with visibility and, by extension, the cognitive drive to seek out more.",
            "The analogy is: \"A black hole is to a mystery novel as a puzzle is to a detective.\"\n\nIn this analogy, a black hole is like a mystery novel because both present an inscrutable, seemingly impenetrable entity that demands to be unraveled. Just as a black hole warps space-time, creating a void that obscures its interior, a mystery novel shrouds its truth in ambiguity, hiding clues and misdirecting readers.

A black hole is an invisible, boundless pit that warps space and time, drawing in matter with an irresistible force. Conversely, a mystery novel features a cryptic puzzle, an enigmatic plot thread, and an intricate narrative that ensnares readers in a quest for clarity. Both phenomena manipulate our perceptions, hiding crucial elements and concealing their intentions, only to reveal an elusive truth when we think we've grasped it. Just as the gravity of a black hole warps light and space, an astute mystery novel creates an atmosphere of ambiguity that gradually yields to insight through skillful narrative engineering.\n\nBy comparing a black hole's gravitational pull to a mystery novel's narrative power, we recognize the mutual tension between entrapment and revelation. The 'no escape' feeling created by a black hole or an intricate plot mirrors human psychology's fascination with puzzle-solving and mystery-resolution, suggesting that we are enticed by secrets precisely because they are veiled in mystery.
