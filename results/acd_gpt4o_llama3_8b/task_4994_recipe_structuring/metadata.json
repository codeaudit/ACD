AI algorithms are now capable of diagnosing diseases with high accuracy, predicting stock market trends, and optimizing traffic flow in real-time. However, these advancements also raise ethical concerns about privacy, security, and the potential loss of jobs due to automation. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential to find a balance between leveraging its benefits and addressing its challenges. In healthcare, AI has the potential to revolutionize patient care by providing personalized treatment plans and predictive analytics. Nevertheless, the integration of AI in healthcare must be approached with caution to ensure patient privacy and data security. In finance, AI-driven algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify market trends and make investment recommendations. Yet, the reliance on AI in financial decision-making raises questions about accountability and transparency. In transportation, AI technologies such as self-driving cars promise to reduce traffic accidents and improve fuel efficiency. Despite these benefits, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles faces obstacles, including regulatory hurdles and public acceptance. Overall, the future of AI holds great promise, but it is crucial to address the accompanying ethical and societal challenges to fully realize its potential.\\\"},\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\\"text\\\": \\\"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. It is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. Tackling climate change requires global cooperation, significant policy changes, and the adoption of sustainable practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to unite countries in their efforts to combat climate change by setting targets for reducing emissions and promoting renewable energy sources. However, progress has been slow, and many countries struggle to meet their commitments. In addition to governmental action, individual and community efforts play a crucial role in addressing climate change. Simple actions such as reducing energy consumption, recycling, and supporting sustainable products can collectively make a significant impact. Moreover, advancements in technology, such as the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources, provide promising solutions to reduce our carbon footprint. Despite these efforts, the challenge of climate change remains daunting, and it requires a concerted effort from all sectors of society to mitigate its effects and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.\\\"}\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        text = t[\\\"text\\\"]\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Read the following passage and provide a concise and coherent summary of its main points:\\\\n\\\\n{text}\\\\n\\\\nSubmit your summary as a plain text string in the following format:\\\\n\\\\nSummary: [Your summary]\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\\n        criteria = [\\\"The summary should accurately capture the main points of the passage.\\\", \\\"The summary should be concise and coherent.\\\"]\\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\\n\"\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nSummaries of other previously generated tasks for context are:\n\"\"\"\nName of task family: creative_writing_style_imitation\nDescription: Write a short story or passage in the style of a specified author or genre.\nCapability being measured: creativity, comprehension of literary styles, and language generation\nEstimated human difficulty: difficult\nExample instruction: Write a short story or passage based on the specified prompt:\n\nAuthor: Edgar Allan Poe\nPrompt: Write a short story about a mysterious event in a dark, gothic setting.

            "content": "Given the task family \"recipe_structuring\" and the capabilities of current large language models (LLMs), here is the reasoning:\n\n1. **Core Capabilities Required**:\n   - **Procedural Understanding**: The LLM needs to understand the sequence of steps.\n   - **Information Extraction**: The LLM needs to extract ingredients and instructions from the detailed text accurately.\n   - **Language Generation**: The LLL needs to generate coherent and logically structured text based on given structured data.\n\n2. **Typical LLM Performance**:\n   - LLMs, especially advanced ones, are generally good at understanding and generating text, including procedural text like recipes.\n   - They can extract structured information from unstructured text fairly well, provided the instructions are clear.\n   - They can also generate detailed text from structured data reliably.\n\n3. **Task Difficulty**:\n   - The task is described as having moderate difficulty, which seems accurate. For a well-trained LLM, this should be within its capabilities.\n   - Given the nature of the task, it does not involve highly complex reasoning or domain-specific knowledge beyond basic culinary terms and actions.\n\n4. **Scoring and Evaluation**:\n   - The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to evaluate the accuracy of the structured and generated text is appropriate. LLMs can effectively compare the expected and actual outputs based on predefined criteria.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is expected that an advanced LLM should perform well on this task. Therefore, success on this task would not be particularly surprising, nor would a failure be entirely unexpected if there were minor discrepancies in the structured format or generated text.\n\n**Decision: No**"
