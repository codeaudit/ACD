            "Emotional States: John - excited, nervous, disheartened, frustrated; Board Members - uninterested, critical\n\nRationale: John's emotional states can be inferred from the details given in the scenario. Firstly, he felt a \"mix of excitement and nervousness\" as he prepared to present his work to the board. This indicates that he was anticipating the outcome of his presentation and was invested in its success. The fact that he was nervous suggests that he was also aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with the presentation.\n\nHowever, during the presentation, the board members seemed \"uninterested and critical.\" This suggests that they were not engaged with John's work and were instead focused on finding fault with it. As a result, John left the meeting feeling \"disheartened and frustrated.\" These emotions can be attributed to the board members' negative reactions to his presentation, which likely made him feel undervalued and unappreciated.\n\nThe board members' emotional states can also be inferred from their behavior. Their lack of interest and critical attitude towards John's presentation suggests that they were not invested in the project or its success. This may indicate that they were not supportive of John's work or that they had their own agendas or biases that were not aligned with his goals.",
            "Emotional States: John - disheartened, frustrated, excited, nervous; Board members - uninterested, critical\n\nRationale: \n- John felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as he prepared to present his work to the board. This suggests that John was anticipating the presentation and was invested in its outcome, which is a key indicator of excitement. The nervousness likely stemmed from the potential consequences of a successful or unsuccessful presentation, indicating that John was also anxious about how his work would be received. \n- During the presentation, the board members seemed uninterested and critical. Their lack of interest may have been due to a lack of engagement with the content or a lack of enthusiasm for the project, which would explain their uninterested behavior. Their critical attitude, however, suggests that they were actively evaluating John's work and providing feedback, even if it was negative.\n\n- After the presentation, John left the meeting feeling disheartened and frustrated. This emotional shift from a mix of excitement and nervousness to disheartened and frustrated suggests that the board members' uninterested and critical responses had a negative impact on John. The disheartened state can be attributed to the lack of support or enthusiasm from the board members, which may have made John feel his efforts were not valued. The frustration, on the other hand, likely stemmed from the critical feedback, which may have been perceived as harsh or unconstructive.",
            "Emotional States: John - excitement, nervousness, disheartened, frustrated; Board Members - uninterested, critical\n\nRationale: John's emotional state can be broken down based on the events described in the scenario. Initially, he felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as he prepared to present his work to the board. This suggests that he was looking forward to sharing his project but was also anxious about how it would be received. However, during the presentation, the board members seemed uninterested and critical, which likely contributed to John's subsequent emotional state of disheartened and frustrated. The fact that the board members did not appear engaged or supportive suggests that their uninterested and critical attitude towards John's work was a disappointment for him.",
            "Emotional States: Excitement, Nervousness, Disheartened, Frustrated, Uninterested, Critical\n\nRationale: \nThe emotional states of the characters involved can be identified through a careful analysis of the scenario. \n\nJohn is initially described as feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as he prepares to present his work to the board. This suggests that he is anticipating a positive outcome and is eager to share his work, but is also anxious about the potential for criticism or rejection. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of anticipation and apprehension.\n\nDuring the presentation, the board members are described as seeming uninterested and critical. This suggests that they are not engaged or invested in John's work, and are instead focused on pointing out its flaws. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of disconnection and negativity.\n\nAfter the meeting, John is described as feeling disheartened and frustrated. This suggests that he is disappointed and upset by the board's reaction to his work, and is struggling to cope with the negative feedback. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of sadness and anger.\n\nThe board members' emotional states are inferred through their behavior and interactions with John. Their seeming uninterest and criticism suggests that they are not invested in John's work, and are instead focused on evaluating it based on its technical merits. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of detachment and objectivity.\n\nOverall, the emotional states of the characters involved in this scenario are complex and multifaceted, reflecting a range of emotions including excitement, nervousness, disheartened, frustration, uninterest, and criticism.",
            "Emotional States: Anxiety, Disappointment, Frustration, Disheartened\n\nRationale: \nJohn's initial emotional state is a mix of excitement and nervousness, indicating a sense of anticipation and apprehension about the presentation, which is a common response to a challenging or high-stakes situation. The fact that he had been working tirelessly for weeks on the project also suggests that he has invested significant time and effort, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and nervousness. \n\nDuring the presentation, the board members' uninterested and critical attitude is likely to have exacerbated John's anxiety, causing him to feel anxious and disheartened. This is because their negative reaction would have likely threatened the value and significance of his work. Additionally, their criticism would have made John question his abilities and the effectiveness of his project, leading to feelings of frustration."

            "Emotional States: Disappointment, Self-doubt, Overwhelmed\n\nRationale: Emily's emotional state can be analyzed as follows:\n\n* Disappointment: Emily received a lower grade than expected on a major exam, which suggests that she had high expectations for herself. This unmet expectation likely led to feelings of disappointment, as she had likely been striving for perfection.\n* Self-doubt: Emily's feelings of inadequacy suggest that she is questioning her abilities and second-guessing herself. This self-doubt is a common consequence of disappointment, as individuals may start to wonder if they are truly capable of achieving their goals.\n* Overwhelmed: The combination of disappointment and self-doubt likely left Emily feeling overwhelmed, as she struggled to cope with the emotional fallout of her lower grade. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of being unable to manage one's emotions or circumstances, which is consistent with Emily's description of feeling unable to shake off her feelings of inadequacy.",

This suggests that Emily is questioning her abilities and doubting her potential, which is a common emotional response to failure or not meeting expectations (Scenario). \nOverwhelmed: Emily felt overwhelmed with disappointment and self-doubt.

The fact that she felt \"overwhelmed with disappointment\" suggests that she was deeply invested in achieving a high grade and was let down by the result.\n- Self-doubt: Emily's feelings of inadequacy after receiving the lower grade suggest that she is questioning her abilities and doubting her potential to succeed. This is a common response to failure or not meeting one's own expectations.\n- Overwhelmed: The scenario describes Emily as feeling \"overwhelmed\" by her disappointment and self-doubt.

This disappointment is further exacerbated by her feeling of self-doubt, as she is questioning her abilities and competence. The fact that she \"couldn't shake off the feeling of inadequacy\" suggests that she is also experiencing a sense of inadequacy, which is a common consequence of self-doubt.

            "Emotional States: \nDisappointment, Self-doubt, Overwhelmed\n\nRationale: \nThe emotional state of Disappointment is evident in the scenario as Emily received a lower grade than expected on a major exam, which typically elicits feelings of dissatisfaction and frustration. This is explicitly stated in the scenario as Emily felt \"overwhelmed with disappointment and self-doubt.\"\n\nThe emotional state of Self-doubt is also present as Emily is plagued by feelings of inadequacy, which is a common consequence of receiving an unexpected lower grade.

The disheartened state can be attributed to the lack of support or enthusiasm from the board members, which may have made John feel his efforts were not valued. The frustration, on the other hand, likely stemmed from the critical feedback, which may have been perceived as harsh or unconstructive.",
            "Emotional States: John - excitement, nervousness, disheartened, frustrated; Board Members - uninterested, critical\n\nRationale: John's emotional state can be broken down based on the events described in the scenario. Initially, he felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as he prepared to present his work to the board. This suggests that he was looking forward to sharing his project but was also anxious about how it would be received. However, during the presentation, the board members seemed uninterested and critical, which likely contributed to John's subsequent emotional state of disheartened and frustrated. The fact that the board members did not appear engaged or supportive suggests that their uninterested and critical attitude towards John's work was a disappointment for him.",
            "Emotional States: Excitement, Nervousness, Disheartened, Frustrated, Uninterested, Critical\n\nRationale: \nThe emotional states of the characters involved can be identified through a careful analysis of the scenario. \n\nJohn is initially described as feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness as he prepares to present his work to the board. This suggests that he is anticipating a positive outcome and is eager to share his work, but is also anxious about the potential for criticism or rejection. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of anticipation and apprehension.\n\nDuring the presentation, the board members are described as seeming uninterested and critical. This suggests that they are not engaged or invested in John's work, and are instead focused on pointing out its flaws. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of disconnection and negativity.\n\nAfter the meeting, John is described as feeling disheartened and frustrated. This suggests that he is disappointed and upset by the board's reaction to his work, and is struggling to cope with the negative feedback. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of sadness and anger.\n\nThe board members' emotional states are inferred through their behavior and interactions with John. Their seeming uninterest and criticism suggests that they are not invested in John's work, and are instead focused on evaluating it based on its technical merits. This emotional state is characterized by a sense of detachment and objectivity.\n\nOverall, the emotional states of the characters involved in this scenario are complex and multifaceted, reflecting a range of emotions including excitement, nervousness, disheartened, frustration, uninterest, and criticism.",
            "Emotional States: Anxiety, Disappointment, Frustration, Disheartened\n\nRationale: \nJohn's initial emotional state is a mix of excitement and nervousness, indicating a sense of anticipation and apprehension about the presentation, which is a common response to a challenging or high-stakes situation. The fact that he had been working tirelessly for weeks on the project also suggests that he has invested significant time and effort, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and nervousness. \n\nDuring the presentation, the board members' uninterested and critical attitude is likely to have exacerbated John's anxiety, causing him to feel anxious and disheartened. This is because their negative reaction would have likely threatened the value and significance of his work. Additionally, their criticism would have made John question his abilities and the effectiveness of his project, leading to feelings of frustration."
