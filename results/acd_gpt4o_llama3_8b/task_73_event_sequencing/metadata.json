The rising water level makes it difficult for cars to navigate through the streets, leading to a buildup of traffic congestion. The heavy rain and flooded roads force many drivers to abandon their vehicles and seek shelter, resulting in a surge of pedestrians seeking refuge in nearby buildings. As the rain continues to pour down, the buildings' drainage systems become overwhelmed, causing water to seep into the structures and creating a mess inside. Eventually, the prolonged rain causes the buildings' electrical systems to malfunction, plunging the interior into darkness, and leaving the people seeking shelter in a precarious and uncomfortable situation.",
            "As the rain intensifies, the streets begin to flood, causing a backup of traffic on the roads. The drivers, caught off guard by the sudden downpour, struggle to maintain control of their vehicles, leading to a series of accidents and near-misses. The emergency services are quickly overwhelmed with calls, and rescue teams are dispatched to the scene to assist with evacuations and provide medical aid to those injured. As the situation spirals out of control, the local authorities declare a state of emergency, activating the city's flood response plan and deploying sandbags and pumps to reinforce the city's defenses. With the rain showing no signs of letting up, the residents of the city are forced to take shelter, with many seeking refuge in nearby buildings, community centers, and other safe zones.",
            "As it starts raining heavily, the streets quickly become flooded, causing many drivers to lose control of their vehicles and skid on the wet roads. The flooding also leads to a power outage in the neighborhood, plunging homes into darkness. With the power out, the residents are unable to use their refrigerators, causing food to spoil and attracting a swarm of insects. As the insects buzz around the homes, they become a nuisance to the residents, who are already dealing with the noise of the rain and the sound of water dripping from the rooftops. As the rain continues to pour down, the nearby river begins to overflow its banks, threatening to flood the surrounding areas and potentially causing more destruction."

After a brief moment of grogginess, they swing their legs over the side of the bed and plant their feet firmly on the ground, feeling the cool morning air on their skin. They then stand up and make their way to the bathroom to start their morning routine, flipping on the light switch to illuminate the space.

            "As the heavy rain continues to fall, the roads become increasingly flooded, causing traffic to slow to a crawl. The drivers struggle to maintain traction on the wet pavement, and some vehicles stall, blocking the flow of traffic even further. The stranded drivers scramble to find alternative routes, but the surrounding streets are also congested, leading to a massive traffic jam. As the rain intensifies, the drivers' visibility decreases, and they must rely on their wipers to clear the water from their windshields, which only seems to make the task more challenging. Eventually, the rain becomes too heavy to drive in safely, and the drivers are forced to abandon their vehicles and seek shelter until the storm passes.\n\nAnswer: It starts raining heavily.

This task specifically assesses the model's temporal reasoning and ability to maintain coherence through multiple steps, which are capabilities that advanced LLMs are typically expected to handle.\n\nThe provided example instruction is straightforward and well within the capabilities of most modern large language models. The task involves generating a sequence of five coherent and logically connected events based on an initial trigger, and the evaluation criteria are clear and measurable. Furthermore, the use of an LLM judge for scoring seems appropriate as it can handle evaluating logical coherence and adherence to the given criteria.\n\nGiven the current state of LLM capabilities, successfully completing this task is not surprising.
