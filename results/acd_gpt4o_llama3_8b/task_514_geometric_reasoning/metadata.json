In this case, we have c = 5 and one of the legs, let's say a, is 3. We need to find the length of the other leg, b. Substituting the given values into the equation, we get 5^2 = 3^2 + b^2, which simplifies to 25 = 9 + b^2. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us b^2 = 16.

In this case, we have c = 5 and one of the legs, let's say a, is 3. We need to find the length of the other leg, b. Substituting the given values into the equation, we get 5^2 = 3^2 + b^2, which simplifies to 25 = 9 + b^2. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us b^2 = 16. Taking the square root of both sides, we get b = 4. Therefore, the length of the other leg is 4 units.",

In this case, we know the length of one leg (a = 3) and the hypotenuse (c = 5), so we can plug these values into the equation and solve for the length of the other leg (b). First, we square the lengths of the known sides: c^2 = 5^2 = 25, and a^2 = 3^2 = 9. Then, we rearrange the equation to isolate b^2: b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 25 - 9 = 16. Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg: b = sqrt(16) = 4.",
            "Solution: Using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides, we can solve for the length of the unknown leg. The theorem is represented by the equation: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. Given that one leg (a) is 3 units and the hypotenuse (c) is 5 units, we can plug these values into the equation to solve for the unknown leg (b). Therefore, 3^2 + b^2 = 5^2. Simplifying the equation, we get 9 + b^2 = 25. Next, we isolate b^2 by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, resulting in b^2 = 16. To find the value of b, we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Therefore, b = \u221a16, which simplifies to b = 4. Hence, the length of the other leg is 4 units."
