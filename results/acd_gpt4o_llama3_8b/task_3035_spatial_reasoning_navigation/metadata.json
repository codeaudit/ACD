This requires advanced spatial reasoning, visual imagination, and comprehension capabilities. \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Task Complexity**: The task involves understanding spatial relationships from a textual description and then converting that understanding into a set of coherent directions. This type of spatial reasoning is generally considered difficult, even for humans.\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Most current LLMs are strong in language comprehension and generation. However, spatial reasoning, especially when it requires creating a mental map and navigating through it, is more challenging. It is not typically a core strength of LLMs.\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to evaluate the correctness of the directions based on predefined criteria. While using another LLM to judge can be problematic due to potential biases and inaccuracies, it can still be a reasonable approach if the criteria are well-defined and the LLM judge is robust.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that spatial reasoning and visual imagination are not the primary strengths of LLMs, and considering the difficulty of the task for humans, the agent's success in this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
