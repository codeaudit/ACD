This requires a deep understanding of both natural language and formal logic notation.\n- **Capabilities Measured:** Logical reasoning and formal language understanding are necessary. Current LLMs have demonstrated capabilities in understanding and generating both natural language and formal languages (e.g., programming languages).\n- **Human Difficulty:** The task is described as difficult, which implies that even humans may struggle with it, especially if they are not familiar with symbolic logic.\n- **Agent Success:** The LLM succeeded in converting a complex natural language statement into symbolic logic.\n\n**Code Implementation Check:**\n- The `get_instructions` method correctly generates the instructions for either converting natural language to symbolic logic or vice versa.\n- The `score` method relies on an `eval_with_llm_judge` function to validate the submission against specific criteria. This method appears suitable for evaluating the logical and grammatical correctness of the task.\n\nGiven the capabilities of current LLMs, while the task is challenging, it is not beyond their capabilities to understand and generate both natural language and formal symbolic logic expressions. LLMs are known to perform well in structured language tasks when the domain and rules are clear.\n\n**Decision: No**"
