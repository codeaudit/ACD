Here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Complexity and Constraints**: The task involves multiple constraints (e.g., unit types, movement ranges, terrain features) and requires a coherent and detailed strategy considering these constraints. This level of complexity is challenging, even for advanced LLMs.\n\n2. **Scenario Simulation and Planning**: The task demands simulating a dynamic scenario and formulating a step-by-step plan to achieve a specific objective. This requires the LLM to not only understand the scenario but also predict and plan future actions over multiple turns, which is a sophisticated form of reasoning.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring method uses another LLM to judge the submission against detailed criteria. While LLMs have shown proficiency in evaluating text based on criteria, the complexity of strategic planning might pose challenges for accurate evaluation.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is marked as \"difficult,\" suggesting that the task is non-trivial and requires significant cognitive effort even from human experts.\n\nGiven these factors, an LLM's success in this task would be surprising and noteworthy because it demonstrates an advanced level of strategic reasoning and coherent planning, which are beyond basic language modeling capabilities. Conversely, failure would be less surprising given the complexity involved.\n\nDecision: Yes"
