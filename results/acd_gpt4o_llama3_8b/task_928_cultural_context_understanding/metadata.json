            "Explanation: In Japanese culture, giving a sharp object as a gift is considered bad luck because the word for \"sharp object\" is a homophone for the word for \"regret\" or \"grief\". This linguistic similarity is thought to signify that the gift of a sharp object would bring the recipient regret or grief. To offset this negative connotation, the traditional practice is to give a coin in return, which is believed to counterbalance the bad luck and create a more positive energy.",
            "Explanation: This cultural reference is based on a Japanese superstition, where giving a sharp object, such as a knife or scissors, as a gift is believed to bring bad luck. This is because the word for \"knife\" in Japanese, \"yaiba\", sounds similar to the word \"yabai\", which means \"bad luck\" or \"trouble\". To counteract this bad luck, the receiver is expected to give a coin to the giver, symbolizing the reversal of fortune. This practice is rooted in the country's ancient belief in the importance of balance and reciprocity in social relationships.",
            "Explanation: In Japanese culture, giving a sharp object as a gift is considered bad luck because it is believed to bring evil spirits or misfortune to the recipient. This is rooted in the idea that sharp objects, such as knives or scissors, can be used to harm or cut ties with others. To counteract this negative energy, the receiver is expected to give a coin in return, which symbolizes good fortune and a way to \"cut\" the negative energy and replace it with positivity. This custom is often seen in the practice of \"Sakana no Tsukai,\" where a coin is given to the host or recipient as a way to show appreciation and gratitude, while also warding off bad luck.",
            "Explanation: In Japan, giving a sharp object as a gift is considered bad luck because it's believed to symbolize a cutting or severing of relationships. This is rooted in the country's cultural emphasis on harmony and avoiding conflict. By requiring the receiver to give a coin in return, the giver is able to \"pay\" for the object and thereby avoid any potential negative consequences. This custom reflects the importance of maintaining social balance and avoiding any actions that might be perceived as confrontational or divisive.",
            "Explanation: In Japan, giving a sharp object as a gift is considered bad luck because it's believed to bring harm or injury to the recipient. This superstition is rooted in the idea that a sharp object can cause physical harm, and by giving it as a gift, the giver is essentially wishing harm upon the recipient. To counteract this bad luck, the receiver is expected to give a coin in return, which is thought to absorb the negative energy and bring good fortune. This custom is a way of showing respect and care for the recipient's well-being, and is an important aspect of Japanese gift-giving etiquette."

            "Explanation: In Spain, the tradition of eating 12 grapes at midnight on New Year's Eve is a long-standing custom known as \"Las Doce Uvas de la Suerte\" (The Twelve Grapes of Luck). According to legend, if one eats 12 grapes, one for each stroke of the clock at midnight, they will have good luck for the upcoming year.
