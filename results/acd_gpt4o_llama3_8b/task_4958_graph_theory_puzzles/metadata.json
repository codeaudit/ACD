            "To find the shortest path in the graph from the start node 'A' to the end node 'G', I will use Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm works by maintaining a list of unvisited nodes and their distances from the start node. It iteratively selects the node with the minimum distance, updates the distances of its neighbors, and marks it as visited.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the distances of all nodes to infinity, except for the start node 'A', which is set to 0.\n2. Create a list of unvisited nodes and add all nodes to it.\n3. Select the node with the minimum distance from the unvisited list (which is 'A' initially).\n4. For each neighbor of the selected node, update its distance if a shorter path is found.\n5. Mark the selected node as visited and remove it from the unvisited list.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the end node 'G' is visited.\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, I find the shortest path from 'A' to 'G' as follows:\n\n- The shortest path from 'A' to 'C' is 'A' -> 'C' with a distance of 4.\n- The shortest path from 'C' to 'D' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'D' with a distance of 6.\n- The shortest path from 'D' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'D' -> 'G' with a distance of 9.\n- The shortest path from 'C' to 'F' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'F' with a distance of 9.\n- The shortest path from 'F' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'F' -> 'G' with a distance of 10.\n- The shortest path from 'B' to 'E' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'E' with a distance of 7.\n- The shortest path from 'E' to 'F' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'E' -> 'F' with a distance of 9.\n- The shortest path from 'E' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'E' -> 'G' with a distance of 11.\n- The shortest path from 'B' to 'C' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'C' with a distance of 4.\n- The shortest path from 'B' to 'E' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'E' with a distance of 7.\n- The shortest path from 'B' to 'F' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'F' with a distance of 9.\n- The shortest path from 'B' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'B' -> 'G' with a distance of 10.\n- The shortest path from 'C' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'G' with a distance of 6.\n- The shortest path from 'D' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'D' -> 'G' with a distance of 9.\n- The shortest path from 'E' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'E' -> 'G' with a distance of 10.\n- The shortest path from 'F' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'F' -> 'G' with a distance of 10.\n\nThe shortest path from 'A' to 'G' is 'A' -> 'C' -> 'D' -> 'G' with a distance of 9.\n\nAnswer: Shortest Path: ['A', 'C', 'D', 'G'] with Distance: 9",
            "To solve this problem, I will use Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm finds the shortest path between a start node and an end node in a weighted graph. Here is my plan:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to store the distances from the start node to all other nodes, and a dictionary to store the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes. Initialize the distance to the start node as 0, and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Create a set to store the nodes that have been processed.\n3. While the set of processed nodes does not contain all nodes in the graph, do the following:\n   - Select the node with the smallest distance that has not been processed.\n   - For each neighbor of the selected node that has not been processed, calculate the tentative distance from the start node to the neighbor through the selected node. If this tentative distance is less than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance and the shortest path to the neighbor.\n4. Return the shortest path and distance from the start node to the end node.\n\nNow, let me implement the algorithm and calculate the shortest path and distance.\n\nThe graph is given as nodes and edges, and the start and end nodes are provided. I will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node.\n\nThe nodes and edges are as follows:\n\nNodes: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\nEdges: [('A', 'B', 1), ('B', 'C', 3), ('A', 'C', 4), ('C', 'D', 2), ('D', 'E', 1), ('B', 'E', 6), ('E', 'F', 2), ('C', 'F', 5), ('F', 'G', 1), ('D', 'G', 3)]\n\nThe start node is A, and the end node is G.\n\nNow, let's implement the algorithm.\n\nAnswer: Shortest Path: ['A', 'F', 'G'] with Distance: 2.",
            "To find the shortest path in the graph, I will use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.\n\nFirst, I will create a dictionary to store the distance to each node, initialized with a distance of infinity for all nodes except the start node, which is set to 0. Then, I will create a dictionary to store the previous node in the shortest path to each node.\n\nNext, I will create a set of all unvisited nodes and select the node with the smallest distance. I will then update the distances of the node's neighbors and update the previous node in the shortest path for each neighbor.\n\nI will repeat this process until all nodes have been visited, and the shortest path to the end node will be the path from the start node to the end node through the nodes with the smallest distance.\n\nHere are the steps in Python code:\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the graph\nnodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']\nedges = [('A', 'B', 1), ('B', 'C', 3), ('A', 'C', 4), ('C', 'D', 2), ('D', 'E', 1), ('B', 'E', 6), ('E', 'F', 2), ('C', 'F', 5), ('F', 'G', 1), ('D', 'G', 3)]\n\n# Define the start and end nodes\nstart_node = 'A'\nend_node = 'G'\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the distance to each node\ndistance = {node: sys.maxsize for node in nodes}\ndistance[start_node] = 0\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the previous node in the shortest path to each node\nprevious = {node: None for node in nodes}\n\n# Create a set of all unvisited nodes\nunvisited = set(nodes)\n\n# Select the node with the smallest distance\nwhile unvisited:\n    current_node = min(unvisited, key=lambda node: distance[node])\n\n    # If the current node is the end node, we have found the shortest path\n    if current_node == end_node:\n        break\n\n    # Remove the current node from the unvisited set\n    unvisited.remove(current_node)\n\n    # Update the distances of the current node's neighbors\n    for neighbor, weight in [(node, weight) for node, neighbor, weight in edges if node == current_node]:\n        new_distance = distance[current_node] + weight\n        if new_distance < distance[neighbor]:\n            distance[neighbor] = new_distance\n            previous[neighbor] = current_node\n\n# Build the shortest path\npath = []\ncurrent_node = end_node\nwhile current_node is not None:\n    path.append(current_node)\n    current_node = previous[current_node]\npath.reverse()\n\n# Print the shortest path and distance\nprint(f'Shortest Path: {path} with Distance: {distance[end_node]}')\n```\n\nAnswer: Shortest Path: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'] with Distance: 6",
