A minimum of 21 days of paid leave per year for all employees.\n2. An additional 5 days of paid leave for employees who have completed 5 years of service.\n\nFor the first question, I need to calculate the minimum paid leave entitlements for an employee who has worked for 6 years.\n\nSince the employee has completed 5 years of service, they are entitled to the additional 5 days of paid leave. Therefore, their total paid leave entitlement is 21 days (minimum) + 5 days (additional) = 26 days.\n\nFor the second question, the text does not provide any information about the Property Law or oral lease agreements.

This is generally considered difficult for humans due to the specialized knowledge required.\n\n2. **Capabilities of LLMs**: Modern LLMs have shown a high level of proficiency in natural language understanding and can handle complex tasks involving logical reasoning to some extent. They have also been trained on large corpora, which likely include legal texts, thus they may have some familiarity with legal terminology and concepts.\n\n3. **Specific Requirements**:\n   - **Question 1**: The LLM needs to understand and correctly interpret the Employment Law to determine the minimum paid leave entitlements for an employee who has worked for 6 years.\n   - **Question 2**: The LLM needs to interpret the Property Law to evaluate the legal status of an oral lease agreement for 4 years.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used for scoring, which can be suitable since the criteria are based on accuracy and clarity of the answers.
