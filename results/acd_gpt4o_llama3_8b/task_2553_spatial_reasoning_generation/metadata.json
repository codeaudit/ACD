While LLMs have shown impressive capabilities in language generation, their ability to perform spatial reasoning tasks with high accuracy can be limited.\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation is performed by another LLM using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which can introduce variability and subjectivity in scoring. This method is not as precise as human evaluation, especially in tasks requiring exact pattern matching.\n\nConsidering these factors, the LLM agent's success on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
