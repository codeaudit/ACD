A fascinating domain that can explore this capability is \"turn-based strategy games.\" \n\nIn this task family, the agent will need to make strategic decisions based on a given game state and predefined rules. This will test the model's ability to plan, adapt, and predict outcomes. The task will involve simple strategic board games like Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect Four.

There are no misplaced import statements.\n3. **Evaluation Criteria**: The evaluation criteria have been improved to include the validity of the move and its strategic value. However, we need to ensure these criteria are robust enough to prevent unintended successful scores.\n4. **Clarity of Tasks**: The instructions are clear and now include an example move.\n5. **Response Format**: The response format is specified clearly in the instructions, and an example is provided.\n6. **Ambiguity**: The tasks should be straightforward with the current instructions and rules.\n\nGiven that the agent still scored 0.0, it might be beneficial to further refine the criteria and make sure they are stringent enough.

Opportunities to block the opponent's winning line:\n\t* Horizontal: There are no four O's in a row.\n\t* Vertical: There are no four O's in a column.\n\t* Diagonal: There are no four O's in a diagonal line.\n\nBased on the analysis, I will make a strategic move to create a potential winning line.\n\nI will drop a disc in column 3, which is the middle column. This will give me the opportunity to create a potential winning line in the future.\n\nMy move is: (3, 3)\n\nAnswer: (3, 3)",
            "To determine the best strategic move, I'll need to analyze the current game state and look for potential opportunities. \n\nFrom the given game state, I can see that the player 'X' has a strong presence in the bottom-left corner of the grid, while the player 'O' has a presence in the middle row.\n\nMy plan is to try to block the player 'X' from getting four discs in a row while also trying to create opportunities for player 'O' to win.\n\nLooking at the current state, I notice that 'X' has two potential winning lines:\n- One horizontal line at the bottom row where 'X' has three discs.\n- One vertical line from the bottom-left corner where 'X' has three discs.\n\nMy goal is to block one of these lines while also creating a potential winning line for 'O'.\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I see that if 'O' places their disc in the 2nd column (column index 1), they can create a potential winning line and also block 'X' from getting four discs in a row.\n\nTherefore, my strategic move is:\n\n(4, 1)\n\nThis move creates a potential winning line for 'O' and blocks 'X' from getting four discs in a row.\n\nAnswer: (4, 1)",
            "To make the best strategic move, I will analyze the current game state and look for opportunities to create a potential four-in-a-row or block the opponent's potential four-in-a-row.\n\nThe current game state is:\n             \n      X      \n    O X      \n  X O O      \n  O X X      \nX O X O      \n\nThe opponent (O) has two X's in the second row, and the player (X) has two O's in the third row. The opponent also has a X in the top-left corner.\n\nMy strategy is to focus on blocking the opponent's potential four-in-a-row and creating opportunities for my own four-in-a-row.\n\nI will place my disc (X) in the column where the opponent has a X in the top-left corner. This will block the opponent's potential four-in-a-row and create a potential four-in-a-row for me.\n\nThe move is: (1, 1)\n\nAnswer: (1, 1)",
            "To make the best strategic move, I'll analyze the game state and try to find the most promising column to drop a disc in.\n\nThe current game state is:\n```\n      X      \n    O X      \n  X O O      \n  O X X      \nX O X O      \n```\nI'll start by looking for opportunities to create a row, column, or diagonal of four discs. Since there are no immediate wins, I'll focus on blocking potential threats and creating new opportunities.\n\nAfter analyzing the game state, I notice that the top-left column has an X, and the top-right column has an O. This suggests that the next move should be made in one of these columns to create a potential row or block a potential threat.\n\nConsidering the rules of the game, I'll make a strategic move in the top-left column (column 1) to create a potential row and block a potential threat.\n\nThe best strategic move is:\n(3, 1)\n\nThis move allows me to create a potential row and block a potential threat, while also maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnswer: (3, 1)",
            "To solve this problem, I will analyze the current state of the game and try to identify the best strategic move for the next turn.\n\nThe current state is:\n\n      X      \n    O X      \n  X O O      \n  O X X      \nX O X O      \n\nFrom the current state, we can observe that the player X has a strong presence in the game, controlling the center of the board and having multiple opportunities to create a four-in-a-row. The player O has a few potential threats, but they are not as well-positioned.\n\nBased on this analysis, my plan for the next move is to block a potential winning line for X while also maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nThe potential winning line for X is in the middle column, where X has two discs already placed. If X gets another disc in that column, they will win the game.\n\nTo block this potential winning line, I will place an O in the same column, one row above the existing X discs.\n\nMy strategic move is to place an O in the (3, 2) position, which is one row above the existing X discs in the middle column.\n\nTherefore, my move is (3, 2).\n\nAnswer: (3, 2)"
