            "To approach this task, I will first identify the chords required for the progression and their functions in the key of G major. The chords I, IV, V, and vi are G, C, D, and Em, respectively. A common cadence pattern in pop music often involves a progression that moves from a more stable chord to a less stable one, creating tension, and then resolves back to the stable chord. A suitable progression could be a variation of the I-IV-V-vi pattern.\n\nBreaking down the progression:\n\n1. G (I) - The I chord is the tonic and provides a sense of resolution.\n2. C (IV) - Moving to the IV chord introduces a sense of tension, particularly because C is the relative major of E minor, which is often used as a secondary tonic or a bridge.\n3. D (V) - The V chord is used for its tension and is a common choice for the pre-dominant chord in many pop songs, as it creates a sense of anticipation.\n4. Em (vi) - The vi chord is a minor chord often used for its ability to add depth and a touch of melancholy or surprise in a progression.\n\nA common pattern for pop songs often follows an AABB scheme or an ABAB pattern for the progression, where A and B represent the groups of two bars. To maintain a common cadence, I'll keep the progression in an ABAB pattern but slightly rearrange the progression to fit the I-IV-V-vi pattern while also adding a sense of progression and resolution.\n\nThe composition, adhering to the key of G major and using the specified chords, could look like this:\n\nComposition: G - C - D - Em\n\nThis progression can be repeated to create a structure for a song, with each iteration potentially offering a fresh start and new musical ideas. This is a simplified approach and can be expanded upon with the introduction of other chords or melodies to create a full song.\n\nAnswer: G - C - D - Em",

This involves creativity, knowledge of music theory, and structured composition. Human difficulty is rated as \"difficult,\" which suggests that it is a non-trivial task, particularly because it involves specific constraints and adherence to music theory rules.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in generating text based on structured prompts, and some have shown capabilities in generating code or other structured outputs. However, generating coherent and theoretically sound musical compositions, especially within specific constraints, is a higher bar due to the need for specialized knowledge and creativity.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which checks for adherence to constraints, correct notation, and musical coherence. Assuming this evaluation method is robust, it should fairly assess the generated compositions.\n\n4. **Surprise Factor**: Given the complexity of music composition and the specific constraints, an LLM succeeding at this task is noteworthy. While LLMs are good at generating text, generating a musically coherent piece that adheres strictly to music theory constraints is a more specialized skill. The success implies that the LLM has a significant understanding of music theory and can apply it creatively within given constraints.\n\nDecision: Yes"
