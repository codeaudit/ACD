            "content": "Given the task family \"complex_math_problem,\" I will evaluate the LLM's success in solving complex multi-step mathematical problems.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Task Complexity:** The task involves solving a multi-step mathematical problem that requires understanding and applying algebraic concepts. For instance, finding the dimensions of a rectangular garden based on provided conditions.\n2. **LLM Capabilities:** LLMs are generally proficient at natural language understanding and generating text. However, complex mathematical reasoning is a more challenging domain for LLMs. While LLMs have shown some ability to solve simpler mathematical problems, multi-step problems that require logical structuring, intermediate steps, and correct final answers are particularly difficult.\n3. **Scoring Mechanism:** The scoring method relies on `eval_with_llm_judge`, which uses another LLM to evaluate the solution based on specified criteria. Given that LLM judges may not always accurately assess the correctness of mathematical solutions, there may be concerns regarding the reliability of the evaluation.\n4. **Human Difficulty:** The task is marked as \"very difficult\" for humans, indicating a high level of complexity.\n\nConsidering these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would be surprising because:\n- The task complexity is high, involving multiple steps and requiring precise logical reasoning.\n- LLMs typically struggle with maintaining accuracy over multiple steps in complex mathematical problems.\n\n**Decision:** Yes"
