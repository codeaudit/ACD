However, LLMs have been shown to handle such tasks relatively well.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The task uses `eval_with_llm_judge` to automatically score the generated documentation against set criteria. This method is generally reliable for assessing text quality and adherence to specific requirements.\n\nConsidering the above points, the success of an LLM agent in generating technical documentation based on code snippets or descriptions is consistent with its known capabilities.
