The document clearly states the timing of rent payment, which is the first day of each month. \n2. Before subleasing the property, the document requires the Tenant to obtain prior written consent from the Landlord.\n3. Since the document does not mention the process or requirement for subleasing, but explicitly states a necessity for written consent from the Landlord, it's safe to deduce that obtaining consent is the necessary action before proceeding with subleasing.\n\nHere are the answers in the required format:\n\n1. The Tenant is required to pay rent on the first day of each month.\n2. The Tenant must obtain prior written consent from the Landlord before subleasing the property.",
