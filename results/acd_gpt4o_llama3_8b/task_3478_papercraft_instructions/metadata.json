Fold the top and bottom edges of the paper inwards, making sure they are even and symmetrical.\n9. Take the top layer of the paper and fold it back, creating a small triangle shape. Repeat this with the bottom layer.\n10. You should see the neck of the crane starting to form. Take the top layer of the paper and fold it back, creating a small triangle shape, but this time, tuck it under the neck.\n11. Take the two wings of the crane and fold them inwards, making sure they are even and symmetrical.\n12. Take the tail of the crane and fold it inwards, making sure it is even and symmetrical.\n13. Your Origami Crane is now complete. Gently pull out the neck and wings to create a 3D shape, and your model should be ready.\n\nNote: Be patient and gentle when handling the paper, as Origami can be delicate."
