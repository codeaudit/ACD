While LLMs can be good at generating text, their ability to critically and accurately judge practical and actionable plans might be limited compared to human judgment.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Human Difficulty**: The task is rated as difficult for humans, indicating it requires expertise and nuanced understanding.\n- **LLM Judge**: The reliability of using an LLM to evaluate another LLM's output might introduce bias or inaccuracies. The LLM judge might not fully capture the practical value or feasibility of the proposed plan.\n\n### Decision:\nConsidering that modern LLMs are generally capable of generating coherent advice but that the task is complex and difficult for humans, the success of the LLM agent is somewhat expected. However, the use of an LLM judge to evaluate practical effectiveness and detailed planning is not ideal and could affect the credibility of the evaluation.\n\n**Decision: No**"
