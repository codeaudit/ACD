            "Idiom: 'Ride the wave'\n\nExplanation: This idiom means to adapt and go with the flow of a challenging situation, rather than resisting or fighting against it. It is often used to encourage people to be flexible and resilient in the face of adversity. For example, if someone loses their job, they might be told to \"ride the wave\" and look for new opportunities, rather than getting bogged down in negative emotions. The phrase likely originated from surfing, where riders use the momentum of a wave to glide smoothly across the water, symbolizing the ability to navigate and overcome obstacles. In many Western cultures, this idiom is commonly used in business and personal contexts to promote a sense of adaptability and determination.",
            "Idiom: 'Bend the wind'\nExplanation: This idiom means to adapt to changing circumstances or to find a way to overcome obstacles. It is often used in situations where someone is facing a difficult challenge or unexpected setback, and they need to be flexible and resourceful to find a solution. The phrase likely originated from the idea of bending a tree branch to redirect the wind, symbolizing the ability to adjust to external forces and find a way forward. In cultural and historical context, the idiom may be related to the concept of \"wa\" in Japanese philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability in the face of change. The idiom is commonly used in everyday conversation, particularly in business and professional settings, to encourage people to think creatively and find solutions to complex problems.",
            "Idiom: 'Bite off more than you can chew'\n\nExplanation: This idiom means to take on more responsibility or tasks than one is capable of handling. It is often used to caution against overcommitting oneself or taking on too much at once. The phrase is thought to have originated from the idea of biting into a piece of food that is too large to chew, symbolizing the struggle to handle an overwhelming workload or task. In modern usage, it is commonly used in everyday conversation to advise someone against overextending themselves or to express concern that they may be in over their head.",
            "Idiom: 'Bite off more than you can chew'\n\nExplanation: This idiom means to take on more responsibilities or tasks than one can handle. It is often used to caution someone against overcommitting themselves, either in their personal or professional life. The phrase is thought to have originated from the literal act of biting into a piece of food that is too large to chew, causing discomfort or difficulty. In a figurative sense, it means to overestimate one's abilities or take on more than one can reasonably manage. This idiom is commonly used in everyday conversation, particularly in situations where someone is considering a new project or commitment that may be too ambitious or overwhelming.\n\nIt is worth noting that this idiom is often used in a lighthearted or humorous tone, and is not typically used in formal or professional settings. However, it can be a useful way to offer advice or words of caution to someone who may be taking on too much.",

            "Proverb: \"La prisa es el diablo del trabajo.\"\n\nExplanation: This proverb translates to \"Haste is the devil of work,\" and it means that rushing or being in a hurry can lead to mistakes, errors, and overall poor quality of work. In Spanish culture, this phrase is often used to caution people against rushing through tasks, emphasizing the importance of taking one's time, being thorough, and doing things correctly. \n\nThe phrase is commonly used in various contexts, such as in the workplace, in education, or even in personal projects. It serves as a reminder that shortcuts or hasty decisions can have negative consequences, and that patience and attention to detail are essential for success. \n\nIn some Latin American countries, this proverb is also associated with the idea that \"mal puede empezar bien lo que se hace apresuradamente\" (bad things can start to happen when things are done in a hurry). This phrase highlights the potential risks of rushing, making it a valuable warning to take a step back, reassess priorities, and approach tasks with a calm and focused mindset.",
            "Proverb: \"Un elefante no se derrumba solo.\"\n\nExplanation: This Spanish proverb translates to \"An elephant doesn't fall over alone.\" It means that a person who is struggling or on the verge of failure will not be able to do so without the help or contribution of others. This phrase is often used to convey that no one person is an island, and that the circumstances that lead to failure are often a result of a combination of individual and external factors.\n\nThe phrase is commonly used in Spain and Latin America, particularly in social and business contexts, to express that setbacks or failures are rarely the result of a single person's actions, but rather a complex interplay of factors. This proverb encourages people to take responsibility for their actions, but also acknowledges that circumstances can be beyond one's control.\n\nIn a broader cultural context, this proverb reflects the collectivist values prevalent in Spanish-speaking cultures, where the community and social relationships are highly valued. It suggests that individual success or failure is not solely dependent on personal effort, but also on the support and influence of others. This phrase is often used to encourage collaboration, empathy, and understanding, rather than placing blame or guilt on a single individual.",
            "Proverb: \"A casa ajena no se ven los clavos.\"\n\nExplanation: This proverb is a common Spanish saying that translates to \"You don't see the nails in a neighbor's house.\" It means that you shouldn't be too quick to point out the flaws or mistakes of others, especially when they are not your own. The phrase is often used to advise people to be humble and avoid criticizing or judging others, even if you see flaws or imperfections.\n\nThe proverb is thought to have originated from the medieval practice of nailing wooden beams together in a house. The phrase is a reminder that you don't see the nails that hold the beams together from the outside, just as you don't see the mistakes or imperfections of others from the outside. It's a reminder to be empathetic and not to judge others too harshly.\n\nIn everyday conversation, this phrase is often used in situations where someone is pointing out the flaws of a friend, family member, or colleague. A friend might say, \"No te preocupes por eso, a casa ajena no se ven los clavos\" (Don't worry about that, you don't see the nails in a neighbor's house), to remind the person not to be too critical. It's a way of encouraging self-reflection and kindness towards others.",
            "Proverb: El que sembr\u00f3 vientos, que espera tempestades.\n\nExplanation: This proverb is a common saying in Spanish, meaning \"Those who sow the winds, shall reap the whirlwinds.\" It is often used to convey that one's actions will ultimately lead to their own downfall or suffering. The phrase is thought to have originated from a biblical passage in the book of Hosea, where it says \"What a wind hath sown shall a whirlwind reap\" (Hosea 8:7). However, the modern Spanish phrase is more idiomatic and universally understood.\n\nIn everyday usage, this proverb is often used to caution people against engaging in reckless behavior, making impulsive decisions, or acting in ways that may seem convenient or advantageous at the moment but ultimately lead to negative consequences. For example, if someone has been spreading rumors or lies about someone else, and those actions ultimately lead to their downfall, someone might say \"Es un ejemplo de que el que sembr\u00f3 vientos, que espera tempestades\" (\"It's a perfect example of those who sow the winds, shall reap the whirlwinds\").\n\nCulturally, this proverb reflects a strong value placed on personal responsibility and accountability in Spanish-speaking cultures. It suggests that individuals must take ownership of their actions and their consequences, and that one's behavior ultimately determines one's outcomes in life. Historically, this proverb has been used in various contexts, including politics, business, and personal relationships, to remind people of the importance of considering the long-term effects of their actions.\n\nIn terms of cultural significance, this proverb has been a staple of Spanish language and culture for centuries, and its popularity endures to this day. It is widely recognized and used across different countries and regions, including Spain, Latin America, and the United States, where Spanish is spoken.",
            "Proverb: \"El que se arrima a la pared, se moja los pantalones\"\n\nExplanation: This proverb is a common saying in Spanish that translates to \"The one who leans against the wall gets wet pants.\" The phrase is used to caution against being too cautious or hesitant, as it may lead to missing out on opportunities or being left behind. The image is that of someone standing too close to a wet wall, literally getting their pants wet in the process. In a broader sense, the proverb advises against being too afraid to take risks or venture out of your comfort zone, lest you miss the chance to achieve your goals or make progress. The phrase has cultural and historical significance, as it reflects the Spanish values of resilience and adaptability. It is often used to encourage people to be more proactive and confident in their pursuits, rather than holding back due to fear of failure or uncertainty."
