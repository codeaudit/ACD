Shuffle the deck of mission cards and place it within reach of all players.\n3. Each player chooses a spaceship and places it on the starting planet on the board, as indicated by the game board's layout.\n4. Determine the starting player randomly, either by drawing a card or by a predetermined method.\n5. Each player receives a set of resources, including 5 units of fuel, 3 units of oxygen, and 2 units of spare parts.\n6. The remaining resources are placed in designated areas on the board, and the planets are arranged randomly around the starting planet.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe game is played over a series of turns, with each turn consisting of several phases:\n1. Player Turn: The starting player begins their turn by drawing a mission card from the deck and reading it aloud. The mission card will specify the planet to be visited, the resources required to complete the mission, and the points awarded upon completion.\n2. Resource Management: The player must manage their resources to complete the mission. They can move their spaceship to a nearby planet, gather resources from that planet, and use those resources to complete the mission.\n3. Resource Gathering: If the player needs resources to complete the mission, they can visit a planet to gather them. The player can move their spaceship to the planet, and then draw a resource card from the planet's resource pool. The resource card will specify the type and quantity of resources available.\n4. Mission Completion: If the player has the required resources, they can complete the mission by resolving the mission's effects. The player earns the points specified on the mission card, and the mission card is discarded.\n5. Resource Exhaustion: If a player's resources fall to 0, they must return to the starting planet to replenish their resources.\n6. Turn End: The player's turn ends, and the next player in sequence begins their turn.\n\nWinning Conditions:\nThe game ends when all mission cards have been completed or when a player's resources fall to 0. To determine the winner, calculate the total points earned by each player. The player with the most points wins the game. In the event of a tie, the player with the most completed missions wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the most resources at the end of the game wins.",

Each player chooses a spaceship card and places it on the starting planet, marked as \"Galactic Hub.\" Shuffle the resource cards and place them face down on designated spaces on the board. Shuffle the mission cards and place them face down on designated spaces on the board. Each player takes turns placing three resource cards from their hand onto the board, choosing a planet to place each card on.\n\nGame Mechanics: \nOn each player's turn, they draw a resource card and resolve any space mission on the current planet. Players can choose to move their spaceship to an adjacent planet, if there is one, or stay on the current planet. If a player chooses to move, they can only land on a planet that is adjacent to their current planet. Players can also choose to complete a mission on the current planet using their resources. If a player completes a mission, they earn points and receive any rewards listed on the mission card. Players can collect resources from the planets they visit. A player's turn ends when they choose to move, complete a mission, or their turn is over.\n\nWinning Conditions: \nThe game ends after all players have used up all their resource cards. The player with the most points wins. Points can be earned by completing missions, and penalties are assigned for not completing missions.

Shuffle the mission deck and draw a set of missions of 3 to be placed on the board. Shuffle the resource deck, placing it within reach of all players. Determine who goes first by the roll of a dice, the highest number goes first.\n\nGame Mechanics: \nOn each player's turn, they roll a dice to determine how many actions they can take. The actions available to a player on their turn are as follows: Move: Move their spaceship to an adjacent unclaimed planet. Explore: Land on an unclaimed planet and draw a resource card, which may have a chance to gather resources. Complete Mission: Choose a mission they have resources to complete and fulfill the mission's requirements to earn points. Gather Resources: Collect resources from the planet they are currently on. Trade Resources: Trade resources they have for other resources with other players. Refuel: Refuel their spaceship with the resources they have. The game ends when one player reaches a total of 500 points or when all planets have been explored and no player can complete any missions. Players earn points for completing missions, the points are as follows: Mining 5 points, Trading 3 points, Exploration 2 points, and Refueling 1 point.\n\nWin!",

Place the resources tokens and mission cards face down on designated spaces on the board. Each player starts with 5 resource tokens of each type (minerals, metals, and gases).\n\nGame Mechanics:\nPlayers take turns in a clockwise direction. On their turn, a player can perform one of the following actions:\n\n1. Move: Move their spaceship to an adjacent planet by rolling a die and adding the spaceship's movement value. If the result equals or exceeds the distance between the current planet and the destination planet, the spaceship lands on the destination planet.\n2. Explore: If a player lands on a planet, they can explore it by drawing a planet card, which reveals the resources available on that planet. The player can collect a set amount of resources from the planet based on the card.\n3. Mission: If a player has a spaceship on a planet with a mission card on it, they can choose to complete the mission by rolling a die and adding the spaceship's mission value. If the result equals or exceeds the mission's difficulty, the player completes the mission and earns the points listed on the card.\n4. Upgrade: If a player has resources, they can use them to upgrade their spaceship's movement or mission values by purchasing upgrades from the resource market.\n5. Trade: Players can trade resources with each other by offering a combination of resources in exchange for the resources they need.\n\nThe sequence of play continues until one player has completed a set number of missions (determined by the number of players) or a predetermined time limit is reached. Each player earns points for completed missions and resources collected. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nWinning Conditions:\nThe game ends when a predetermined time limit is reached or a set number of missions have been completed. The player with the most points, earned from completed missions and resources collected, is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the player with the most resources wins.

Determine the starting player randomly.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe game is played in rounds, with each player taking individual turns. On their turn, a player can perform two actions: move their spaceship to a neighboring planet, collect resources from a planet they are already on, or attempt to complete a mission. To move their spaceship, a player must spend 1 resource of their choice from their hand. They can then land on a neighboring planet and collect resources (if available). Alternatively, they can choose to complete a mission if they have the required resources and meet the mission's conditions. Mission completion earns the player points and additional resources.\n\nPlayers can also choose to refuel their spaceship by collecting resources from a planet they are currently on. Each planet has a specific resource type and quantity, which is listed on the planet's space on the board. Resources are collected and stored in the player's hand.\n\nThe game ends when the mission deck is depleted or all planets have been explored. Players then tally their points, which are earned by completing missions and collecting resources. The player with the highest total points at the end of the game wins.\n\nWinning Conditions:\nThe game ends when one of the following conditions is met:\n- The mission deck is depleted.\n- All planets have been explored.\n- A player reaches a total of 50 points.\nThe player with the most points is declared the winner.

The board features a map of the kingdom with various locations marked, such as forests, mountains, and rivers.\n2. Shuffle the castle cards and deal 5 cards to each player. These cards will serve as the players' starting castles, which they will use to build and upgrade their kingdoms.\n3. Each player chooses a starting castle card and places it at the edge of the board, marking the location where their kingdom will begin.\n4. Shuffle the quest cards and deal 2 cards to each player. These cards will represent the initial quests that players can send their knights on.\n5. Determine the starting player randomly. The player with the highest castle rating (listed on the castle card) goes first.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe game is played over a series of turns, with each turn consisting of two phases: Action and Resolution.\n\nAction Phase:\n1. On their turn, the player can choose one of the following actions:\n\t* Build: Construct a new castle or upgrade an existing one using resources (gold, wood, and stone) gathered from previous turns.\n\t* Quest: Send a knight on a quest from one of the player's castles to a location on the board.\n\t* Rest: Take no action and wait for the next turn.\n2. If a player chooses to Build, they can use resources to construct a new castle or upgrade an existing one. The resources required for building or upgrading are listed on the castle card.\n3. If a player chooses to Quest, they draw a quest card and read it aloud. The quest will specify the location, obstacles, and rewards for the quest.\n4. The player then sends a knight on the quest by placing it at the starting location on the board. The knight's movement is determined by the type of terrain and any obstacles on the board.\n\nResolution Phase:\n1. The player resolves the quest by rolling a dice to determine the outcome. The roll is modified by the knight's strength (listed on the knight card) and any abilities or bonuses from the quest card.\n2. If the roll is successful, the player gains the treasure specified on the quest card and can bring it back to their kingdom.\n3. If the roll is unsuccessful, the knight is defeated, and the player loses a knight.\n4. The player then discards any spent resources, including resources used for building or upgrading castles and resources collected as rewards.\n\nWinning Conditions:\nThe game ends when all players have used up all their starting castle cards or when a player reaches a predetermined number of treasures (5). The player with the most powerful kingdom, determined by the following ranking:\n\t* Castle rating: 1-3 (low-mid), 4-6 (mid-high), 7-10 (high)\n\t* Number of treasures collected\n\t* Number of knights still alive\n\nThe player with the highest combined ranking wins the game.

This castle serves as the player's home base and starting point for building their kingdom.\n4. Shuffle the knight cards and deal 2 to each player. These knight cards represent the units that players will send on quests to collect treasures.\n5. Each player chooses a starting knight card and places it on the board near their castle. This knight is ready to embark on its first quest.\n6. Shuffle the treasure cards and place them face down on designated locations on the board. These treasures represent the valuable items that knights can collect on their quests.\n7. Determine the starting player randomly.\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe game is played over a series of rounds, with each round representing a turn in the medieval kingdom. The sequence of play is as follows:\n\n1. On each player's turn, they can perform one of the following actions:\n\t* Build a new castle: The player can build a new castle on the board by playing a castle card from their hand. The castle card must match the location on the board where the player wants to build.\n\t* Upgrade a castle: The player can upgrade an existing castle by playing a castle card from their hand that has a higher level than the existing castle.\n\t* Send a knight on a quest: The player can send a knight on a quest by playing a knight card from their hand. The knight can travel to a location on the board where a treasure is located.\n\t* Collect a treasure: If a knight reaches a location on the board where a treasure is located, the player can collect the treasure by playing the treasure card from the board.\n2. After a player has taken their turn, the next player to the left takes their turn.\n3. Players can only have a maximum of 5 knights on quests at any given time. If a player has more than 5 knights on quests, they must return the excess knights to their castle.\n4. Knights can only be sent on quests to locations that are within their movement range.

To determine the winner, calculate the total points of each player's kingdom, including their castle's level, knight levels, and treasure points. The player with the most points wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest castle level wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the most treasure points wins."

This requires a substantial level of logical reasoning, comprehensive understanding, and rule generation capabilities. The task is marked as \"very difficult\" for humans, indicating that it is a complex task requiring detailed and logically consistent output.\n\nLLMs, particularly advanced ones, have shown capabilities in generating coherent and logically consistent text, including instructional content. However, the complexity of creating an entirely new set of procedural rules for a board game and ensuring they are clear, logically consistent, and comprehensive is a significant challenge. It involves not just language generation but also a deep understanding of game mechanics and logical structuring of rules.\n\nThe task is scored by an LLM judge, which compares the generated instructions against criteria such as clarity, completeness, logical consistency, and coherence. Given the difficulty of the task and the high standards for a successful output, an LLM successfully completing this task is indeed noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
