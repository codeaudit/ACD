(5 factorial), which is the number of ways to arrange 5 people in a line.

            "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a complete graph. A complete graph is a graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In other words, there is an edge between every pair of vertices.\n\nFor a graph with n vertices, we can calculate the number of edges by considering the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from the set of n vertices and forming an edge between them. This is a combination problem, as the order of the vertices does not matter.\n\nThe formula for combinations is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nIn this case, we want to choose 2 vertices from a set of n vertices, so we use the combination formula with k=2:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n-2)!)\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factors:\n\nC(n, 2) = (n * (n-1)) / (2 * 1)\n\nThis is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from a set of n vertices, and it represents the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices.\n\nFor the specific case of a graph with 6 vertices, we can plug in n=6 into the formula:\n\nC(6, 2) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1)\n= 30 / 2\n= 15\n\nTherefore, a graph with 6 vertices where each vertex is connected to every other vertex has 15 edges.\n\nThe general formula for any complete graph with n vertices is:\n\nC(n, 2) = (n * (n-1)) / (2 * 1)\n= n * (n-1) / 2\n\nAnswer: 15",
            "Explanation: \nTo solve this problem, we first need to understand what type of graph we are dealing with. Since each vertex is connected to every other vertex, this is a complete graph. \n\nA complete graph with n vertices is denoted as K_n. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. \n\nTo find the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nThe sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. This represents the total number of possible edges between any two vertices. However, each edge is counted twice, once for each vertex it connects. Therefore, we need to divide this sum by 2 to get the actual number of edges in the graph. \n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is n*(n-1)/2. \n\nLet's apply this formula to the given graph with 6 vertices. Plugging in n = 6 into the formula, we get:\n\n6*(6-1)/2 = 6*5/2 = 30/2 = 15\n\nTherefore, the graph with 6 vertices has 15 edges.\n\nGeneralizing this formula for any complete graph with n vertices, we get the formula n*(n-1)/2.\n\nAnswer: 15\nExplanation: A complete graph with 6 vertices has 15 edges. The number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is given by the formula n*(n-1)/2.",
            "To solve this problem, I'll first reason about the problem and then provide a plan for finding the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of edges in a graph with 6 vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. This type of graph is known as a complete graph, where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex.\n\nThe plan for solving the problem is as follows:\n\n1. Identify the type of graph: This is a complete graph, denoted as Kn, where n is the number of vertices.\n2. Recall the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph: The number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is given by the formula: E = n(n-1)/2\n3. Apply the formula to the given problem: Substitute n = 6 into the formula to find the number of edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's calculate the solution:\n\nE = n(n-1)/2\n= 6(6-1)/2\n= 6(5)/2\n= 30/2\n= 15\n\nTherefore, the number of edges in the graph with 6 vertices is 15.\n\nExplanation: The formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is E = n(n-1)/2. This formula is derived from the fact that each vertex is connected to every other vertex, resulting in n-1 edges per vertex. Since there are n vertices, the total number of edges is the sum of the number of edges per vertex, which is n(n-1)/2.\n\nAnswer: 15",
            "Explanation: \n\nA complete graph is a graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a graph with n vertices, each vertex is connected to (n-1) other vertices, since it is not connected to itself. Therefore, each vertex has n-1 edges connected to it.\n\nSince there are n vertices, and each vertex has n-1 edges connected to it, we might initially think that the total number of edges is n(n-1). However, this counts each edge twice, since each edge is shared by two vertices. To correct this, we divide by 2.\n\nThe formula for the number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is given by the combination formula C(n,2), which is equal to n(n-1)/2.\n\nApplying this formula to our specific case, where n = 6, we get the number of edges in the graph as 6(6-1)/2 = 15.\n\nAnswer: 15",
            "To solve this problem, I will use the concept of combinations.\n\nThe graph described is known as a complete graph, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a complete graph with n vertices, each vertex is connected to (n-1) other vertices, and since there are n vertices, the total number of connections can be calculated by combining n vertices taken 2 at a time.\n\nThe formula for combinations, also known as the binomial coefficient, is given by:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!]\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose at a time.\n\nIn the case of a complete graph, we want to choose 2 vertices at a time to connect them. So, we use the formula with n=6 (the number of vertices) and k=2:\n\nC(6, 2) = 6! / [2!(6-2)!]\n\nExpanding the factorials:\n6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\n2! = 2 * 1 = 2\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n\nNow, plug in the values:\nC(6, 2) = 720 / (2 * 24)\n          = 720 / 48\n          = 15\n\nTherefore, a complete graph with 6 vertices has 15 edges.\n\nFor a complete graph with n vertices, we can use the same formula to find the number of edges. The general formula is:\n\nC(n, 2) = n! / [2!(n-2)!]\n\nAnswer: 15\nExplanation: The graph is a complete graph with 6 vertices. To find the number of edges, I used the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n=6 and k=2. Simplifying the expression, I got C(6, 2) = 15. This formula can be generalized for a complete graph with n vertices as C(n, 2) = n! / [2!(n-2)!]."
