This requires procedural writing, domain knowledge about cooking, and clarity.\n\n2. **Agent's Capabilities**: LLMs, particularly advanced ones, have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating structured text, such as recipes, based on given instructions. They can understand and adhere to specific requirements like \"gluten-free\" or \"nut-free\" due to their extensive training on diverse textual data, including recipes and dietary information.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The `get_instructions` method provides clear and detailed instructions to the agent, specifying the format and necessary sections of the recipe.\n   - The `score` method uses an `eval_with_llm_judge` function to evaluate the generated recipe against predefined criteria, which include completeness, clarity, adherence to special requirements, and inclusion of special notes.\n\nGiven the above aspects, it seems reasonable to expect that a well-trained LLM should perform well on this task, as it falls within the typical capabilities of such models. The task is moderately challenging but not beyond what LLMs have been shown to handle effectively.\n\n**Decision**: No"
