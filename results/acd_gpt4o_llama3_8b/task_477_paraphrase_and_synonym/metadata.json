Factors may include but are not limited to:\n- Whether sufficient synthetic data has been given in the instructions to challenge the models.\n- Incomplete class definitions, syntax errors, misplaced import statements.\n- Feasibility of the evaluation criteria.\n- Any ambiguity or issues in the clarity of the tasks.\n- The consistency and accuracy of all the fields in the JSON.\n- Whether precisely two entries in `get_tasks` have been defined.\n- Whether agents can get a successful score in an unintended manner.\n- Whether the desired response format for the agent has been given in the instructions.\n- Under no circumstances should the instructions contain the answer or any direct hints leading to the answer. Ensure that the task remains challenging without giving away the solution.\n- If the agent fails at the task, it is OK as long as the task is valid and the agent's failure is due to the difficulty of the task. You are also trying to find surprising failures!\n\nHere is the result of attempting to evaluate the tasks on the given model:\n\"\"\"\nTask run successfully. Agent achieved score: 1.0/1.0\n\"\"\"\n\nIn the next attempt, try and improve on the implementation.\nRespond in the same JSON format as before.\nIf there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous response EXACTLY after the thought and set the \"done\" flag to \"True\".\nDo not set the \"done\" flag to \"True\" if you are still improving the task on the current turn.\nDo not set the \"done\" flag to \"True\" on the final step if there are major issues with the task family."
