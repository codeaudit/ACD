            "Analysis: This chord progression, C - G - Am - F, is a common and popular progression in the key of C major. Let's break down the harmonic functions of each chord and analyze how they interact within the key.\n\nThe key of C major is a tonal key with a major triad as its tonic chord (C major). The tonic chord serves as the central point of reference for the key and is often used as the starting point for chord progressions.\n\nThe first chord in the progression, C, is the tonic chord of the key. As the tonic chord, it provides a sense of stability and finality, and serves as a reference point for the rest of the progression.\n\nThe second chord, G, is a dominant chord in the key of C major. Dominant chords are chords built on the fifth scale degree of a key, and in this case, the fifth scale degree of the key of C major is G. Dominant chords often create a sense of tension that resolves when the progression returns to the tonic chord. In this progression, the G chord creates a sense of tension that will be resolved when the progression returns to the C chord.\n\nThe third chord, Am, is a minor chord built on the sixth scale degree of the key of C major. Minor chords often create a sense of melancholy or introspection, and can add emotional depth to a progression. In this case, the Am chord adds a touch of melancholy to the progression, which will be contrasted with the brighter, more upbeat feel of the G chord.\n\nThe final chord, F, is a subdominant chord in the key of C major. Subdominant chords are chords built on the fourth scale degree of a key, and in this case, the fourth scale degree of the key of C major is F. Subdominant chords often create a sense of forward motion, and can add a sense of progression to a chord progression. In this case, the F chord creates a sense of forward motion that will be resolved when the progression returns to the C chord.\n\nOverall, this chord progression is a classic example of a \"I-V-vi-IV\" progression, which is one of the most common and popular chord progressions in Western music. The progression creates a sense of tension and release, with the G chord creating tension that is resolved when the progression returns to the C chord. The Am chord adds a touch of melancholy, while the F chord creates a sense of forward motion.",
            "Analysis: The given chord progression, C - G - Am - F, is a common and popular progression in the key of C major. Let's analyze the harmonic functions of each chord in this context.\n\nThe key of C major has a tonal center of C, which is the central chord and the tonal center of the progression. The chord C functions as the tonic chord, providing a sense of stability and finality.\n\nThe chord G is a dominant chord, functioning as the V chord in the key of C major. In this role, G creates a sense of tension leading up to the tonic chord C. The G chord is a common choice for the pre-dominant chord in a progression, often leading to the dominant chord (in this case, the V chord) before resolving to the tonic.\n\nThe chord Am is a minor chord, functioning as the vi chord in the key of C major. In this role, Am creates a sense of melancholy or introspection, providing contrast to the brighter, more uplifting quality of the tonic chord C. The Am chord often serves as a pre-dominant chord, leading to the dominant chord (in this case, the V chord) before resolving to the tonic.\n\nThe chord F is a subdominant chord, functioning as the IV chord in the key of C major. In this role, F creates a sense of movement and progression, leading the listener's ear away from the tonic chord and towards the dominant chord. The F chord often serves as a pre-dominant chord, leading to the dominant chord (in this case, the V chord) before resolving to the tonic.\n\nIn the context of the key of C major, these chords interact in the following way: The progression begins with the tonic chord C, establishing the key center. The G chord then creates a sense of tension, leading the listener's ear to anticipate the dominant chord. The Am chord provides contrast and a sense of melancholy, before resolving to the dominant chord F. Finally, the F chord leads the listener's ear back to the tonic chord C, creating a sense of resolution and finality.\n\nThis progression is a classic example of a \"pop\" progression, commonly used in popular music to create a sense of tension and release. The use of the dominant chord (G) and the subdominant chord (F) creates a sense of movement and progression, while the minor chord (Am) provides contrast and adds emotional depth to the progression.",
            "Analysis: This chord progression, consisting of C, G, Am, and F, is rooted in the key of C major. To analyze the harmonic functions of each chord, we'll consider their relationships to the tonic (C), subdominant (F), and relative minor (A minor).\n\nThe progression begins on the tonic chord, C, serving as the foundation of the key. The next chord, G, functions as the dominant chord, establishing a sense of tension that resolves when the progression moves to the next chord. However, in the key of C major, G also serves as the subdominant's dominant, creating a sense of forward motion.\n\nThe Am chord is the relative minor of the key, functioning as the key area's secondary tonal center. This chord is a pivot point in the progression, creating a sense of release after the tension of the dominant chord. Additionally, the Am chord creates a sense of harmonic surprise, as it moves from the tonic's resolution to the relative minor's release.\n\nThe final chord, F, serves as the subdominant, providing a sense of resolution after the release of the Am chord. F is also the dominant of the key's secondary tonal center, G, which makes it a crucial link to the progression's next section.\n\nThe progression resolves by creating a sense of forward motion through the use of dominant progressions (CG), and then a pivot to the key area's secondary tonal center (Am). The progression then resolves again by creating a sense of resolution in the key area's secondary tonal center (CF).",
            "Analysis: The chord progression C - G - Am - F is a common and well-established progression in the key of C major. Analyzing the harmonic functions of each chord, we can observe the following:\n\n- C is the tonic chord, which is the central and most stable chord in the key of C major. It is the home base and serves as the starting point for the progression.\n\n- G is the dominant chord. In the key of C major, G functions as the V chord, creating a sense of tension leading up to the tonic.

In the key of C major, Am serves as the vi chord. The use of a minor chord here adds a touch of melancholy or introspection, which can provide contrast and depth to the progression.\n\n- F is the subdominant chord.

Given this progression, I will aim to create a melody that complements its harmonic structure while adding some interest and musical coherence.\n\n1.  Chord C (Major): For the C chord, I will focus on creating a sense of resolution and stability. This will likely involve using stepwise motion or small leaps within a narrow range.\n2.  Chord G (Major): When moving to the G chord, I will introduce a slightly brighter, more ascending feel to reflect the G's major, uplifting nature. This could involve a leap or a small scale passage.\n3.  Chord Am (Minor): The Am chord will introduce a more melancholic, descending feel, in line with the minor's emotional connotation. I'll aim for a more lyrical, stepwise motion here to create a sense of tension.\n4.  Chord F (Major): Finally, the F chord will provide a sense of surprise or release after the Am chord's tension. It should feel like a resolution, with a sense of upward or outward motion.\n\nHere's a sample melody for the given chord progression:\n\nMelody: C4 - G4 - A4 - G4,  E4 - D4 - C4 - D4,  G4 - F4 - E4 - D4,  E5 - D5 - C5 - B4\n\nExplanation:\n- In the C section, we use a stepwise motion to establish a sense of resolution and stability.\n- When moving to the G section, we introduce a leap to create a more ascending feel.\n- In the Am section, we shift to a more descending, stepwise motion to create a sense of tension.\n- In the F section, we use a mix of stepwise motion and small leaps to create a sense of resolution.\n\nThis is just one possible interpretation of the chord progression, and many other melodies could also fit well.",

This is a common progression in many styles of music, particularly in folk, rock, and pop. The chords have a gentle, introspective feel, with a sense of resolution and finality in the F chord.\n2. Identify the harmonic structure: The progression can be broken down into two main sections:\n\t* C - G: A I-V progression, which is a common and familiar harmonic structure. The C chord is the tonic, and the G chord is the dominant, creating a sense of tension that resolves when the progression returns to C.\n\t* Am - F: A ii-V progression, which is a common harmonic structure in many styles of music. The Am chord is the supertonic, and the F chord is the dominant, creating a sense of tension that resolves when the progression returns to C.\n3. Choose a melody contour: A melody that fits this chord progression should have a gentle, lilting feel. I'll choose a contour that features a mix of stepwise motion and some larger intervals to create a sense of interest and variety.\n4.

            "Analysis: This chord progression, C - G - Am - F, is a common and popular progression in the key of C major. Let's break down the harmonic functions of each chord and analyze how they interact within the key.\n\nThe key of C major is a tonal key with a major triad as its tonic chord (C major). The tonic chord serves as the central point of reference for the key and is often used as the starting point for chord progressions.\n\nThe first chord in the progression, C, is the tonic chord of the key. As the tonic chord, it provides a sense of stability and finality, and serves as a reference point for the rest of the progression.\n\nThe second chord, G, is a dominant chord in the key of C major. Dominant chords are chords built on the fifth scale degree of a key, and in this case, the fifth scale degree of the key of C major is G. Dominant chords often create a sense of tension that resolves when the progression returns to the tonic chord. In this progression, the G chord creates a sense of tension that will be resolved when the progression returns to the C chord.\n\nThe third chord, Am, is a minor chord built on the sixth scale degree of the key of C major. Minor chords often create a sense of melancholy or introspection, and can add emotional depth to a progression. In this case, the Am chord adds a touch of melancholy to the progression, which will be contrasted with the brighter, more upbeat feel of the G chord.\n\nThe final chord, F, is a subdominant chord in the key of C major. Subdominant chords are chords built on the fourth scale degree of a key, and in this case, the fourth scale degree of the key of C major is F. Subdominant chords often create a sense of forward motion, and can add a sense of progression to a chord progression. In this case, the F chord creates a sense of forward motion that will be resolved when the progression returns to the C chord.\n\nOverall, this chord progression is a classic example of a \"I-V-vi-IV\" progression, which is one of the most common and popular chord progressions in Western music. The progression creates a sense of tension and release, with the G chord creating tension that is resolved when the progression returns to the C chord. The Am chord adds a touch of melancholy, while the F chord creates a sense of forward motion.",
            "Analysis: The given chord progression, C - G - Am - F, is a common and popular progression in the key of C major. Let's analyze the harmonic functions of each chord in this context.\n\nThe key of C major has a tonal center of C, which is the central chord and the tonal center of the progression. The chord C functions as the tonic chord, providing a sense of stability and finality.\n\nThe chord G is a dominant chord, functioning as the V chord in the key of C major. In this role, G creates a sense of tension leading up to the tonic chord C. The G chord is a common choice for the pre-dominant chord in a progression, often leading to the dominant chord (in this case, the V chord) before resolving to the tonic.\n\nThe chord Am is a minor chord, functioning as the vi chord in the key of C major. In this role, Am creates a sense of melancholy or introspection, providing contrast to the brighter, more uplifting quality of the tonic chord C. The Am chord often serves as a pre-dominant chord, leading to the dominant chord (in this case, the V chord) before resolving to the tonic.\n\nThe chord F is a subdominant chord, functioning as the IV chord in the key of C major. In this role, F creates a sense of movement and progression, leading the listener's ear away from the tonic chord and towards the dominant chord. The F chord often serves as a pre-dominant chord, leading to the dominant chord (in this case, the V chord) before resolving to the tonic.\n\nIn the context of the key of C major, these chords interact in the following way: The progression begins with the tonic chord C, establishing the key center. The G chord then creates a sense of tension, leading the listener's ear to anticipate the dominant chord. The Am chord provides contrast and a sense of melancholy, before resolving to the dominant chord F. Finally, the F chord leads the listener's ear back to the tonic chord C, creating a sense of resolution and finality.\n\nThis progression is a classic example of a \"pop\" progression, commonly used in popular music to create a sense of tension and release. The use of the dominant chord (G) and the subdominant chord (F) creates a sense of movement and progression, while the minor chord (Am) provides contrast and adds emotional depth to the progression.",
            "Analysis: This chord progression, consisting of C, G, Am, and F, is rooted in the key of C major. To analyze the harmonic functions of each chord, we'll consider their relationships to the tonic (C), subdominant (F), and relative minor (A minor).\n\nThe progression begins on the tonic chord, C, serving as the foundation of the key. The next chord, G, functions as the dominant chord, establishing a sense of tension that resolves when the progression moves to the next chord. However, in the key of C major, G also serves as the subdominant's dominant, creating a sense of forward motion.\n\nThe Am chord is the relative minor of the key, functioning as the key area's secondary tonal center. This chord is a pivot point in the progression, creating a sense of release after the tension of the dominant chord. Additionally, the Am chord creates a sense of harmonic surprise, as it moves from the tonic's resolution to the relative minor's release.\n\nThe final chord, F, serves as the subdominant, providing a sense of resolution after the release of the Am chord. F is also the dominant of the key's secondary tonal center, G, which makes it a crucial link to the progression's next section.\n\nThe progression resolves by creating a sense of forward motion through the use of dominant progressions (CG), and then a pivot to the key area's secondary tonal center (Am). The progression then resolves again by creating a sense of resolution in the key area's secondary tonal center (CF).",

While LLMs are good at generating text, generating musically coherent and creative melodies is a higher bar.\n\n2. **Success Criteria**:\n   - For the analysis, the criteria emphasize accuracy and understanding of harmonic functions.\n   - For the melody generation, the criteria emphasize musical coherence and creativity.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The task uses an LLM judge to evaluate the submissions. This is appropriate for text-based analysis but might be less reliable for evaluating the musical quality of generated melodies. However, since the task explicitly defines criteria for both analysis and melody generation, the LLM judge can still provide a reasonable assessment.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- **Success in Chord Progression Analysis**: Not surprising. LLMs are capable of understanding and explaining music theory concepts based on training data.\n- **Success in Melody Generation**: More surprising. Although LLMs can generate text, creating a melody that fits harmonic structures and is musically coherent is a complex task that goes beyond simple text generation.\n\nSince the task family mentions that the agent succeeded at the task, and considering the difficulty level, the noteworthy part here is the successful generation of a coherent melody. This success indicates a significant capability in the model to handle creative and structured musical tasks.\n\nDecision: Yes"
