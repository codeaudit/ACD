The agent needs to identify conflicts (e.g., overlapping event times) and suggest a new schedule that resolves these conflicts. This requires not just detecting overlaps but also proposing a viable and coherent new schedule.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The `score` method utilizes an `eval_with_llm_judge` function, which validates the submission against criteria such as accurately identifying conflicts and providing a viable new schedule. The success is determined by whether the LLM judge agrees that the submission meets these criteria.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that the task is complex and involves a high level of temporal reasoning, the success of the LLM agent in accurately identifying conflicts and proposing a viable new schedule is noteworthy.
