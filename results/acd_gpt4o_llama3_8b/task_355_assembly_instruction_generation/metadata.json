            "To generate step-by-step assembly instructions for a basic table, I will follow a logical sequence of tasks:\n\n1. Prepare the workspace and gather all necessary tools and parts.\n2. Assemble the legs and attach them to the tabletop.\n3. Use the bolts to secure the legs to the tabletop.\n\nHere are the detailed instructions:\n\nStep 1: Prepare the workspace by clearing a flat area and laying down a protective cloth or mat. Gather all the parts and tools, including the tabletop, 4 legs, 8 bolts, and a wrench.\n\nStep 2: Place the tabletop in the center of the workspace and arrange the 4 legs in a way that they are evenly spaced around the tabletop.\n\nStep 3: Hold a leg in place against the tabletop, ensuring it is aligned with the edge of the tabletop. Use the wrench to screw one of the bolts through the hole on the leg and into the corresponding hole on the tabletop. Tighten the bolt securely, but avoid over-tightening.\n\nStep 4: Repeat Step 3 for the remaining 3 legs, attaching each one to the tabletop using a bolt.\n\nStep 5: Double-check that all legs are securely attached to the tabletop and that the table is stable.\n\nStep 6: Inspect the table for any imperfections or loose parts, and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nStep 7: The basic table assembly is now complete.",
            "To assemble the basic table, I will follow these steps:\n\nFirst, I will reason through the assembly process to determine the necessary steps.\n\n1. Place the tabletop on a flat surface to ensure it is stable and secure for assembly.\n2. Next, I need to attach the legs to the tabletop. Since there are four legs, I will need to attach one to each corner of the tabletop.\n3. To attach the legs, I will need to use the bolts and the wrench. I will start by using the wrench to tighten the bolts to the legs, then attach the legs to the tabletop.\n4. Once all four legs are attached, I will use the wrench to tighten the bolts further to ensure the legs are securely attached to the tabletop.\n5. Finally, I will double-check that the table is stable and all four legs are securely attached to the tabletop.\n\nNow, I will provide the instructions in the required format:\n\nStep 1: Place the tabletop on a flat surface to ensure it is stable and secure for assembly.\nStep 2: Attach one leg to the tabletop using a bolt and the wrench, making sure to tighten the bolt securely.\nStep 3: Repeat Step 2 for the remaining three legs, attaching one leg to each corner of the tabletop.\nStep 4: Use the wrench to tighten the bolts further to ensure the legs are securely attached to the tabletop.\nStep 5: Double-check that the table is stable and all four legs are securely attached to the tabletop.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Place the tabletop on a flat surface to ensure it is stable and secure for assembly.

            "To solve this problem, I will reason about the steps needed to assemble a basic table using the given parts. Here's my thought process:\n\n1. To assemble a table, we need a base, so the legs are essential. \n2. We can attach the legs to the tabletop to create the base.\n3. Since the legs and tabletop are the primary components, we need bolts to secure them together.\n4. We'll need a wrench to tighten the bolts.\n\nWith these steps in mind, here are the assembly instructions:\n\nStep 1: Place the tabletop flat on a work surface to prepare it for assembly.\nStep 2: Attach one leg to the underside of the tabletop using a bolt. Make sure the leg is aligned with the edge of the tabletop and the bolt is secure.\nStep 3: Repeat step 2 for the remaining three legs, spacing them evenly apart to form a square base.\nStep 4: Use the wrench to tighten the bolts securing the legs to the tabletop.\nStep 5: Double-check that all legs are securely attached and the tabletop is level.\n\nAnswer: Step 1: Place the tabletop flat on a work surface to prepare it for assembly.

            "content": "Given the task family \"assembly_instruction_generation,\" the capabilities being measured include spatial reasoning, sequential instruction generation, and descriptive language. This task is estimated to be difficult for humans due to the need for precise and clear instructions that follow a logical sequence.\n\nLLMs, particularly recent advanced ones, are generally capable of generating coherent and logically ordered text. They can understand and follow patterns in instructions and are good at generating detailed, step-by-step content. However, tasks that require spatial reasoning and the ability to visualize the assembly process can be challenging, as these models do not have a physical sense of space or direct experience with assembling objects.\n\nThe agent's success in this task depends on its ability to generate instructions that are not only clear and logically ordered but also correctly use all the listed parts and follow a necessary and sufficient sequence for assembly. The automatic scoring via `eval_with_llm_judge` involves evaluating clarity, logical order, and completeness of the instructions, which LLMs can handle reasonably well.\n\nGiven these considerations, an expert in the field would generally expect a competent LLM to perform well on generating logically ordered and clear instructions for a relatively straightforward task like assembling a simple bookshelf. Therefore, the success of the LLM agent in this task is not particularly surprising.\n\nDecision: No"
