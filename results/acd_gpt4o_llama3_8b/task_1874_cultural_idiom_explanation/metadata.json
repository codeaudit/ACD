It encourages individuals to be proactive and responsible in addressing minor issues before they escalate.\n\nCultural Context: The origin of the phrase is unclear, but it is believed to have been in use in some form since at least the 1600s.

LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, which likely includes many idioms and their explanations. Therefore, they should be able to generate a coherent explanation covering the literal interpretation, figurative meaning, and cultural context of common idioms.\n\nThe use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to score the task also suggests that the evaluation criteria are clear and structured, making it feasible for an LLM to perform well if it has sufficient knowledge and language comprehension capabilities.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM on this task is not particularly surprising.\n\nDecision: No"
