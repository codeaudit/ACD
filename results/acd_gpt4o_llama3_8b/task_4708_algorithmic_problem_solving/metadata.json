            "Algorithm:\nEuclidean Algorithm\n\nExplanation:\nThe Euclidean Algorithm is an efficient method for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Here are the steps involved in the algorithm:\n\n1.  **Input**: Two positive integers, a and b.\n2.  **Step 1**: If b = 0, then the GCD is a.\n3.  **Step 2**: Otherwise, replace a with b, and b with the remainder of a divided by b.\n4.  **Step 3**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until b = 0.\n5.  **Step 4**: At this point, the GCD is a (which was the previous value of b).\n\nThe Euclidean Algorithm works by repeatedly applying the division algorithm to find the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nHere is the algorithm implemented in Python:\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n```\nThis function takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their GCD.\n\nHere is an example of how it works:\n\n```python\nprint(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nAnswer: \ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a",
            "Algorithm:\n1. Function gcd(a, b) {\n2.    While b is not equal to 0:\n3.        a = b\n4.        b = remainder of a divided by b\n5.    End while\n6.    Return a\n7. End function\n\nExplanation:\nThis algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The Euclidean algorithm is a well-known method for finding the GCD of two numbers. It works by repeatedly replacing (a, b) with (b, a mod b) until b is 0, at which point a is the GCD.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm works:\n\n1. The function gcd(a, b) takes two numbers as input.\n2. In the while loop, we repeatedly divide the larger number (a) by the smaller number (b) and update the values of a and b.\n3. In each iteration, we calculate the remainder of a divided by b and assign it to b. This is done using the modulo operator.\n4. We continue this process until b is 0.\n5. Once b is 0, the GCD is the value of a, which is returned by the function.\n6. The function ends and returns the GCD.\n\nAnswer: gcd(a, b) = a",

Replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder.\n7. Repeat steps 5-6 until the smaller number is 0.\n8. Return the larger number as the GCD.\n\nExplanation:\nThis algorithm is based on the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known method for calculating the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The steps involved are:\n\n1. We first check if both numbers are 0, in which case the GCD is 0.\n2. If one of the numbers is 0, we return the other number as the GCD.\n3. If both numbers are equal, we return the number as the GCD.\n4. If one number is 0, we return the other number as the GCD.\n5. We then calculate the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number. This is done using the modulo operator (%).\n6. We replace the larger number with the smaller number, and the smaller number with the remainder.\n7. We repeat steps 5-6 until the smaller number is 0. At this point, the larger number is the GCD.\n8. Finally, we return the larger number as the GCD.\n\nAnswer: The Euclidean algorithm is used to calculate the GCD of two numbers, and it involves repeated division and remainder calculations until the smaller number is 0.",
            "Algorithm:\n1. Define a function to calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. Within the function, use a while loop to repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller number and update the remainder.\n3. Use the remainder as the new smaller number and the old smaller number as the new larger number.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the remainder is 0.\n5. The GCD is the last non-zero remainder.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It works by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number, until the remainder is 0.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. Start by defining a function to calculate the GCD of two numbers, say `num1` and `num2`.\n2. In the function, use a while loop to repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller number and update the remainder.\n3. Use the remainder as the new smaller number and the old smaller number as the new larger number.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the remainder is 0.\n5. At this point, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two original numbers.\n\nFor example, if we want to find the GCD of 48 and 18, the algorithm would work as follows:\n\n* Initially, `num1` = 48 and `num2` = 18.\n* Divide `num1` by `num2` to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 12.\n* Update `num1` to 18 and `num2` to 12.\n* Repeat the process:\n\t+ Divide `num1` by `num2` to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 6.\n\t+ Update `num1` to 12 and `num2` to 6.\n\t+ Divide `num1` by `num2` to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.\n* At this point, the remainder is 0, so the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6.\n\nAnswer: The Euclidean algorithm implemented in Python as follows:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(num1, num2):\n    while num2!= 0:\n        remainder = num1 % num2\n        num1 = num2\n        num2 = remainder\n    return num1\n\nprint(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6\n```",
            "Algorithm:\n1. Start by defining a function to calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.\n2. The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers, based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.\n3. The function should take two arguments, a and b, which are the two numbers for which the GCD is to be calculated.\n4. If b is zero, return a, as the GCD of a and b is a.\n5. Otherwise, call the function recursively with b and the remainder of a divided by b, which is a % b.\n6. Continue this process until b is zero, at which point a is the GCD of the original a and b.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Euclidean algorithm is a simple and efficient method for calculating the GCD of two numbers. The basic idea is to repeatedly replace the larger number with its difference with the smaller number, until the two numbers are equal, at which point the GCD has been found.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Start with two numbers, a and b.\n2. If b is zero, return a, as the GCD of a and b is a. This is because the GCD of a number and zero is the number itself.\n3. Otherwise, calculate the remainder of a divided by b, which is a % b.\n4. Call the function recursively with b and the remainder calculated in step 3.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until b is zero.\n6. At this point, a is the GCD of the original a and b.\n\nFor example, if we want to find the GCD of 48 and 18, we would follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with a = 48 and b = 18.\n2. Since b is not zero, calculate the remainder of a divided by b: 48 % 18 = 12.\n3. Call the function recursively with b = 18 and the remainder = 12.\n4. Since b is not zero, calculate the remainder of a divided by b: 18 % 12 = 6.\n5. Call the function recursively with b = 12 and the remainder = 6.\n6. Since b is not zero, calculate the remainder of a divided by b: 12 % 6 = 0.\n7. Since b is zero, return a = 6, which is the GCD of 48 and 18.\n\nAnswer: The function gcd(a, b) = a if b = 0 else gcd(b, a % b)"
