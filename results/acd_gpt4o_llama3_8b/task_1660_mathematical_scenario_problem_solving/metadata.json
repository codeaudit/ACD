We can rearrange this equation to express \\(h\\) in terms of \\(r\\): \\(h = \\frac{10,000}{\\pi r^2}\\).\n\nNext, substitute this expression for \\(h\\) into the surface area function \\(A = 2\\pi r (r + h)\\): \\(A = 2\\pi r (r + \\frac{10,000}{\\pi r^2})\\).\n\nNow, simplify the surface area function: \\(A = 2\\pi r^2 + \\frac{20,000}{r}\\).\n\nTo minimize the surface area, we can take the derivative of the surface area function with respect to \\(r\\) and set it equal to zero: \\(\\frac{dA}{dr} = 4\\pi r - \\frac{20,000}{r^2} = 0\\).\n\nNow, solve for \\(r\\): \\(4\\pi r^3 - 20,000 = 0 \\implies r^3 = \\frac{20,000}{4\\pi} \\implies r = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{20,000}{4\\pi}}\\).\n\nCalculate the value of \\(r\\): \\(r \\approx \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{20,000}{4\\pi}} \\approx 11.48\\).\n\nNow that we have the value of \\(r\\), we can find the corresponding value of \\(h\\) using the expression \\(h = \\frac{10,000}{\\pi r^2}\\): \\(h = \\frac{10,000}{\\pi (11.48)^2} \\approx 6.99\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $r = 11.48, h = 6.99$",

            "content": "Given the task family \"mathematical_scenario_problem_solving,\" let's analyze the capabilities tested and the LLM agent's success on this task:\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Mathematical Reasoning and Problem-Solving**:\n   - LLMs, particularly those trained on vast datasets including mathematical texts, have demonstrated some proficiency in solving mathematical problems. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world scenario-based problems is still evolving and often falls short compared to domain experts.\n\n2. **Complexity of the Task**:\n   - The provided example requires optimization (minimizing surface area given a volume constraint) which involves calculus. This is a non-trivial problem that requires understanding and applying mathematical concepts like derivatives and possibly solving equations.\n   - The second scenario requires calculating an average speed by considering different segments with varying speeds, which involves weighted averaging.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to score the solution based on correctness and completeness of explanations is appropriate, assuming the judge model is well-calibrated and capable of understanding and evaluating detailed mathematical solutions.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - This task is marked as difficult for humans, indicating a higher level of complexity that would generally challenge even those with a solid understanding of mathematics.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the complexity of the mathematical problems and the high level of reasoning required to solve them correctly and explain the steps clearly, it is surprising and noteworthy that the LLM agent succeeded in this task.\n\nDecision: Yes"
