Since the car starts at a speed of 20 m/s and comes to a stop, the change in velocity is \u0394v = 0 - 20 m/s = -20 m/s. The time over which the acceleration occurs is \u0394t = 5 seconds. Therefore, the acceleration is a = -20 m/s / 5 s = -4 m/s^2.\n\nCalculation: The distance traveled by the car can be calculated using the equation d = v_i*t + (1/2)*a*t^2, where d is the distance, v_i is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration. We already know that the initial velocity is 20 m/s, the time is 5 seconds, and the acceleration is -4 m/s^2. Plugging in these values, we get d = 20 m/s * 5 s + (1/2)*(-4 m/s^2)*(5 s)^2 = 100 m - 50 m = 50 m.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Find the change in velocity: \u0394v = 0 - 20 m/s = -20 m/s\n2. Find the acceleration: a = \u0394v / \u0394t = -20 m/s / 5 s = -4 m/s^2\n3. Find the distance traveled: \n   a. Use the equation d = v_i*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n   b. Plug in the values: d = 20 m/s * 5 s + (1/2)*(-4 m/s^2)*(5 s)^2\n   c. Simplify the equation: d = 100 m - 50 m = 50 m",
            "To solve this problem, we'll use the following formulas:\n\n1. Acceleration (a) = \u0394v / \u0394t (change in velocity over change in time)\n2. Distance (d) = v0t + (1/2)at^2 (where v0 is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration)\n\nGiven values:\n- Initial velocity (v0) = 20 m/s\n- Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s (since it comes to a stop)\n- Time (t) = 5 seconds\n\nFirst, let's calculate the acceleration (a):\na = \u0394v / \u0394t = (v - v0) / t = (0 - 20) / 5 = -4 m/s^2\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance (d) traveled by the car:\nd = v0t + (1/2)at^2\n= 20 * 5 + (1/2) * (-4) * (5)^2\n= 100 - 50\n= 50 m\n\nNow, let's put it all together as required:\n\nCalculation: The car's acceleration is -4 m/s^2, and the distance it traveled during this time is 50 meters.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Acceleration (a) = \u0394v / \u0394t = (v - v0) / t = (0 - 20) / 5 = -4 m/s^2\n2. Distance (d) = v0t + (1/2)at^2 = 20 * 5 + (1/2) * (-4) * (5)^2 = 100 - 50 = 50 m",
            "To solve this problem, I will use the basic principles of physics, specifically the equations of motion.\n\nFirst, I will calculate the acceleration of the car. Since the car comes to a stop in 5 seconds, I can use the equation:\n\na = \u0394v / \u0394t\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, \u0394v is the change in velocity (final velocity - initial velocity), and \u0394t is the time over which the acceleration occurs.\n\nGiven that the car's initial velocity is 20 m/s and its final velocity is 0 m/s (since it comes to a stop), I can plug in the values:\n\na = (0 - 20) / 5\na = -4 m/s^2\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction to the initial velocity, which makes sense since the car is slowing down.\n\nNext, I will calculate the distance traveled by the car during this time. I can use the equation:\n\ns = v0t + (1/2)at^2\n\nwhere s is the distance traveled, v0 is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ns = 20(5) + (1/2)(-4)(5)^2\ns = 100 - 50\ns = 50 m\n\nSo, the car's acceleration is -4 m/s^2, and the distance it traveled during this time is 50 m.\n\nCalculation: The car's acceleration is -4 m/s^2, and the distance it traveled during this time is 50 m.\n\nCalculations:\nInitial velocity (v0) = 20 m/s\nFinal velocity (v) = 0 m/s\nTime (t) = 5 seconds\nAcceleration (a) = \u0394v / \u0394t = (0 - 20) / 5 = -4 m/s^2\nDistance (s) = v0t + (1/2)at^2 = 20(5) + (1/2)(-4)(5)^2 = 100 - 50 = 50 m",
            "Calculation: To calculate the car's acceleration and the distance it traveled, we can use the following formulas:\n\n1. Acceleration (a) = \u0394v / \u0394t, where \u0394v is the change in velocity and \u0394t is the time over which the acceleration occurs.\n2. Distance (d) = v0t + (1/2)at^2, where v0 is the initial velocity, t is the time, and a is the acceleration.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Calculate the change in velocity (\u0394v):\n\u0394v = v0 - v1, where v0 is the initial velocity (20 m/s) and v1 is the final velocity (0 m/s).\n\u0394v = 20 m/s - 0 m/s = 20 m/s\n\n2. Calculate the acceleration (a):\na = \u0394v / \u0394t = 20 m/s / 5 s = 4 m/s^2\n\n3. Calculate the distance traveled (d):\nFirst, we need to find the average velocity (v_avg) over the time period:\nv_avg = (v0 + v1) / 2 = (20 m/s + 0 m/s) / 2 = 10 m/s\n\nThen, we can use the formula for distance:\nd = v0t + (1/2)at^2\nd = (20 m/s)(5 s) + (1/2)(4 m/s^2)(5 s)^2\nd = 100 m + 50 m\nd = 150 m\n\nTherefore, the car's acceleration is 4 m/s^2, and the distance it traveled during this time is 150 m.",
            "To solve this problem, I will use the following physical principles:\n\n1. The equation for uniformly accelerated motion: v = u + at, where v is the final velocity (0 m/s), u is the initial velocity (20 m/s), a is the acceleration, and t is the time (5 s).\n2. The equation for distance traveled: s = ut + 0.5at^2, where s is the distance traveled, u is the initial velocity (20 m/s), t is the time (5 s), and a is the acceleration.\n\nFirst, I will solve for the acceleration using the first equation:\n\nv = u + at\n0 = 20 + a(5)\na = -20/5\na = -4 m/s^2\n\nNext, I will solve for the distance traveled using the second equation:\n\ns = ut + 0.5at^2\ns = (20)(5) + 0.5(-4)(5)^2\ns = 100 - 50\ns = 50 m\n\nNow, I will present my calculations in the required format:\n\nCalculation: The car's acceleration is -4 m/s^2, and the distance it traveled during this time is 50 m.\n\nCalculations:\n1. a = -20/5\na = -4 m/s^2\n2. s = (20)(5) + 0.5(-4)(5)^2\ns = 100 - 50\ns = 50 m"
