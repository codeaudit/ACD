In the worst case, each cell in the array takes constant time to compute, resulting in a total of `O(n*W)` time complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n*W), where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the knapsack.\n\n- Space Complexity:\n  The algorithm uses a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (W+1)` to store the dynamic programming table. Each cell in the array requires constant space, resulting in a total space complexity of O(n*W).\n\nIn summary, the given algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*W) and a space complexity of O(n*W), where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the knapsack. The algorithm is efficient for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem.",

Complexity Analysis:\nThe time complexity of the algorithm is O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the knapsack capacity. This is because we are using a 2D table of size (n+1) x (W+1) and we are iterating over each cell once.\n\nThe space complexity of the algorithm is also O(nW), as we need to store the 2D table of size (n+1) x (W+1) in memory.\n\nNote: The algorithm has a pseudo-polynomial time complexity, which means that the running time increases polynomially with the size of the input (in this case, the knapsack capacity W). However, for small values of W, the algorithm is efficient and can solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time.",

The recurrence relation is based on whether the current item can fit in the current capacity or not. If it can fit, we choose the maximum between including the current item or excluding it. If it cannot fit, we exclude it. The algorithm has a time and space complexity of O(nW), making it efficient for solving the 0/1 knapsack problem.",

Complexity Analysis:\n\nThe time complexity of the above algorithm is O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the knapsack. This is because we are using a 2D table of size (n+1) x (W+1) and we are iterating over each cell in the table once.\n\nThe space complexity of the algorithm is also O(nW), as we need to store the 2D table in memory. However, we can optimize the space complexity to O(W) by only storing the previous row of the table, as we only need to access the previous row to fill in the current row.\n\nTo achieve this, we can modify the algorithm as follows:\n\n```\nFUNCTION knapsack(W, wt, val, n)\n  CREATE A 1D TABLE prev OF SIZE (W+1)\n\n  FOR w FROM 0 TO W\n    prev[w] = 0\n  END FOR\n\n  FOR i FROM 1 TO n\n    CREATE A 1D TABLE curr OF SIZE (W+1)\n\n    FOR w FROM 0 TO W\n      IF wt[i-1] <= w\n        curr[w] = MAX(val[i-1] + prev[w-wt[i-1]], prev[w])\n      ELSE\n        curr[w] = prev[w]\n    END FOR\n\n    prev = curr\n  END FOR\n\n  RETURN prev[W]\n\nEND FUNCTION\n```\n\nThis modified algorithm has a time complexity of O(nW) and a space complexity of O(W)."
