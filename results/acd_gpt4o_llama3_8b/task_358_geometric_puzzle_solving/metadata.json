The area of the square is calculated by squaring the side length of the square:\nArea of square = side length\u00b2 = 8\u00b2 = 64 square units\n2. The area of the circle is calculated using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 8 units. Therefore, the radius of the circle is half of the diameter, which is 4 units.\nArea of circle = \u03c0r\u00b2 = \u03c0(4)\u00b2 = 16\u03c0 square units\n3. To find the area outside the circle but inside the square, we subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square:\nArea outside circle but inside square = Area of square - Area of circle = 64 - 16\u03c0\n\nHowever, we need to provide a numerical answer, so we'll use an approximation of \u03c0.

            "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the area of the square and the area of the circle, and then subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square.\n\nCalculations:\n1. The area of the square is found by squaring its side length: \n   Area of square = side^2 = 8^2 = 64\n\n2. The area of the circle is found by using the formula A = \u03c0 * r^2 where r is the radius of the circle. Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, which means the radius is half of the side length of the square. So, the radius of the circle is 4 units. \n   Area of circle = \u03c0 * 4^2 = 16\u03c0 \u2248 50.265\n\n3. Now, to find the area of the region outside the circle but inside the square, we need to subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square:\n   Area of the region outside the circle but inside the square = Area of square - Area of circle \u2248 64 - 50.265 \u2248 13.735\n\nAnswer: 13.735",

            "Calculations: \nTo find the area of the region outside the circle but inside the square, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the area of the circle. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the square:\nThe area of the square = side length * side length\n= 8 units * 8 units\n= 64 square units\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the circle:\nThe radius of the circle is half the side length of the square, which is 8/2 = 4 units.\nThe area of the circle = \u03c0r^2\n= \u03c0(4)^2\n\u2248 3.14159 * 16\n\u2248 50.26548 square units\n\nNow, let's find the area of the region outside the circle but inside the square:\nArea = Area of the square - Area of the circle\n\u2248 64 - 50.26548\n\u2248 13.73452 square units\n\nHowever, since this problem can be solved using a more straightforward method. We can see that the radius of the circle is half the side length of the square, so we can directly calculate the area of the region outside the circle but inside the square.\n\nAnother way to solve this problem is by realizing that the area of the region outside the circle but inside the square is equal to the area of a square with side length 8 minus the area of four quarter circles with radius 4 (half the side length of the square). This area can be calculated as follows:\nThe area of the four quarter circles = 4 * (1/4 * \u03c0r^2) \n= \u03c0r^2\n= \u03c0(4)^2\n\u2248 3.14159 * 16\n\u2248 50.26548 square units\n\nHowever, there's another method to solve it by realizing that the area outside the circle but inside the square can also be calculated by finding the area of the square and then subtracting the four quarter circles.

To get this area, we can use the formula 64 - 4* (1/4 * \u03c0r^2) which is equal to 64 - 16 * \u03c0 or (64 - 16 * \u03c0), where r is the radius of the circle which is half the side length of the square.\n\nWe can simplify this formula to get the area outside the circle but inside the square directly as follows:\n(64 - 16 * \u03c0) \n\u2248 13.73452 square units\n\nHowever, there's another method to solve it by realizing that the area outside the circle but inside the square can be found by using the formula (side length)^2 - \u03c0r^2. \nWe can simplify this formula to get the area outside the circle but inside the square directly as follows:\n(8)^2 - \u03c0(4)^2 \n= 64 - 16 * \u03c0 \n\u2248 13.73452 square units\n\nAnswer: 13.73452",
