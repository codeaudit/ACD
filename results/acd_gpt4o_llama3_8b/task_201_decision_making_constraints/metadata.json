            "To solve this problem, I'll follow the given instructions step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the scenario and constraints:\nThe goal is to plan a party within a budget of $100, with the need to buy at least one item in each category (snacks, drinks, decorations). The costs per item are $2 for snacks, $3 for drinks, and $5 for decorations.\n\n2. Calculate the optimal decision that fits within the budget and meets the requirements:\nFirst, I'll prioritize buying snacks, as they are the cheapest option. I can fit 50 snacks within the budget ($100 / $2 = 50 snacks).\n\n3. Next, I'll allocate the remaining budget for drinks and decorations. After buying 50 snacks ($100 - $100 = $0, but I can buy 33 drinks ($100 / $3 = 33.33, rounded down to 33 drinks), and 0 decorations within the remaining budget).\n\nHowever, this does not leave room for any decorations. Instead, I can buy 20 decorations ($100 - $60 = $40, $40 / $5 = 8, rounded down to 8 decorations), which leaves $60 for drinks. With $60, I can buy 20 drinks ($60 / $3 = 20).\n\nTherefore, I can only buy 20 drinks and 8 decorations, which still meets the requirement of having at least one item in each category.\n\n4. Ensure the decision is practical and maximizes the specified criteria:\nThe decision maximizes the variety of items (snacks, drinks, decorations) within the given budget.\n\nFinal Answer: \nSnacks: 50, Drinks: 20, Decorations: 8",
            "To solve this problem, I will first analyze the constraints and the goal of maximizing the variety of items.\n\nThe total budget is $100, and each item category must have at least one item. The costs are as follows: Snacks: $2 each, Drinks: $3 each, and Decorations: $5 each.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize the variety of items, I will prioritize buying the least expensive items first, which are the Snacks and Drinks. I will also try to buy as many items as possible in each category while staying within the budget.\n\nHere's a possible plan:\n\n1. Buy 1 Snack for $2 (minimum requirement)\n2. Buy 1 Drink for $3 (minimum requirement)\n3. Buy 1 Decoration for $5 (minimum requirement)\n4. With the remaining budget of $100 - $2 - $3 - $5 = $90, I will allocate $90 / $2 = 45 Snacks. However, since we need to stay within the budget, I will buy 45 Snacks is not feasible, so I will buy the maximum number of Snacks possible, which is 45 / 2 = 22.5. Since we can only buy whole items, I will buy 22 Snacks.\n5. With the remaining budget of $90 - $44 (22 Snacks * $2) = $46, I will allocate $46 / $3 = 15.33 Drinks. Since we can only buy whole items, I will buy 15 Drinks.\n6. With the remaining budget of $46 - $45 (15 Drinks * $3) = $1, I will allocate $1 / $5 = 0.2 Decorations. Since we can only buy whole items, I will not buy any more Decorations.\n\nThe final plan is:\n\nSnacks: 22, Drinks: 15, Decorations: 1\n\nThis plan maximizes the variety of items while staying within the budget of $100."

            "To solve this problem, I will follow the given instructions and constraints. \n\nFirst, let's break down the given information:\n\n- Venue rental costs $200.\n- Refreshments cost $10 per person.\n- Each speaker charges $100.\n- 20 attendees are expected.\n- At least 2 speakers are needed.\n\nGiven the budget is $500, the first step is to allocate a fixed amount for the venue rental as it is a mandatory expense. \n\nRemaining Budget = $500 - $200 (venue) = $300\n\nNext, we need to determine the maximum number of speakers we can afford. Since each speaker costs $100, we will start by allocating for at least 2 speakers. \n\nCost for 2 speakers = $100 * 2 = $200\nRemaining Budget for refreshments and additional speakers = $300 - $200 = $100\n\nSince we want to maximize the number of speakers, we will allocate the remaining $100 to speaker fees. This will allow us to add 1 more speaker for a total of 3 speakers.\n\nCost for 3 speakers = $100 * 3 = $300\nRemaining Budget = $300 (used up, no remaining budget for refreshments)\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost for refreshments:\n\nCost for refreshments = $10 * 20 attendees = $200\nHowever, we don't have the remaining budget for refreshments, so we will just allocate the remaining budget to refreshments.\n\nActual cost for refreshments = $100 (remaining budget)\n\nTo meet the attendee refreshment requirement, we need to reduce the refreshment budget. \n\n$100 (actual cost for refreshments) < $200 (calculated cost for refreshments)\n\nTo meet the budget requirement, we can calculate the actual number of attendees we can afford refreshments for:\n\n$100 / $10 = 10 attendees\n\nSince we can only afford refreshments for 10 attendees, we will reduce the attendee count to 10.\n\nNow we have the final budget allocation:\n\nVenue: $200, Refreshments: $100, Speakers: $300"
