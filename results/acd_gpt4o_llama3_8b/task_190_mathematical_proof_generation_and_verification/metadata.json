            "To prove the theorem that the sum of the first n natural numbers is (n*(n+1))/2, we will use mathematical induction.\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\n\nWe need to prove that the statement is true for n = 1. The sum of the first 1 natural number is 1, which is equal to (1*(1+1))/2 = 1. Therefore, the statement is true for n = 1.\n\n**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**\n\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, i.e., the sum of the first k natural numbers is (k*(k+1))/2. We can write this as:\n\nS(k) = (k*(k+1))/2\n\n**Step 3: Inductive Step**\n\nWe need to prove that if the statement is true for k, then it is also true for k + 1. In other words, we need to prove that the sum of the first (k+1) natural numbers is ((k+1)*(k+2))/2.\n\nLet's consider the sum of the first (k+1) natural numbers:\n\nS(k+1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1)\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nS(k+1) = S(k) + (k+1)\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, we can substitute S(k) = (k*(k+1))/2:\n\nS(k+1) = (k*(k+1))/2 + (k+1)\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the first term by (k+2)/(k+2), which is equal to 1:\n\nS(k+1) = ((k*(k+1))/(k+2)) * ((k+2)/2) + (k+1)\n\nS(k+1) = (k*(k+1)) + (k+1)*((k+2)/2)\n\nS(k+1) = (k*(k+1)) + (k+1)*(k+1)\n\nS(k+1) = (k*(k+1)) + (k+1)^2\n\nS(k+1) = (k*(k+1)) + (k^2 + 2k + 1)\n\nS(k+1) = k^2 + k + k^2 + 2k + 1\n\nS(k+1) = 2k^2 + 3k + 1\n\nTo simplify this expression further, we can use the fact that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2:\n\nS(k+1) = (k^2 + k + 1)^2\n\nS(k+1) = (k+1)^2 * (k+1)\n\nS(k+1) = (k+1)^2 * (k+1+1)\n\nS(k+1) = (k+1)^2 * ((k+1)+1)\n\nS(k+1) = (k+1)^2 * (k+2)\n\nS(k+1) =

The sum of the first 1 natural number is 1, and (1*(1+1))/2 = 1. Therefore, P(1) is true.\n\nInductive Step:\nAssume that P(k) is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that the sum of the first k natural numbers is (k*(k+1))/2.\n\nWe need to show that P(k+1) is true. We know that the sum of the first (k+1) natural numbers is equal to the sum of the first k natural numbers plus (k+1).\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nSum of first (k+1) natural numbers = Sum of first k natural numbers + (k+1)\n= (k*(k+1))/2 + (k+1)\n\nTo show that P(k+1) is true, we need to show that the sum of the first (k+1) natural numbers is equal to ((k+1)*((k+1)+1))/2.\n\nWe can simplify the expression (k*(k+1))/2 + (k+1) as follows:\n\n(k*(k+1))/2 + (k+1) = (k^2 + k)/2 + (k+1)\n= (k^2 + k + 2k + 2)/2\n= (k^2 + 3k + 2)/2\n\nWe can factor the numerator as follows:\n\n(k^2 + 3k + 2) = (k+1)(k+2)\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n(k^2 + 3k + 2)/2 = ((k+1)(k+2))/2\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression ((k+1)(k+2))/2 as follows:\n\n((k+1)(k+2))/2 = ((k+1)((k+1)+1))/2\n\nTherefore, we have shown that P(k+1) is true.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that P(n) is true for all positive integers n.\n\nAnswer: By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that the sum of the first n natural numbers is (n*(n+1))/2.",

            "Proof for Theorem: Sum of First n Natural Numbers\n\nTo prove the theorem using mathematical induction, we need to establish two main components: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nBase Case:\nLet n = 1. The sum of the first n natural numbers is 1, which is equal to (1*(1+1))/2 = 1. Therefore, the statement is true for n = 1.\n\nInductive Step:\nAssume the statement is true for n = k, i.e., the sum of the first k natural numbers is (k*(k+1))/2. We need to show that if the statement is true for n = k, then it is also true for n = k+1.\n\nThe sum of the first (k+1) natural numbers can be expressed as the sum of the first k natural numbers plus (k+1). By the inductive hypothesis, the sum of the first k natural numbers is (k*(k+1))/2.\n\nSum of first (k+1) natural numbers = Sum of first k natural numbers + (k+1)\n= (k*(k+1))/2 + (k+1)\n\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the first term by (k+2)/(k+2) to get a common denominator:\n\nSum of first (k+1) natural numbers = ((k*(k+1))/2)*(k+2)/(k+2) + (k+1)\n= (k*(k+1)*(k+2))/2(k+2) + (k+1)\n= (k*(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2\n= (k^2 + k + 2k + 2)/2\n= (k^2 + 3k + 2)/2\n= ((k+1)*(k+2))/2\n\nTherefore, the statement is true for n = k+1, completing the inductive step.\n\nBy mathematical induction, we have shown that the statement is true for all natural numbers n. The sum of the first n natural numbers is indeed (n*(n+1))/2."
