            "Problem: \n\nTo create a public park that maximizes green space while providing recreational areas and facilities for community events, I propose designing a park that incorporates various elements to meet the constraints. The park will be called \"Green Oasis.\"\n\n**Layout:**\nThe 5-acre park will be divided into four main areas: Green Space, Recreation, Community, and Facilities.\n\n1. **Green Space (3 acres)**: This area will consist of a large open lawn, a meandering walking path, and a series of native plant gardens. The lawn will be suitable for picnics, relaxation, and passive recreation. The walking path will be 6 feet wide and made of permeable pavers to allow for rainwater infiltration. The native plant gardens will provide a habitat for local wildlife and reduce maintenance needs.\n2. **Recreation (1 acre)**: This area will feature a playground for children, a sports field for games and activities, and a multipurpose court for events and programs. The playground will be designed with inclusive features, such as transfer stations and wheelchair-accessible swings. The sports field will be a synthetic turf surface with a rubber crumb infill to provide a safe and durable playing surface. The multipurpose court will be a hard surface made of a durable material, such as concrete or asphalt.\n3. **Community (0.5 acres)**: This area will be dedicated to community events and activities. It will feature a large event space with a stage, a community garden, and a picnic area. The event space will be designed to accommodate a variety of events, such as concerts, festivals, and community gatherings. The community garden will provide a space for residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables.
