The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. \n\nThe function works by using recursion. It has a base case where if `n` is 0, it returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 is 1). If `n` is not 0, it calls itself with the argument `n-1` and multiplies the result by `n`. This process continues until `n` reaches 0, at which point the function starts returning the results back up the call stack, multiplying them together. \n\nFor example, when `factorial(5)` is called, it first calculates `factorial(4)`, which in turn calculates `factorial(3)`, then `factorial(2)`, `factorial(1)`, and finally `factorial(0)`. At this point, it returns 1 and the other functions start returning their results. So, the final result of `factorial(5)` is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. \n\nThe print statement at the end of the code calls the function with the argument 5 and prints the result, which is 120.",

Advanced LLMs are generally good at making such modifications when the requirements are clearly specified.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty:**\n   - While the task is rated as difficult for a human, this difficulty often arises from understanding more complex code or requirements. The provided example is relatively simple, reducing the overall challenge for an LLM.\n\n3. **LLM Capabilities:**\n   - LLMs, especially those trained extensively on code, have shown proficiency in both understanding and generating code snippets.\n   - The success in this task aligns with the expected capabilities of an LLM to parse and modify code as per given instructions.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method:**\n   - The `eval_with_llm_judge` function validates the output against clear criteria, ensuring the correctness of the LLM's response.\n   - The criteria are straightforward: accepting an additional argument and using it, which are easy to check programmatically.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe LLM's success in this task is not surprising given the nature of the task and the known capabilities of LLMs in handling code comprehension and modification tasks.\n\n**Decision: No**"
