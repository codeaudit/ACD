            "Penalty/Distribution: $10,000\nReasoning: \n\nIn this scenario, Company A was required to deliver the product on the 15th of each month but instead delivered it on the 20th. To determine the penalty, we need to calculate the number of days Company A was late.\n\nThe contract specifies a penalty of $500 per day of delay. To find the number of days of delay, we subtract the date of delivery (20th) from the date of the deadline (15th) to get a delay of 5 days. \n\nSince the delay is 5 days, and the penalty is $500 per day, the total penalty amount is 5 * $500 = $2,500 per month. \n\nHowever, since Company A breached their obligations for one month, the total penalty would be $2,500. However, the document does not specify a penalty for the remaining 11 months of the contract. \n\nTherefore, the total penalty amount is the product of the penalty per month and the number of months remaining in the contract, which is $2,500 * 12 = $30,000.\n\nHowever, the question is for the penalty for one month. Hence, the correct answer is $2,500 * 1 = $2,500 does not match the requirement of the question. Therefore, the correct answer is $2,500 * (5-4) * 1 = $2,500.\n\nHowever, the more accurate interpretation would be \n$2,500 (5 days) + $1,250 (4 days) = $3,750 + $6,250 = $10,000.\n\nHence, the correct answer is $10,000.",
            "Penalty/Distribution: $10,000 \nReasoning: The contract states that Company A must deliver 100 units of product X by the 15th of each month. Since the delivery was made on the 20th of the month, it is 5 days late. According to the contract, Company A will pay a penalty of $500 per day of delay. Therefore, the total penalty amount is $500 x 5 days = $2,500. However, the document also states that the contract is valid for one year and can be renewed upon mutual agreement, which implies that the penalty amount is a flat rate per day and not a percentage of the total contract value. Therefore, the penalty amount is $2,500.",
            "Penalty/Distribution: $11,000 \nReasoning: The contract states that Company A must deliver the product by the 15th of each month. Since Company A delivered the product on the 20th, it is 5 days late. The penalty for each day of delay is $500. Therefore, the total penalty is 5 days * $500 per day = $2,500 per month. Since the contract is valid for one year, there are 12 months. The total penalty is $2,500 per month * 12 months = $30,000. However, the document does not specify the penalty for late delivery over the one-year period. It only specifies the penalty for each month.

However, since this is a recurring contract that is valid for one year, the penalty will be calculated for each month. There are 12 months in a year, and if we assume that Company A delivers late for all 12 months, the total penalty would be 12 months x $2,500 per month = $30,000. However, the question asks for the penalty for a single month, so we use the 5-day delay penalty, $2,500, and multiply it by the 1.5 factor, since the contract is valid for one year, but the penalty is calculated for the single month.

Therefore, the total penalty is calculated as $500 per day of delay multiplied by the number of days of delay, which is 5. This results in a total penalty of $2,500. However, the contract does not specify any limitations on the maximum number of days for which the penalty can be calculated. Therefore, considering the contract's intent to penalize Company A for any delay, the penalty should be calculated for the entire period from the 15th to the 20th, which is 5 days. Additionally, the contract does not specify any minimum penalty amount, so the penalty amount is calculated as $500 per day of delay, without any additional minimum amount.

            "Penalty/Distribution: $10,000\nReasoning: \n\nIn this scenario, Company A was required to deliver the product on the 15th of each month but instead delivered it on the 20th. To determine the penalty, we need to calculate the number of days Company A was late.\n\nThe contract specifies a penalty of $500 per day of delay. To find the number of days of delay, we subtract the date of delivery (20th) from the date of the deadline (15th) to get a delay of 5 days. \n\nSince the delay is 5 days, and the penalty is $500 per day, the total penalty amount is 5 * $500 = $2,500 per month. \n\nHowever, since Company A breached their obligations for one month, the total penalty would be $2,500. However, the document does not specify a penalty for the remaining 11 months of the contract. \n\nTherefore, the total penalty amount is the product of the penalty per month and the number of months remaining in the contract, which is $2,500 * 12 = $30,000.\n\nHowever, the question is for the penalty for one month. Hence, the correct answer is $2,500 * 1 = $2,500 does not match the requirement of the question. Therefore, the correct answer is $2,500 * (5-4) * 1 = $2,500.\n\nHowever, the more accurate interpretation would be \n$2,500 (5 days) + $1,250 (4 days) = $3,750 + $6,250 = $10,000.\n\nHence, the correct answer is $10,000.",

This method can be problematic since it relies on the LLM's understanding to score another LLM, which might not be reliable for highly specialized tasks.\n\n4. **Example Task Performance**:\n    - The document provides clear scenarios where the LLM has to calculate penalties or distribute an estate based on given legal documents.
