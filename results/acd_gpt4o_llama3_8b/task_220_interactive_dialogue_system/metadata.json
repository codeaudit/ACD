            "Functionality Description:\nThe chatbot, named \"SupportBot,\" is designed to handle common customer queries related to order status, product information, and return policies. SupportBot uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand the customer's intent and respond accordingly. If SupportBot cannot resolve the query or requires additional information, it will escalate the issue to a human representative.\n\nDialogue Flow:\n1. Customer initiates conversation: The customer sends a message to SupportBot, which prompts the customer to enter a query or ask a question.\n2. SupportBot understands the query: SupportBot uses NLP to analyze the customer's message and determine the intent behind it.\n3. SupportBot responds: Based on the customer's query, SupportBot provides a relevant response, which may include product information, order status updates, or return policies.\n4. Customer clarifies or asks follow-up questions: If the customer needs additional information or clarification, they can ask SupportBot follow-up questions.\n5. SupportBot escalates or resolves the issue: If SupportBot cannot resolve the query or requires additional information, it will escalate the issue to a human representative. Otherwise, SupportBot will continue to provide support until the issue is resolved.\n\nExample Dialogues:\n\n**Order Status Query**\nCustomer: \"Hi, I placed an order on Monday. Can you tell me the status?\"\nSupportBot: \"Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help.

You'll receive an email with tracking information once it ships.\"\nCustomer: \"Thank you for the update!\"\n\n**Product Information Query**\nCustomer: \"Can you tell me more about the product 'Smart Watch X'?\"\nSupportBot: \"The Smart Watch X is a popular product with many features, including fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, and notification alerts. It's available in several colors and sizes. Would you like to know more about a specific feature or would you like to place an order?\"\nCustomer: \"I'd like to know more about the battery life.\"\nSupportBot: \"The Smart Watch X has a battery life of up to 5 days on a single charge, depending on usage. You can also charge it wirelessly with a Qi-compatible charger.\"\n\n**Return Policy Query**\nCustomer: \"I'd like to return my order.
