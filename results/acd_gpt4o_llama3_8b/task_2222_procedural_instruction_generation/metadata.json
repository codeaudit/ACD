            "Here are the step-by-step instructions for changing a flat tire:\n\n**Before You Start:**\n\n* Make sure you are in a safe location, away from traffic, and turn off the engine.\n* Engage the parking brake and put the car in park (automatic) or first gear (manual).\n* Turn on the hazard lights to alert other drivers.\n* Gather the necessary tools: lug wrench (also known as a tire iron), spare tire, and car jack.\n\n**Step 1: Loosen the Lug Nuts (Before Jacking)**\n\n* Find the flat tire and locate the lug nuts. They should be on the outside of the wheel, around the center hub.\n* Position the lug wrench on the first lug nut and turn it counterclockwise to loosen it. Do not remove it yet.\n* Loosen the remaining lug nuts in the same way, but do not remove them yet.\n\n**Step 2: Raise the Car with the Jack**\n\n* Position the jack under the car's frame, near the flat tire. Refer to your car's manual for the correct location.\n* Raise the jack until the flat tire is off the ground, but not so high that the car is unstable.\n* Use jack stands for added safety, if available.\n\n**Step 3: Remove the Lug Nuts and Flat Tire**\n\n* Now that the car is raised, you can remove the lug nuts from the wheel hub. Turn them counterclockwise and set them aside in a safe place.\n* Carefully pull the flat tire straight off the wheel hub and set it aside.\n\n**Step 4: Install the Spare Tire**\n\n* Place the spare tire onto the wheel hub and hand tighten the lug nuts. Make sure the tire is properly seated and centered.\n* Tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern (tightening one lug nut a little, then moving to the next one, and so on) to ensure even tightening.\n\n**Step 5: Lower the Car and Tighten the Lug Nuts**\n\n* Carefully lower the car to the ground using the jack.\n* Once the car is back on the ground, use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts as tight as possible in a star pattern.\n\n**Step 6: Check the Tire Pressure**\n\n* Make sure the spare tire is inflated to the recommended pressure, which can be found on the tire's sidewall or in your car's manual.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n* Double-check that the lug nuts are tightened securely and the spare tire is properly seated.\n* Drive carefully to a tire repair shop to have the flat tire repaired or replaced.",
            "Here are the step-by-step instructions for changing a flat tire on a car:\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the Area and Gather Necessary Tools**\n\n Move your vehicle to a flat and stable surface, away from traffic. Turn off the engine and engage the parking brake. Gather the following tools and equipment:\n\n* Spare tire\n* Lug wrench (also known as a tire iron)\n* Car jack\n* Wheel chocks (optional)\n* Flashlight (if changing the tire in the dark)\n* Gloves and safety glasses (recommended)\n\n**Step 2: Loosen the Lug Nuts (Before Jacking)**\n\nBefore you jack up the vehicle, loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire using the lug wrench. Turn the lug nuts counterclockwise until they are loose, but do not remove them yet.\n\n**Step 3: Jack Up the Vehicle**\n\nPosition the jack under the vehicle's frame, near the flat tire. Refer to your vehicle's owner's manual for the correct jacking points on your specific vehicle. Raise the jack until the flat tire is off the ground, but not so high that the vehicle is unstable. Use jack stands for added safety if available.\n\n**Step 4: Remove the Lug Nuts and Flat Tire**\n\nNow that the vehicle is raised, you can remove the lug nuts completely by turning them counterclockwise. Place them in a safe location where they won't get lost. Carefully pull the flat tire straight off the wheel hub and set it aside.\n\n**Step 5: Install the Spare Tire**\n\nPlace the spare tire onto the wheel hub, making sure it is securely seated. Hand tighten the lug nuts to hold the tire in place.\n\n**Step 6: Tighten the Lug Nuts**\n\nLower the vehicle to the ground using the jack. Use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern (tightening one lug nut a little, then moving to the next one, and so on). Make sure they are tightened snugly, but do not overtighten.\n\n**Step 7: Check the Tire Pressure**\n\nMake sure the spare tire is inflated to the recommended pressure, which can be found on the tire's sidewall or in your vehicle's owner's manual.\n\n**Step 8: Dispose of the Flat Tire**\n\nDispose of the flat tire responsibly, either by taking it to a tire repair shop or a recycling center.\n\n**Step 9: Double-Check Everything**\n\nDouble-check that the lug nuts are tightened securely and the vehicle is stable before driving. Drive carefully to a tire repair shop to have the flat tire repaired or replaced.",

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to change a flat tire on a car, including the use of a jack and lug wrench:\n\n**Before You Start:**\n\n1. Make sure you're in a safe location: Move your car to a flat, stable surface, away from traffic. Turn off the engine and engage the parking brake.\n2. Gather the necessary tools: You'll need a lug wrench (also known as a tire iron), a jack, and a spare tire.\n3. Check your owner's manual: Familiarize yourself with the location of the spare tire, jack, and lug wrench in your car.\n\n**Step 1: Loosen the Lug Nuts (Before Jacking)**\n\n1. Find the lug nuts: Locate the lug nuts on the flat tire. They should be on the outside of the wheel, around the center hub.\n2. Position the lug wrench: Place the lug wrench on the first lug nut and make sure it's securely seated.\n3. Loosen the lug nut: Turn the lug wrench counterclockwise to loosen the lug nut. Don't remove it yet.\n4. Repeat for the other lug nuts: Loosen all the lug nuts in a star pattern (tightening one lug nut a little, then moving to the next one, and so on).\n\n**Step 2: Jack the Car**\n\n1. Position the jack: Place the jack under the car's frame, near the flat tire. Refer to your owner's manual for the correct location.\n2. Raise the jack: Slowly raise the jack until it makes contact with the frame. Continue to raise the jack until the flat tire is off the ground, but not so high that the car is unstable.\n3. Use jack stands (optional): If you have jack stands, place them near the jack to provide extra support and safety.\n\n**Step 3: Remove the Lug Nuts and Flat Tire**\n\n1. Completely remove the lug nuts: Now that the car is raised, you can completely remove the lug nuts from the wheel hub.\n2. Remove the flat tire: Carefully pull the flat tire straight off the wheel hub and set it aside.\n\n**Step 4: Install the Spare Tire**\n\n1. Place the spare tire: Put the spare tire onto the wheel hub, making sure it's securely seated.\n2. Hand-tighten the lug nuts: Place the lug nuts back onto the wheel hub and hand-tighten them in a star pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Tighten the Lug Nuts**\n\n1. Lower the car: Carefully lower the car to the ground using the jack.\n2. Tighten the lug nuts: Use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern, making sure they're snug and secure.\n\n**Step 6: Check the Tire Pressure**\n\n1. Check the owner's manual: Find the recommended tire pressure for the spare tire in your owner's manual.\n2. Check the tire pressure: Use a tire pressure gauge to ensure the spare tire is inflated to the recommended pressure.\n\n**Step 7: Drive Carefully**\n\n1. Drive carefully: Drive carefully to a tire repair shop to have the flat tire repaired or replaced.\n2. Avoid high speeds: Avoid driving at high speeds or for long distances on the spare tire.\n\nRemember to always refer to your owner's manual for specific instructions on how to change a flat tire for your particular vehicle. If you're not comfortable changing a flat tire, call for roadside assistance or seek help from a professional mechanic.",

Use jack stands (optional): If you have jack stands, place them near the jack to provide extra support and safety.\n\n**Step 3: Remove the Lug Nuts and Flat Tire**\n\n1. Completely remove the lug nuts: Now that the car is raised, you can completely remove the lug nuts from the wheel hub.\n2. Remove the flat tire: Carefully pull the flat tire straight off the wheel hub and set it aside.\n\n**Step 4: Install the Spare Tire**\n\n1. Place the spare tire: Put the spare tire onto the wheel hub, making sure it's securely seated.\n2. Hand-tighten the lug nuts: Place the lug nuts back onto the wheel hub and hand-tighten them in a star pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Tighten the Lug Nuts**\n\n1. Lower the car: Carefully lower the car to the ground using the jack.\n2. Tighten the lug nuts: Use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern, making sure they're snug and secure.\n\n**Step 6: Check the Tire Pressure**\n\n1. Check the owner's manual: Find the recommended tire pressure for the spare tire in your owner's manual.\n2. Check the tire pressure: Use a tire pressure gauge to ensure the spare tire is inflated to the recommended pressure.\n\n**Step 7: Drive Carefully**\n\n1. Drive carefully: Drive carefully to a tire repair shop to have the flat tire repaired or replaced.\n2. Avoid high speeds: Avoid driving at high speeds or for long distances on the spare tire.\n\nRemember to always refer to your owner's manual for specific instructions on how to change a flat tire for your particular vehicle. If you're not comfortable changing a flat tire, call for roadside assistance or seek help from a professional mechanic.",
            "**Changing a Flat Tire on a Car: A Step-by-Step Guide**\n\n**Warning:** Before starting, make sure you are in a safe location, away from traffic, and turn off the engine. Engage the parking brake and put the car in park (automatic) or in gear (manual).\n\n**Tools Needed:**\n\n- Spare tire\n- Lug wrench (also known as a tire iron)\n- Jack\n- Wheel chocks (optional)\n- Flashlight (if changing the tire in the dark)\n\n**Step 1: Gather Information and Prepare the Area**\n\n- Check the owner's manual to find the location of the spare tire, lug wrench, and jack.\n- Find a flat, stable surface to change the tire, away from traffic.\n- If changing the tire on a slope, use wheel chocks to prevent the car from rolling.\n\n**Step 2: Loosen the Lug Nuts (Before Jacking)**\n\n- Before you jack up the car, loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire using the lug wrench. Turn them counterclockwise until they are loose, but do not remove them yet.\n\n**Step 3: Jack Up the Car**\n\n- Position the jack under the car's frame, near the flat tire. Consult the owner's manual for the correct location.\n- Raise the jack until the flat tire is off the ground, but not so high that the car is unstable.\n- Use jack stands for added safety, if available.\n\n**Step 4: Remove the Lug Nuts and Flat Tire**\n\n- Now that the car is raised, you can remove the lug nuts from the wheel using the lug wrench. Turn them counterclockwise until they are completely removed.\n- Carefully pull the flat tire straight off the wheel hub and set it aside.\n\n**Step 5: Install the Spare Tire**\n\n- Place the spare tire onto the wheel hub, making sure it is centered and secure.\n- Hand-tighten the lug nuts to hold the tire in place.\n\n**Step 6: Tighten the Lug Nuts**\n\n- Use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern (tightening one lug nut, then moving to the next one in a star shape). Make sure they are snug, but do not overtighten.\n\n**Step 7: Lower the Car**\n\n- Carefully lower the car to the ground using the jack.\n- Remove the jack stands, if used.\n\n**Step 8: Tighten the Lug Nuts Again**\n\n- Now that the car is back on the ground, use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts as tight as possible in a star pattern.\n\n**Step 9: Check the Tire Pressure**\n\n- Make sure the spare tire is inflated to the recommended pressure, which can be found on the tire's sidewall or in the owner's manual.\n\n**Step 10: Drive Carefully and Get the Flat Tire Repaired**\n\n- Drive carefully to a tire repair shop to have the flat tire repaired or replaced.\n- Do not drive at high speeds or for an extended period with the spare tire."

However, the challenge lies in the clarity and accuracy of the instructions, particularly for tasks that involve safety or technical steps.\n\n**Considerations on the Evaluation Method**:\n- **eval_with_llm_judge**: This method suggests that another LLM is used to judge the quality of the instructions based on predefined criteria. This could be problematic because LLMs might not always accurately judge the practical applicability of instructions, especially for tasks that require physical actions and safety considerations.\n\n**Decision**:\n- The agent succeeded at generating clear and accurate instructions for changing a flat tire. Considering the capabilities of current LLMs, this task is well within their strengths.
