Replace colloquial phrases with more formal alternatives.\n2. Use active voice to convey a sense of agency and enthusiasm.\n3. Emphasize the positive outcome with stronger adjectives.\n\nNow, here's my transformed text:\n\nAnswer: We are delighted to inform you that your application has been formally accepted.

            "Let's break down the task. To transform the original text to match the specified writing style and tone, we need to make it informal and urgent.\n\nInformal writing style typically involves using contractions, colloquial expressions, and a more casual tone. To make the text more urgent, we can use words and phrases that convey a sense of importance and time sensitivity.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Replace formal language with contractions and colloquial expressions.\n2. Use words and phrases that convey a sense of urgency.\n\nWith that in mind, here's the transformed text:\n\n\"Hey team, the deadline just got moved up to next week. We need to bump this up to priority status ASAP and let everyone know about the change. Let's get moving!\"\n\nNow, let's submit the transformed text as a plain text string:\n\nHey team, the deadline just got moved up to next week. We need to bump this up to priority status ASAP and let everyone know about the change. Let's get moving!",

            "Here's my plan to transform the text:\n\n1. Use contractions to make the language more informal: \"has been\" becomes \"has\" and \"Make sure\" becomes \"Make\".\n2. Use a more urgent tone by using words and phrases that convey a sense of urgency, such as \"drop everything\" and \"ASAP\".\n3. Use a more casual tone by using colloquial expressions and slang.\n\nHere's the transformed text:\n\nMake drop everything and prioritize this project ASAP! It's deadline has moved up to next week, so you need to get on it NOW and let your team know about the changes ASAP.\n\nAnswer: Make drop everything and prioritize this project ASAP!

They typically excel at understanding context, adjusting tone, and applying various stylistic nuances, especially when clear instructions are provided.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Contextual Language Transformation**: LLMs have shown proficiency in rephrasing and transforming text while maintaining coherence and context.\n2. **Stylistic Adaptation**: They are capable of adopting different writing styles, such as formal, informal, technical, or casual.\n3. **Tone Recognition**: LLMs can usually detect and reproduce different tones, like enthusiastic, urgent, or neutral, effectively.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n- The task includes clear transformation instructions.\n- The evaluation criteria used by `eval_with_llm_judge` are reasonable and straightforward.\n- The provided example text and style/tone instructions are typical scenarios where LLMs tend to perform well.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not particularly surprising. The task leverages the LLM's strengths in style and tone adjustment, which are well within its expected capabilities.\n\n### Decision:\nDecision: No"
