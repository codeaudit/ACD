In this problem, we are given the base as 12 cm and the height as 9 cm. We simply need to plug these values into the formula, and then perform the multiplication to find the area.\n\n1. We start by plugging in the given values: base = 12 cm and height = 9 cm.\n2. Next, we apply the formula: Area = 1/2 * 12 * 9. We first multiply the base and height, which gives us 12 * 9 = 108. Then, we apply the 1/2 factor, which means we divide 108 by 2.\n3. Performing the division, we find that 108 / 2 = 54.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 54 square centimeters.",

The base of the triangle is given as 12 cm, and the height is given as 9 cm. We can substitute these values into the formula to find the area.\n\nFirst, we multiply the base and height together: 12 \u00d7 9 = 108. This is the numerator of our fraction.\n\nNext, we divide the product of the base and height by 2, which is the denominator of our fraction. This gives us 108 / 2 = 54.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 54 square centimeters.",

I plugged in the given values for b and h, which were 12 cm and 9 cm, respectively. I then multiplied the base and height together to get 108 square cm, and finally multiplied the result by 0.5 to get the area, which was 54 square cm.",

Here, \u03c0 is approximately 3.14, and r is 7 cm. So, we substitute these values into the formula to get Area = 3.14 * (7)\u00b2 = 3.14 * 49.\n\nNext, we calculate the value of 3.14 * 49, which equals 154.06 cm\u00b2.
