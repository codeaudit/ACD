Given that these criteria are within the capabilities of advanced LLMs, the evaluation method should be effective.\n\nGiven these factors, the success of an LLM on this task is not particularly surprising. Advanced LLMs are expected to handle tasks involving structured creative writing, such as generating song lyrics, quite well.\n\n**Decision**: No"
