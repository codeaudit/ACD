Here are the key considerations:\n\n1. **Programming Skills and Logical Reasoning:** Modern LLMs like GPT-3.5 have shown proficiency in understanding and generating code, as well as correcting errors in provided code snippets. They are trained on vast amounts of code and have developed significant programming skills.\n\n2. **Technical Knowledge:** The tasks provided (finding the maximum in a list and calculating the average of numbers) are fundamental programming tasks that are well within the capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty:** While the task is rated \"difficult\" for humans, it is relatively straightforward for an LLM that has been trained on similar coding tasks.\n\n4. **LLM Judge Suitability:** The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to automatically score the completed or corrected code is appropriate, as LLMs can effectively evaluate whether the code meets the criteria and produces the expected output.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is not surprising that an LLM agent succeeded at this task. Completing and debugging basic code snippets are well within the expected capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\n**Decision: No**"
