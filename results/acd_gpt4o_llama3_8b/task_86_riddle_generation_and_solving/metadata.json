Time is often seen as a thief because it \"steals\" moments away, and it's closely related to the concept of \"passing with the day.\" The mention of time being \"sly in the morning\" and \"near\" at noon suggests its gradual approach.

            "To solve this riddle, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. \"I speak without a mouth\": This suggests that the answer is not a living being that uses a mouth to speak. It could be something that makes sounds or communicates without a physical mouth.\n2. \"and hear without ears\": This part of the riddle indicates that the answer is not capable of hearing in the classical sense, as it does not have ears. It might be something that responds to sounds or vibrations.\n3. \"I have no body\": This line reinforces the idea that the answer is not a living being or an object with a physical presence.\n4. \"but I come alive with the wind\": This part of the riddle suggests that the answer is something that is typically dormant or inactive but becomes active or comes to life when there is wind.\n\nConsidering these clues, a likely solution to the riddle is an echo. An echo:\n\n- Speaks without a mouth, as it is a sound that is reflected back.\n- Hears without ears, as it responds to the sound waves that cause it.\n- Has no body, as it is not a physical entity.\n- Comes alive with the wind, as the wind can carry and amplify sounds, making the echo more noticeable.\n\nAnswer: An echo.",
