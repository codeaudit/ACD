LLMs can often provide general advice based on their training data but may struggle with nuanced and highly specific medical cases.\n\n2. **Context Understanding and Synthesis**: The LLM needs to not only understand the symptoms but also synthesize them into coherent and medically accurate advice. This involves integrating multiple pieces of information and prioritizing safety and clarity.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty Level**: The task is deemed \"very difficult\" for humans, suggesting that even experts might find it challenging. This sets a high bar for the LLM's performance.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the LLM's response. While LLM judges can provide a consistent and objective evaluation, their ability to accurately assess the medical accuracy and safety of advice can be limited compared to human medical professionals.\n\n5. **Task Instructions**: The instructions are clear and provide specific criteria for evaluation, which should help guide the LLM in generating a suitable response.\n\nConsidering these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would be noteworthy due to the high level of difficulty and the need for precise and accurate medical advice. Conversely, if the LLM failed, it would be expected given the complexity of the task.\n\nDecision: Yes"
