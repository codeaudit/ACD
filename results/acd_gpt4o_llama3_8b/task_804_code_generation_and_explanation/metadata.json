This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n\nThe list comprehension iterates over each number `num` in the input list `nums`. For each number, it calls the `is_prime(n)` function to check whether the number is prime. If it is, the number is included in the resulting list.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses a helper function to check primality, which avoids duplicating code in the list comprehension. The list comprehension itself is also efficient, as it only requires a single pass over the input list.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n * sqrt(n)) due to the `is_prime(n)` function, where n is the number of elements in the input list. However, for large inputs, this solution should still be efficient enough due to the use of the list comprehension, which has a time complexity of O(n).",
            "- Code: \n```\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_primes(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums if is_prime(num)]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\nprime_numbers = get_primes(numbers)\nprint(prime_numbers)\n```\n\n- Explanation:\nThe code consists of two functions: `is_prime(n)` and `get_primes(nums)`. The `is_prime(n)` function checks whether a given integer `n` is prime or not. The `get_primes(nums)` function uses the `is_prime(n)` function to filter out non-prime numbers from a given list of integers.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1.  The `is_prime(n)` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it's prime and `False` otherwise.\n2.  The function starts by checking if `n` is less than 2, in which case it's not prime, so the function returns `False`.\n3.  The function then iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop. This is because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n4.  Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`).

It then checks if `n` is divisible by 2, in which case it's not a prime number.\n3.  To optimize performance, it calculates the maximum possible divisor (`max_divisor`) as the square root of `n` (rounded up) plus 1.

It then iterates over odd numbers from 3 to `max_divisor` (with a step of 2) and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers.

It calls the `is_prime(n)` function for each number in `nums` and includes it in the output list if it's prime.\n\nFinally, the example usage demonstrates how to use the `get_primes(nums)` function to filter a list of numbers and print the resulting list of prime numbers.",

It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1, `True` for the number 2 (the only even prime), and `False` for even numbers greater than 2. For odd numbers, it checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, incrementing by 2 each time (since we're only interested in odd factors). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it's prime, and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe second function, `get_primes(nums)`, takes a list of integers `nums` and uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers from `nums` that are prime, as determined by the `is_prime(n)` function. The list comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create a new list from an existing list, and it's particularly well-suited to this task because it allows us to filter out non-prime numbers in a single pass over the input list.\n\nThis function can handle lists of up to 100,000 integers efficiently because it uses the `is_prime(n)` function, which has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for each number checked, and the list comprehension also has a time complexity of O(n), making the overall time complexity of `get_primes(nums)` O(n*sqrt(n)) in the worst case. However, in practice, the time complexity will be much better because we're only checking each number once, and the `is_prime(n)` function will often return early if it finds a divisor.",

We iterate over each number `n` in `numbers` and check if it's prime using the `is_prime` function. If `n` is prime, it's included in the new list.\n\n3.  **Efficient implementation**: The `is_prime` function uses a optimization to only check divisibility up to the square root of `n`, which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(\u221an) for each number. This makes the function efficient for large lists of integers.\n\n4.  **Input handling**: The `get_primes` function can handle lists of up to 100,000 integers efficiently due to the optimized `is_prime` function and the use of list comprehension, which creates a new list in O(n) time complexity."

The sliding window is represented by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which move through the string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:\n\n1.  We first initialize the `left` pointer to 0, which represents the start of the sliding window. We also initialize `max_length` to 0 and `max_substring` to an empty string, which will store the longest substring without repeating characters found so far.\n2.  We create a dictionary `char_index` to store the index of each character in the string. This dictionary will help us to efficiently check if a character is already in the current window.\n3.  We iterate through the string using the `right` pointer. For each character, we check if it is already in the dictionary and its index is greater than or equal to the `left` pointer. If this condition is true, it means that the character is still in the current window, and we need to move the `left` pointer to the right of the previous occurrence of the character. We update the `left` pointer to the index of the previous occurrence of the character plus 1.\n4.  We update the index of the current character in the dictionary to its current position.\n5.  We check if the current window (i.e., the substring between the `left` and `right` pointers) is larger than the maximum length found so far. If it is, we update `max_length` and `max_substring` with the new maximum length and substring.\n6.  Finally, we return the longest substring without repeating characters found.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we are scanning the string only once using the sliding window approach. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we need to store all characters in the dictionary.",

The `start` variable stores the start index of the current substring without repeating characters. The `max_length` and `max_substring` variables are used to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding substring seen so far.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  Initialize the `char_index_map` dictionary and the `start` variable to zero. The `max_length` is initialized to zero, and the `max_substring` is initialized to an empty string.\n2.  Iterate over the input string `s` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the character `char` at that index.\n3.  Check if the current character `char` is already present in the `char_index_map` dictionary. If it is, and its last seen index is greater than or equal to the current `start`, update the `start` to the index after the last seen index of `char`. This is because all characters in the substring between the last seen index of `char` and the current `start` are repeating characters, so we need to move the start of the substring to the right of these characters.\n4.  Update the last seen index of `char` in the `char_index_map` dictionary to its current index `i`.\n5.  Check if the length of the current substring (i.e., `i - start + 1`) is greater than the maximum length `max_length` seen so far. If it is, update `max_length` and `max_substring` with the length and the current substring, respectively.\n6.  Return the `max_substring` after iterating over the entire string.\n\nThis function runs in O(n) time complexity because it makes a single pass over the input string.

Initialize `char_index`, `max_length`, and `max_start` variables. `max_length` is used to keep track of the maximum length of substring without repeating characters, while `max_start` is the starting index of the maximum substring.\n2.  Iterate over the string `s` using a for loop.\n3.  For each character `s[i]`, check if it's already in `char_index` and if its index is greater than or equal to `max_start`. If it is, update `max_start` to be the index after the previous occurrence of `s[i]`.\n4.  Update `char_index` with the current index `i` of `s[i]`.\n5.

After the loop, return the substring of `s` from `max_start` to `max_start + max_length`, which is the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nThis function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string `s`, because each character in `s` is visited at most twice: once in the forward pass and once in the backward pass to update `max_start` and `max_length`.

We first check if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, we return an empty string.\n2. We initialize three variables: `left`, `max_length`, and `max_substring`. `left` is the starting index of the current window, `max_length` is the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters seen so far, and `max_substring` is the corresponding substring.\n3. We create a dictionary `char_index` to store the last seen index of each character in the string. The keys of the dictionary are the characters, and the values are their indices.\n4. We iterate over the string from left to right using the `right` variable. For each character at the current position `right`, we check if it has been seen before (i.e., if it is in `char_index`). If it has, we move the `left` pointer to the right of the previous occurrence of the character. This is because the current window cannot contain any repeating characters.\n5. We update the `char_index` dictionary with the current character and its index.\n6. We check if the current window size (`right - left + 1`) is greater than the maximum length seen so far. If it is, we update `max_length` and `max_substring` accordingly.\n7. Finally, we return the longest substring without repeating characters found in the string.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set.

If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number.\n5.  If no divisors are found, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.\n\nThe `get_primes(nums)` function uses list comprehension to filter the input list `nums` and return a new list containing only the prime numbers from the original list. It calls the `is_prime(n)` function for each number in `nums` and includes it in the output list if it's prime.\n\nFinally, the example usage demonstrates how to use the `get_primes(nums)` function to filter a list of numbers and print the resulting list of prime numbers.",
            "- Code: \n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\ndef get_primes(nums):\n    return [num for num in nums if is_prime(num)]\n```\n\n- Explanation:\nThe function `is_prime(n)` checks whether a single number `n` is prime or not. It returns `False` for numbers less than or equal to 1, `True` for the number 2 (the only even prime), and `False` for even numbers greater than 2. For odd numbers, it checks divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number, incrementing by 2 each time (since we're only interested in odd factors). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime, and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it's prime, and the function returns `True`.\n\nThe second function, `get_primes(nums)`, takes a list of integers `nums` and uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers from `nums` that are prime, as determined by the `is_prime(n)` function. The list comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create a new list from an existing list, and it's particularly well-suited to this task because it allows us to filter out non-prime numbers in a single pass over the input list.\n\nThis function can handle lists of up to 100,000 integers efficiently because it uses the `is_prime(n)` function, which has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) for each number checked, and the list comprehension also has a time complexity of O(n), making the overall time complexity of `get_primes(nums)` O(n*sqrt(n)) in the worst case. However, in practice, the time complexity will be much better because we're only checking each number once, and the `is_prime(n)` function will often return early if it finds a divisor.",
            "Code:\n```python\ndef get_primes(numbers):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    return [n for n in numbers if is_prime(n)]\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `get_primes` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1.  **Helper function `is_prime`**: We define a helper function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise. This function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it's not prime. If `n` is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of `n` (inclusive), it's not prime. Otherwise, it's prime.\n\n2.  **List comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the prime numbers from the input list `numbers`. We iterate over each number `n` in `numbers` and check if it's prime using the `is_prime` function. If `n` is prime, it's included in the new list.\n\n3.  **Efficient implementation**: The `is_prime` function uses a optimization to only check divisibility up to the square root of `n`, which reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(\u221an) for each number. This makes the function efficient for large lists of integers.\n\n4.  **Input handling**: The `get_primes` function can handle lists of up to 100,000 integers efficiently due to the optimized `is_prime` function and the use of list comprehension, which creates a new list in O(n) time complexity."

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:\n\n1.  We initialize the `left` pointer to 0, `max_length` to 0, `max_substring` to an empty string, and an empty dictionary `char_dict`.\n2.  We then iterate over the string `s` with the `right` pointer.\n3.  Inside the loop, we check if the current character at the `right` index is already in the `char_dict`.

Finally, we return the `max_substring` as the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, and a space complexity of O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, as we need to store the last seen position of each character in the `char_dict`.",

The sliding window is represented by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which move through the string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:\n\n1.  We first initialize the `left` pointer to 0, which represents the start of the sliding window. We also initialize `max_length` to 0 and `max_substring` to an empty string, which will store the longest substring without repeating characters found so far.\n2.  We create a dictionary `char_index` to store the index of each character in the string. This dictionary will help us to efficiently check if a character is already in the current window.\n3.  We iterate through the string using the `right` pointer. For each character, we check if it is already in the dictionary and its index is greater than or equal to the `left` pointer. If this condition is true, it means that the character is still in the current window, and we need to move the `left` pointer to the right of the previous occurrence of the character. We update the `left` pointer to the index of the previous occurrence of the character plus 1.\n4.  We update the index of the current character in the dictionary to its current position.\n5.  We check if the current window (i.e., the substring between the `left` and `right` pointers) is larger than the maximum length found so far. If it is, we update `max_length` and `max_substring` with the new maximum length and substring.\n6.  Finally, we return the longest substring without repeating characters found.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we are scanning the string only once using the sliding window approach. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we need to store all characters in the dictionary.",

The `start` variable stores the start index of the current substring without repeating characters. The `max_length` and `max_substring` variables are used to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding substring seen so far.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  Initialize the `char_index_map` dictionary and the `start` variable to zero. The `max_length` is initialized to zero, and the `max_substring` is initialized to an empty string.\n2.  Iterate over the input string `s` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the character `char` at that index.\n3.  Check if the current character `char` is already present in the `char_index_map` dictionary. If it is, and its last seen index is greater than or equal to the current `start`, update the `start` to the index after the last seen index of `char`. This is because all characters in the substring between the last seen index of `char` and the current `start` are repeating characters, so we need to move the start of the substring to the right of these characters.\n4.  Update the last seen index of `char` in the `char_index_map` dictionary to its current index `i`.\n5.  Check if the length of the current substring (i.e., `i - start + 1`) is greater than the maximum length `max_length` seen so far. If it is, update `max_length` and `max_substring` with the length and the current substring, respectively.\n6.  Return the `max_substring` after iterating over the entire string.\n\nThis function runs in O(n) time complexity because it makes a single pass over the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, it needs to store the last seen index of each character in the `char_index_map` dictionary.",

Initialize `char_index`, `max_length`, and `max_start` variables. `max_length` is used to keep track of the maximum length of substring without repeating characters, while `max_start` is the starting index of the maximum substring.\n2.  Iterate over the string `s` using a for loop.\n3.  For each character `s[i]`, check if it's already in `char_index` and if its index is greater than or equal to `max_start`. If it is, update `max_start` to be the index after the previous occurrence of `s[i]`.\n4.  Update `char_index` with the current index `i` of `s[i]`.\n5.  Check if the current window size `i - max_start + 1` is greater than `max_length`. If it is, update `max_length` to the current window size.\n6.  After the loop, return the substring of `s` from `max_start` to `max_start + max_length`, which is the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nThis function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string `s`, because each character in `s` is visited at most twice: once in the forward pass and once in the backward pass to update `max_start` and `max_length`. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store all characters in `char_index`.",

The key idea is to keep track of the last seen index of each character in the string, and expand the window to the right as long as there are no repeating characters.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:\n\n1. We first check if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, we return an empty string.\n2. We initialize three variables: `left`, `max_length`, and `max_substring`. `left` is the starting index of the current window, `max_length` is the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters seen so far, and `max_substring` is the corresponding substring.\n3. We create a dictionary `char_index` to store the last seen index of each character in the string. The keys of the dictionary are the characters, and the values are their indices.\n4. We iterate over the string from left to right using the `right` variable. For each character at the current position `right`, we check if it has been seen before (i.e., if it is in `char_index`). If it has, we move the `left` pointer to the right of the previous occurrence of the character. This is because the current window cannot contain any repeating characters.\n5. We update the `char_index` dictionary with the current character and its index.\n6. We check if the current window size (`right - left + 1`) is greater than the maximum length seen so far. If it is, we update `max_length` and `max_substring` accordingly.\n7. Finally, we return the longest substring without repeating characters found in the string.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set. This is because we are using a dictionary to store the last seen index of each character, which takes at most O(min(n, m)) space."
