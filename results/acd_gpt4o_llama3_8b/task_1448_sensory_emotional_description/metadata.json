They can handle complex scenes and provide rich sensory details.\n2. **Emotional Evocation**: LLMs have been trained on vast amounts of text that include emotional language and can often simulate emotions effectively in their outputs.\n3. **Evaluation by another LLM**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function introduces some subjectivity and potential bias since the evaluation itself is conducted by another LLM. However, if the criteria are clear and the evaluating LLM is robust, it can be a reasonable proxy for human judgment.\n\nConsidering the estimated human difficulty is \"difficult,\" it suggests that the task might be challenging even for humans due to the need for nuanced and vivid emotional and sensory descriptions. However, LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in similar tasks, especially when guidelines are explicitly provided.\n\nGiven these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would not be particularly surprising to a human evaluator familiar with LLM capabilities.
