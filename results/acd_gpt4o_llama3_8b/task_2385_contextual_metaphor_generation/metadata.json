            "Metaphor: Navigating a Stormy Ocean with a Compass of Resilience\n\nExplanation: This metaphor compares overcoming life's challenges to navigating a stormy ocean. Just as a sailor relies on a compass to stay on course and find safe harbor, a person overcoming challenges must rely on their inner compass of resilience to guide them through turbulent times. The compass represents the ability to stay focused, adaptable, and determined, even in the face of adversity. By using this metaphor, we can see that overcoming challenges is not about avoiding the storms of life, but about having the inner strength and guidance to navigate through them and find calmer waters.",
            "Metaphor: A mountain climber navigating through a storm.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor represents the challenges in life as a turbulent storm that the mountain climber must navigate through to reach the summit. Just as the climber must use their skills, experience, and equipment to navigate through the storm and reach the top, individuals facing challenges in life must use their own strengths, resilience, and resources to overcome obstacles and reach their goals. The storm symbolizes the uncertainty and turmoil that often accompanies challenges, while the mountain climber's journey represents the perseverance and determination required to succeed.",
            "Metaphor: Life is a garden of thorns and flowers.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that life is a mix of challenges (thorns) and opportunities (flowers). Just as a garden requires effort to cultivate and maintain, overcoming challenges in life requires perseverance and dedication. The thorns represent the obstacles and difficulties that must be navigated, while the flowers symbolize the growth, beauty, and rewards that come from facing and overcoming them.",
            "Metaphor: Life is a River with Rapids and Calm Waters\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that life is a journey with varying levels of difficulty, where challenges (rapids) and periods of calm (smooth waters) are intertwined. Just as a river navigates through rapids, we must navigate through the turbulent challenges of life, using our skills, resilience, and determination to overcome obstacles and reach the calm waters of stability and growth. The calm waters represent the sense of accomplishment and peace that comes from persevering through difficulties, making the journey worthwhile.",
            "Metaphor: Weaving a tapestry through turbulent waters.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that overcoming challenges in life is like navigating through turbulent waters and simultaneously weaving a tapestry. The turbulent waters represent the obstacles and difficulties one faces, while the act of weaving a tapestry signifies the process of shaping and creating something beautiful out of the chaos. The tapestry can be thought of as one's resilience, strength, and growth, which are developed and refined as they navigate through life's challenges."

            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone is a stone that is constantly moving or rolling, and it gathers no moss because it is always in motion and does not have the opportunity to settle in one place long enough for moss to grow on it.\n\nExplanation: The metaphor \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\" suggests that people who are constantly on the move, never staying in one place for long, will not be able to accumulate wealth, knowledge, or other benefits that come from stability and consistency. It implies that those who are always restless and never settle down will miss out on the opportunities that come from being rooted in one place. This metaphor can also be seen as a commentary on the fleeting nature of life and the importance of finding stability and security.\n\nIn a deeper sense, the metaphor can be interpreted as a warning against the dangers of restlessness and discontent. It suggests that those who are always chasing after new experiences and never satisfied with what they have will never be able to truly accumulate anything of value. It is a reminder that stability and consistency are essential for growth and success.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A person who constantly changes jobs and never stays in one place for long may gather no moss, or accumulate no wealth or benefits, because they are always starting over and never building on their previous experiences.\n* A traveler who is always on the move and never stays in one place for more than a few days may gather no moss, or miss out on the opportunity to truly experience and understand the places they visit.\n* A person who is always chasing after new relationships and never commits to one person may gather no moss, or miss out on the opportunity to build a deep and lasting connection with someone.\n* A business that is constantly changing its strategy and never stays focused on one goal may gather no moss, or miss out on the opportunity to truly achieve success and build a strong reputation.",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone is a stone that is constantly moving and does not remain in one place, and as a result, it does not gather any moss that might grow on a stationary stone.\n\nExplanation: The metaphor \"a rolling stone gathers no moss\" carries a deeper meaning that goes beyond its literal interpretation. It suggests that stability, consistency, and a sense of belonging are necessary for growth, prosperity, and success. A person or entity that is constantly moving or changing, but not necessarily in a positive direction, will not be able to accumulate the benefits and advantages that come with stability. This could include things like relationships, wealth, knowledge, or reputation. The phrase is often used to caution against a restless or nomadic lifestyle, and to encourage individuals to find a path that allows them to settle and put down roots.\n\nExamples: \n\n- In personal relationships, someone who is always moving from one romantic partner to another, without ever committing to one person, may find it difficult to form lasting connections or build a strong sense of trust with others.\n- A business that constantly changes its strategy or direction may find it hard to establish a loyal customer base or build a strong reputation in the market.\n- A student who never commits to a particular academic path or field of study may find it challenging to make progress or achieve their goals, as they are constantly switching between different subjects or courses.\n- A person who is always looking for the next big thing or the next adventure, but never takes the time to cultivate their skills or build their knowledge, may find themselves struggling to achieve long-term success or fulfillment.\n\nOverall, the metaphor \"a rolling stone gathers no moss\" serves as a reminder that stability, consistency, and a sense of belonging are essential for growth, prosperity, and success in various aspects of life.",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone gathers no moss.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that a person or thing that is constantly in motion, never settling in one place, will not accumulate wealth, possessions, or benefits (represented by the \"moss\" that grows on a stationary stone). The metaphor implies that stability and consistency are necessary for success, security, and growth, whereas continuous change and movement hinder one's ability to accumulate value.\n\nExamples: \n\nIn business, a company that is constantly changing its strategy and direction may gather no market share or loyal customers (as in \"The company's constant changes in leadership have made it hard for them to gather a loyal customer base.\").\nIn relationships, a person who is always moving from one partner to another may never form deep connections or build a stable family (as in \"Their constant string of short-term relationships has made it difficult for them to gather a strong support system.\").\nIn personal finance, an individual who is always spending and never saving may never accumulate wealth (as in \"Their constant impulse purchases have made it hard for them to gather enough savings for a down payment on a house.\").",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone is a physical object that is in constant motion and does not come to rest in one place long enough to accumulate moss, which is a type of lichen that grows on stationary surfaces.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that a person who is constantly moving, restless, or lacking stability will not be able to accumulate wealth, possessions, or accomplishments. It implies that stability and consistency are necessary for growth and success. The metaphor is often used to caution against a life of constant change and instability, as it can lead to a lack of progress and achievement. In a broader sense, the metaphor can also be applied to relationships, where a partner who is always on the move may not be able to form deep connections or build a lasting partnership.\n\nExamples:\n- A young professional who constantly changes jobs every few months will not be able to gather a stable income or build a reputation in their field.\n- A person who is always traveling and never stays in one place for too long may not be able to accumulate a stable home or family life.\n- A company that is constantly changing its business model or strategy may not be able to gather a loyal customer base or build a strong brand reputation.\n- A person who is always jumping from one hobby to another may not be able to gather a deep understanding or mastery of any one skill or activity.",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone gathers no moss.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that individuals who are constantly changing their circumstances, moving from one thing to another, or never settling in one place, are unlikely to accumulate wealth, knowledge, or experiences. The phrase implies that stability and consistency are necessary for growth and accumulation. The rolling stone is a symbol of a restless and migratory lifestyle, while moss represents the accumulation of wealth, wisdom, or status.\n\nExamples:\n\n* In a business context, a company that frequently changes its business model or strategy may struggle to build a strong reputation or accumulate a loyal customer base, much like a rolling stone gathering no moss.\n* In a personal relationship, someone who constantly jumps from one romantic partner to another may never truly connect with anyone or build a long-term partnership, illustrating the idea that a rolling stone gathers no moss.\n* In a metaphorical sense, a person who is always chasing new trends or fads may never develop a deep understanding or mastery of anything, much like a rolling stone gathering no moss.\n\nThis metaphor can be applied in various contexts to convey the idea that consistency, stability, and perseverance are essential for achieving success, building relationships, or accumulating knowledge and wealth."

Just as the climber must use their skills, experience, and equipment to navigate through the storm and reach the top, individuals facing challenges in life must use their own strengths, resilience, and resources to overcome obstacles and reach their goals. The storm symbolizes the uncertainty and turmoil that often accompanies challenges, while the mountain climber's journey represents the perseverance and determination required to succeed.",
            "Metaphor: Life is a garden of thorns and flowers.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that life is a mix of challenges (thorns) and opportunities (flowers). Just as a garden requires effort to cultivate and maintain, overcoming challenges in life requires perseverance and dedication. The thorns represent the obstacles and difficulties that must be navigated, while the flowers symbolize the growth, beauty, and rewards that come from facing and overcoming them.",
            "Metaphor: Life is a River with Rapids and Calm Waters\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that life is a journey with varying levels of difficulty, where challenges (rapids) and periods of calm (smooth waters) are intertwined. Just as a river navigates through rapids, we must navigate through the turbulent challenges of life, using our skills, resilience, and determination to overcome obstacles and reach the calm waters of stability and growth. The calm waters represent the sense of accomplishment and peace that comes from persevering through difficulties, making the journey worthwhile.",
            "Metaphor: Weaving a tapestry through turbulent waters.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that overcoming challenges in life is like navigating through turbulent waters and simultaneously weaving a tapestry. The turbulent waters represent the obstacles and difficulties one faces, while the act of weaving a tapestry signifies the process of shaping and creating something beautiful out of the chaos. The tapestry can be thought of as one's resilience, strength, and growth, which are developed and refined as they navigate through life's challenges."

            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone is a stone that is constantly moving or rolling, and it gathers no moss because it is always in motion and does not have the opportunity to settle in one place long enough for moss to grow on it.\n\nExplanation: The metaphor \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\" suggests that people who are constantly on the move, never staying in one place for long, will not be able to accumulate wealth, knowledge, or other benefits that come from stability and consistency. It implies that those who are always restless and never settle down will miss out on the opportunities that come from being rooted in one place. This metaphor can also be seen as a commentary on the fleeting nature of life and the importance of finding stability and security.\n\nIn a deeper sense, the metaphor can be interpreted as a warning against the dangers of restlessness and discontent. It suggests that those who are always chasing after new experiences and never satisfied with what they have will never be able to truly accumulate anything of value. It is a reminder that stability and consistency are essential for growth and success.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A person who constantly changes jobs and never stays in one place for long may gather no moss, or accumulate no wealth or benefits, because they are always starting over and never building on their previous experiences.\n* A traveler who is always on the move and never stays in one place for more than a few days may gather no moss, or miss out on the opportunity to truly experience and understand the places they visit.\n* A person who is always chasing after new relationships and never commits to one person may gather no moss, or miss out on the opportunity to build a deep and lasting connection with someone.\n* A business that is constantly changing its strategy and never stays focused on one goal may gather no moss, or miss out on the opportunity to truly achieve success and build a strong reputation.",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone is a stone that is constantly moving and does not remain in one place, and as a result, it does not gather any moss that might grow on a stationary stone.\n\nExplanation: The metaphor \"a rolling stone gathers no moss\" carries a deeper meaning that goes beyond its literal interpretation. It suggests that stability, consistency, and a sense of belonging are necessary for growth, prosperity, and success. A person or entity that is constantly moving or changing, but not necessarily in a positive direction, will not be able to accumulate the benefits and advantages that come with stability. This could include things like relationships, wealth, knowledge, or reputation. The phrase is often used to caution against a restless or nomadic lifestyle, and to encourage individuals to find a path that allows them to settle and put down roots.\n\nExamples: \n\n- In personal relationships, someone who is always moving from one romantic partner to another, without ever committing to one person, may find it difficult to form lasting connections or build a strong sense of trust with others.\n- A business that constantly changes its strategy or direction may find it hard to establish a loyal customer base or build a strong reputation in the market.\n- A student who never commits to a particular academic path or field of study may find it challenging to make progress or achieve their goals, as they are constantly switching between different subjects or courses.\n- A person who is always looking for the next big thing or the next adventure, but never takes the time to cultivate their skills or build their knowledge, may find themselves struggling to achieve long-term success or fulfillment.\n\nOverall, the metaphor \"a rolling stone gathers no moss\" serves as a reminder that stability, consistency, and a sense of belonging are essential for growth, prosperity, and success in various aspects of life.",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone gathers no moss.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that a person or thing that is constantly in motion, never settling in one place, will not accumulate wealth, possessions, or benefits (represented by the \"moss\" that grows on a stationary stone). The metaphor implies that stability and consistency are necessary for success, security, and growth, whereas continuous change and movement hinder one's ability to accumulate value.\n\nExamples: \n\nIn business, a company that is constantly changing its strategy and direction may gather no market share or loyal customers (as in \"The company's constant changes in leadership have made it hard for them to gather a loyal customer base.\").\nIn relationships, a person who is always moving from one partner to another may never form deep connections or build a stable family (as in \"Their constant string of short-term relationships has made it difficult for them to gather a strong support system.\").\nIn personal finance, an individual who is always spending and never saving may never accumulate wealth (as in \"Their constant impulse purchases have made it hard for them to gather enough savings for a down payment on a house.\").",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone is a physical object that is in constant motion and does not come to rest in one place long enough to accumulate moss, which is a type of lichen that grows on stationary surfaces.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that a person who is constantly moving, restless, or lacking stability will not be able to accumulate wealth, possessions, or accomplishments. It implies that stability and consistency are necessary for growth and success. The metaphor is often used to caution against a life of constant change and instability, as it can lead to a lack of progress and achievement. In a broader sense, the metaphor can also be applied to relationships, where a partner who is always on the move may not be able to form deep connections or build a lasting partnership.\n\nExamples:\n- A young professional who constantly changes jobs every few months will not be able to gather a stable income or build a reputation in their field.\n- A person who is always traveling and never stays in one place for too long may not be able to accumulate a stable home or family life.\n- A company that is constantly changing its business model or strategy may not be able to gather a loyal customer base or build a strong brand reputation.\n- A person who is always jumping from one hobby to another may not be able to gather a deep understanding or mastery of any one skill or activity.",
            "Literal Translation: A rolling stone gathers no moss.\n\nExplanation: This metaphor suggests that individuals who are constantly changing their circumstances, moving from one thing to another, or never settling in one place, are unlikely to accumulate wealth, knowledge, or experiences. The phrase implies that stability and consistency are necessary for growth and accumulation. The rolling stone is a symbol of a restless and migratory lifestyle, while moss represents the accumulation of wealth, wisdom, or status.\n\nExamples:\n\n* In a business context, a company that frequently changes its business model or strategy may struggle to build a strong reputation or accumulate a loyal customer base, much like a rolling stone gathering no moss.\n* In a personal relationship, someone who constantly jumps from one romantic partner to another may never truly connect with anyone or build a long-term partnership, illustrating the idea that a rolling stone gathers no moss.\n* In a metaphorical sense, a person who is always chasing new trends or fads may never develop a deep understanding or mastery of anything, much like a rolling stone gathering no moss.\n\nThis metaphor can be applied in various contexts to convey the idea that consistency, stability, and perseverance are essential for achieving success, building relationships, or accumulating knowledge and wealth."

This task requires advanced capabilities in abstract thinking, language comprehension, and creative interpretation.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Abstract Thinking and Creativity:** Generating a novel metaphor requires the model to understand abstract concepts and creatively link them to the given context. This is a higher-level linguistic skill that goes beyond straightforward text generation.\n2. **Language Comprehension:** The model must understand the context deeply to create a meaningful metaphor that fits well.\n3. **Interpretation Skills:** For interpreting existing metaphors, the model needs to provide a detailed analysis, which includes literal translation, deeper meaning, and applicability in various contexts.\n\n### Human Difficulty:\n- This task is marked as difficult for humans, indicating a high level of complexity and requiring advanced language skills.\n\n### Evaluation Method:\n- The `score` method uses an LLM judge (`eval_with_llm_judge`) to assess the quality of the generated metaphor and its explanation based on specific criteria.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that the task requires a sophisticated level of abstract thinking and creativity, which are known to be challenging areas for current LLMs, the success of the agent in this task is noteworthy.
