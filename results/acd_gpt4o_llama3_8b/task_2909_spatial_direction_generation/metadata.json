This suggests that, while not trivial, an average human can perform this task with some effort.\n\n3. **LLM Capabilities**:\n   - Modern LLMs are generally proficient at understanding and generating natural language text.\n   - LLMs have shown some capability in handling spatial reasoning tasks, especially when the spatial relationships are clearly described.\n   - LLMs can generate coherent text based on structured prompts.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**:\n   - The task is evaluated by another LLM (via `eval_with_llm_judge`), which assesses based on predefined criteria for accuracy and clarity.\n   - This method assumes that the LLM judge can reliably evaluate spatial directions, which may have some limitations but generally can be suitable for straightforward cases.\n\n5. **Agent Success**:\n   - The agent succeeded at generating clear and coherent written directions based on the given map description.\n\n**Reasoning**:\n- Given the capabilities of current LLMs and the fact that the task involves interpreting clear textual descriptions and generating coherent directions, the success of the LLM in this task is within expected performance boundaries.\n- Although spatial reasoning adds a layer of complexity, the task's constraints and clear instructions make it feasible for a well-trained LLM to succeed.\n\nDecision: No"
