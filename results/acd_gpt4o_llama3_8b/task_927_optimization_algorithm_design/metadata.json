The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is a common and efficient data structure for representing graphs. We use Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem, which is a popular choice for single-source shortest path problems.\n\nDijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, where the priority of each node is its shortest distance from the source node. We initialize the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity. We then iteratively extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue and update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\nWe use a distance array to store the shortest distance from the source node to each node, and a parent array to store the parent of each node in the shortest path. We iterate n-1 times, where n is the number of nodes, to ensure that all nodes are visited.\n\nFinally, we check if a path is found from the source node to the destination node. If a path is found, we construct the shortest path by backtracking from the destination node to the source node using the parent array.\n\nThe time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(n^2 + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.

The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is the minimum distance from the start node to each node. We use a distance array to keep track of the minimum distance from the start node to each node, and a predecessor array to keep track of the node that led to the current node in the shortest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the distance array with infinity for all nodes, except for the start node which is set to 0. The predecessor array is initialized with null for all nodes.\n2. Create a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is the minimum distance from the start node to each node.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, pop the node with the minimum distance from the queue.\n4. For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, update its distance if the path through the current node is shorter.\n5. Mark the current node as visited and add it to the priority queue.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the priority queue is empty.\n7. Once the algorithm terminates, we can construct the shortest path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the predecessor array.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(|E|log|V|) where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices, making it efficient for large graphs. The space complexity is O(|V|) for the distance and predecessor arrays.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where the value at index [i][j] represents the distance from node i to node j.\n* The graph is connected, meaning there is a path between every pair of nodes.\n* The weights represent distances between nodes, and the goal is to find the shortest path between two nodes.",

It then enters a loop that continues until all nodes have been visited. In each iteration, it finds the node with the minimum distance that has not been visited yet and marks it as visited. It then updates the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\nThe time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(|E| + |V|log|V|) in the worst case, where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. This is because each edge is visited once, and the priority queue operations take O(log|V|) time.\n\nThe space complexity is O(|V|), as we need to store the distances and visited flags for each node.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where the value at index [i][j] represents the distance from node i to node j.\n* The graph is connected, and there is a path between the start and end nodes.\n* The weights are non-negative, and there are no negative cycles in the graph.",

Set the distance to the start node to 0, and all other distances to infinity.\n3. Iterate through each node in the graph, and for each node, iterate through each other node. If the distance to the current node is less than the distance to the other node plus the weight of the edge between them, update the distance to the other node and store the current node as its predecessor.\n4. Once all nodes have been visited, construct the shortest path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the `predecessors` array.\n5. Return the minimum distances and the shortest path.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges, because we are iterating through each node and each other node in the graph.

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, and it is particularly useful when the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** We initialize an array `distances` to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node, and an array `previous_nodes` to store the previous node in the shortest path to each node. We set the distance to the start node to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n2.  **Relaxation:** We iterate through the graph, relaxing each edge repeatedly. For each edge (u, v), if the distance to u plus the weight of the edge (u, v) is less than the current distance to v, we update the distance to v and store the previous node in the shortest path.\n3.  **Negative-weight cycle detection:** We check for negative-weight cycles by iterating through the graph again and checking if we can still improve the distance to any node. If we can, it means the graph contains a negative-weight cycle, and we raise an error.\n4.  **Shortest path construction:** We build the shortest path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the `previous_nodes` array.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(|E| \\* |V|), where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. This is because we relax each edge once, and we iterate through the vertices to build the shortest path. The space complexity is O(|V|), as we need to store the distances and previous nodes for each vertex."

We initialize the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity. We then iteratively extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue and update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\nWe use a distance array to store the shortest distance from the source node to each node, and a parent array to store the parent of each node in the shortest path. We iterate n-1 times, where n is the number of nodes, to ensure that all nodes are visited.\n\nFinally, we check if a path is found from the source node to the destination node. If a path is found, we construct the shortest path by backtracking from the destination node to the source node using the parent array.\n\nThe time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(n^2 + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.

The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is the minimum distance from the start node to each node. We use a distance array to keep track of the minimum distance from the start node to each node, and a predecessor array to keep track of the node that led to the current node in the shortest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize the distance array with infinity for all nodes, except for the start node which is set to 0. The predecessor array is initialized with null for all nodes.\n2. Create a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is the minimum distance from the start node to each node.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, pop the node with the minimum distance from the queue.\n4. For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, update its distance if the path through the current node is shorter.\n5. Mark the current node as visited and add it to the priority queue.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the priority queue is empty.\n7. Once the algorithm terminates, we can construct the shortest path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the predecessor array.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(|E|log|V|) where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices, making it efficient for large graphs. The space complexity is O(|V|) for the distance and predecessor arrays.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix where the value at index [i][j] represents the distance from node i to node j.\n* The graph is connected, meaning there is a path between every pair of nodes.\n* The weights represent distances between nodes, and the goal is to find the shortest path between two nodes.",

It works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, where the priority is the minimum distance from the start node to the current node.\n\nThe algorithm starts by initializing the distances array with infinity for all nodes except the start node, which is set to 0. It then enters a loop that continues until all nodes have been visited. In each iteration, it finds the node with the minimum distance that has not been visited yet and marks it as visited. It then updates the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\nThe time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(|E| + |V|log|V|) in the worst case, where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. This is because each edge is visited once, and the priority queue operations take O(log|V|) time.\n\nThe space complexity is O(|V|), as we need to store the distances and visited flags for each node.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where the value at index [i][j] represents the distance from node i to node j.\n* The graph is connected, and there is a path between the start and end nodes.\n* The weights are non-negative, and there are no negative cycles in the graph.",

Initialize an array `distances` to store the minimum distance from the start node to each node, and an array `predecessors` to store the predecessor of each node in the shortest path.\n2. Set the distance to the start node to 0, and all other distances to infinity.\n3. Iterate through each node in the graph, and for each node, iterate through each other node. If the distance to the current node is less than the distance to the other node plus the weight of the edge between them, update the distance to the other node and store the current node as its predecessor.\n4. Once all nodes have been visited, construct the shortest path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the `predecessors` array.\n5. Return the minimum distances and the shortest path.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2 * m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges, because we are iterating through each node and each other node in the graph. However, in practice, the algorithm is often faster because we are using a priority queue to select the next node to visit, which reduces the number of nodes we need to visit.\n\nAssumptions made:\n\n* The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where the value at index [i][j] represents the distance from node i to node j.\n* The weights represent distances between nodes.\n* If there is no direct path between nodes, the value is infinity.\n* The start and end nodes are valid indices in the graph.",

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, and it is particularly useful when the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** We initialize an array `distances` to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node, and an array `previous_nodes` to store the previous node in the shortest path to each node. We set the distance to the start node to 0 and all other distances to infinity.\n2.  **Relaxation:** We iterate through the graph, relaxing each edge repeatedly. For each edge (u, v), if the distance to u plus the weight of the edge (u, v) is less than the current distance to v, we update the distance to v and store the previous node in the shortest path.\n3.  **Negative-weight cycle detection:** We check for negative-weight cycles by iterating through the graph again and checking if we can still improve the distance to any node. If we can, it means the graph contains a negative-weight cycle, and we raise an error.\n4.  **Shortest path construction:** We build the shortest path by backtracking from the end node to the start node using the `previous_nodes` array.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(|E| \\* |V|), where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. This is because we relax each edge once, and we iterate through the vertices to build the shortest path. The space complexity is O(|V|), as we need to store the distances and previous nodes for each vertex."

This demonstrates significant capabilities in mathematical reasoning, algorithm design, and problem-solving, especially considering the complexity and requirement to handle edge cases.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
