Alice is not sitting at either end: This means that Alice is not at position 1 or position 5.\n3. Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana: This means that Diana must be at position 2 (since Bob is at the immediate right of Diana) and Bob is at position 3.\n\nHowever, we already established that Charlie is at position 3. This creates a conflict, as we cannot have both Bob and Charlie at position 3.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the clues. Since Charlie is in the middle, and Alice is not at either end, it's possible that Alice is at position 2, and Charlie is at position 3. But this would mean that Bob is not at position 3, since he's sitting to the immediate right of Diana.\n\nGiven the clues again, let's try a different arrangement. If Charlie is in the middle (position 3), and Alice is not at either end, then Alice could be at position 2.

            "To solve this puzzle, let's start by breaking down the clues.\n\n1. Alice is not sitting at either end: This means Alice can be in the 2nd or 3rd position.\n2. Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana: This means Diana and Bob are together, and they can be in the 2nd and 3rd positions, or the 3rd and 4th positions.\n3. Charlie is sitting in the middle: Since Charlie is in the middle, and there are 5 positions, Charlie must be in the 3rd position.\n\nConsidering the above points, we can conclude that Charlie must be in the 3rd position.\n\nSince Alice is not at either end and Charlie is in the 3rd position, and considering that Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana, the most likely arrangement is:\n\n- Diana and Bob are together, in the 2nd and 3rd positions, with Charlie in the 3rd position. But this would leave no room for Alice in the middle.\n- Alice in the 2nd position, Diana in the 3rd position, Bob in the 4th position, and Charlie in the 3rd position is not possible as it would mean bob is not sitting to the immediate right of Diana.\n- Alice in the 4th position, Diana in the 3rd position, Bob in the 2nd position, and Charlie in the 3rd position is not possible as it would mean bob is not sitting to the immediate right of Diana.\n\nBut considering that Charlie is in the 3rd position, and Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana, and Alice is not at either end, the arrangement where Alice is in the 2nd position, is the only logical possibility.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement is: Alice, Diana, Charlie, Bob, Eve.\n\nSince we do not know who is sitting at the 4th and 5th positions, we will place Eve in the 5th position.\n\nFinally, let's consider the remaining options. Since Alice is not at either end, Alice in the 2nd position is possible.\n\nSo, the logical arrangement is: Alice, Diana, Charlie, Bob, Eve.\n\nSolution: Alice, Diana, Charlie, Bob, Eve.",

Charlie is sitting in the middle.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know Charlie is in the middle, so the arrangement looks like this: _, _, Charlie, _, _\n\nSince Alice is not at either end (clue 1), and Charlie is in the middle, Alice must be in one of the two positions on the left side of Charlie.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know Bob is to the immediate right of Diana. Since Charlie is in the middle, Diana and Bob must be on the right side of Charlie. The only way for Bob to be to the immediate right of Diana is if Diana is in the third position (which is taken by Charlie) or in the second position. However, since Charlie is in the middle, Diana must be in the second position, and Bob must be in the fourth position.\n\nNow we have the arrangement: _, Diana, Charlie, Bob, _\n\nThe only position left is the first position, which must be taken by Alice (since she's not at either end, and the other positions are taken).

However, we've already determined that Bob and Diana occupy the second and third positions, so this is a conflict. We must revisit clue 2 and consider the possibility that Bob and Diana are not in the second and third positions.\n\nConsidering clue 2 again, if Bob is to the immediate right of Diana, and Charlie is in the middle, then Charlie must be in the third position, and Bob and Diana must occupy the second and fourth positions.

Therefore, we must place Alice at the fourth position, and Eve at the fifth position does not fit with the arrangement of Bob and Diana being next to Charlie.

The blue house is immediately to the left of the green house. This tells us that the blue and green houses must be adjacent to each other.\n\n3. Based on clue 1, let's try to place the yellow house at the leftmost position. This would make the sequence: yellow, ?, ?, ?.\n\n4. Since the blue house is immediately to the left of the green house, the green house must be the second last house in our sequence. This is because if we place the blue house at the start of the sequence, it would leave no room for the green house to be adjacent. This gives us: yellow, ?, green, ?.\n\n5. Now, we know the red house is not at either end. If we place the red house at the start of the sequence, it would contradict clue 1. Therefore, the red house must be the last house in our sequence.

            "To solve this puzzle, I will break it down step by step based on the given clues.\n\n1. Charlie is sitting in the middle: This means that Charlie is at position 3, since there are five positions in total.\n2. Alice is not sitting at either end: This means that Alice is not at position 1 or position 5.\n3. Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana: This means that Diana must be at position 2 (since Bob is at the immediate right of Diana) and Bob is at position 3.\n\nHowever, we already established that Charlie is at position 3. This creates a conflict, as we cannot have both Bob and Charlie at position 3.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the clues. Since Charlie is in the middle, and Alice is not at either end, it's possible that Alice is at position 2, and Charlie is at position 3. But this would mean that Bob is not at position 3, since he's sitting to the immediate right of Diana.\n\nGiven the clues again, let's try a different arrangement. If Charlie is in the middle (position 3), and Alice is not at either end, then Alice could be at position 2. This would leave Bob and Diana to be placed at the remaining positions.\n\nIf Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana, then Diana must be at position 2, and Bob is at position 3, which is not possible since Charlie is at position 3.\n\nHowever, we can place Diana at position 2, and then place Alice at position 4. This would leave Bob at position 1, and Eve at position 5.\n\nSolution: Eve, Bob, Charlie, Alice, Diana",
            "To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:\n\n1. Alice is not sitting at either end.\n2. Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana.\n3. Charlie is sitting in the middle.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know Alice is not at positions 1 or 5. This leaves us with positions 2, 3, and 4 for Alice.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana. This means that Diana must be at position 2, and Bob must be at position 3.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know Charlie is sitting in the middle. Since the middle position is position 3, and we already know Bob is at position 3, this means Charlie is actually at position 3, not Bob. However, this creates a contradiction with our previous conclusion that Bob is at position 3. Therefore, our initial assumption that Diana is at position 2 and Bob is at position 3 must be incorrect.\n\nLet's re-examine the clues. If Charlie is in the middle, then Charlie must be at position 3. This means Bob and Diana must be at positions 2 and 4, respectively, in some order. However, clue 2 states that Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana, which means Bob must be at position 4, and Diana must be at position 2.\n\nNow, we can conclude that Alice is not at either end, but since positions 2 and 4 are taken by Diana and Bob, Alice must be at position 1 or 5.

            "To solve this puzzle, let's start by breaking down the clues.\n\n1. Alice is not sitting at either end: This means Alice can be in the 2nd or 3rd position.\n2. Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana: This means Diana and Bob are together, and they can be in the 2nd and 3rd positions, or the 3rd and 4th positions.\n3. Charlie is sitting in the middle: Since Charlie is in the middle, and there are 5 positions, Charlie must be in the 3rd position.\n\nConsidering the above points, we can conclude that Charlie must be in the 3rd position.\n\nSince Alice is not at either end and Charlie is in the 3rd position, and considering that Bob is sitting to the immediate right of Diana, the most likely arrangement is:\n\n- Diana and Bob are together, in the 2nd and 3rd positions, with Charlie in the 3rd position.

Since Charlie is in the middle, Diana and Bob must be on the right side of Charlie. The only way for Bob to be to the immediate right of Diana is if Diana is in the third position (which is taken by Charlie) or in the second position.

The blue house is immediately to the left of the green house.\n3. The yellow house is at one end.\n\nSince the yellow house is at one end, it must be at the left end (because the red house is not at either end). This leaves the right end for the other two houses.\n\nNow, let's consider the blue and green houses. Since the blue house is immediately to the left of the green house, they must be adjacent to each other.\n\nGiven that the yellow house is at the left end, the blue and green houses must be to its right.

Given the blue house is to the left of the green house, and the yellow house is at one end, the blue house must be at the other end.

The red house is not at either end, but since the yellow and blue houses occupy the ends, the red house must be in the middle.\n6. The green house is to the right of the blue house, and since the blue house is at one end, the green house must be at the other end, which means the yellow house is at the left end and the green house is at the right end.\n7.

LLMs are generally good at pattern recognition and logical inference to an extent, but spatial reasoning can be challenging as it often requires visual or more complex logical structuring that goes beyond textual clues.\n   \n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, indicating that it involves non-trivial deduction and careful consideration of the clues provided.\n\n3. **Agent Success**: The LLM agent succeeded in solving the puzzle based on the given clues.\n\n4. **Code Implementation**: The code implementation appears correct and ensures that the agent's solution is evaluated against the given criteria using an LLM judge. The use of an LLM judge is appropriate for evaluating the format and logical correctness of the submission.\n\nConsidering the typical challenges LLMs face with spatial reasoning and the fact that this task is deemed difficult for humans, the agent's success in this task is indeed noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
