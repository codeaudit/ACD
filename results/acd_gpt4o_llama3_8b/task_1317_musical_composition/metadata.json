Your content should include the following comedic elements: slapstick, wordplay, unexpected twist. Ensure that the humor is clear, engaging, and incorporates all the specified elements.

For each element, check if it is the start of a sequence by verifying if the previous element is not in the set. If it is the start, count the length of the sequence by checking consecutive elements in the set.
