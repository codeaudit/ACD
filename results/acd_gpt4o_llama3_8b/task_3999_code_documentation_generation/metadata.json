            "Purpose:\nThe purpose of this code is to generate the nth Fibonacci number, a number in the Fibonacci sequence that appears at a specific position.\n\nFunctionality:\nThe code defines a recursive function called `fibonacci(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The function uses recursion to calculate the nth number by calling itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches the base cases of `n <= 0` or `n == 1`, at which point it returns 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nUsage:\nTo use this code, simply call the `fibonacci(n)` function with the desired position `n` of the Fibonacci number you want to generate. For example:\n\n* `fibonacci(0)` returns 0\n* `fibonacci(1)` returns 1\n* `fibonacci(2)` returns 1 (0 + 1)\n* `fibonacci(3)` returns 2 (1 + 1)\n* `fibonacci(4)` returns 3 (1 + 2)\n* `fibonacci(5)` returns 5 (2 + 3)\n\nNote that this implementation uses a recursive approach, which can be less efficient for large values of `n` due to the repeated calculations involved. A more efficient implementation would use an iterative approach or memoization to store previously calculated values.",
            "Purpose:\nThe purpose of the provided code is to generate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nFunctionality:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This code defines a recursive function, fibonacci(n), that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a bottom-up approach. It first checks for base cases where n is 0 or 1, in which case it directly returns 0 and 1 respectively. For any other value of n, it recursively calls the function to calculate the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers and returns their sum.\n\nUsage:\nTo use this code, simply call the fibonacci(n) function, passing the desired position of the Fibonacci number as an integer. The function will return the corresponding Fibonacci number. For example:\n- To generate the 5th Fibonacci number, call fibonacci(5).\n- To generate the 8th Fibonacci number, call fibonacci(8).\n\nNote: While the code works for small values of n, it's not efficient for large values due to its recursive nature and repeated calculations. A more efficient approach would be to use an iterative method or memoization to store and reuse previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.",

The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. It first checks if n is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 0, as the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0. If n is 1, it returns 1, as the first number in the sequence is 1. For any other value of n, it recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2, adding the results together to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nUsage:\nTo use this code, you can call the fibonacci function with an integer argument representing the position of the Fibonacci number you want to generate.

            "**Fibonacci Number Generator Documentation**\n\n**1. Purpose**\nThe purpose of this code is to generate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n**2. Functionality**\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This code defines a recursive function `fibonacci(n)` that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the code works:\n\n- If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0, since the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0.\n- If `n` is 1, the function returns 1, which is the second number in the Fibonacci sequence.\n- For any `n` greater than 1, the function calls itself recursively with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of these two values. This is because each Fibonacci number is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n\n**3. Usage**\nTo use this code, simply call the `fibonacci(n)` function with the desired position of the Fibonacci number as an argument. For example:\n\n```python\nprint(fibonacci(10))  # Generate the 10th Fibonacci number\n```\n\nNote that this implementation uses recursion, which can be inefficient for large values of `n` due to repeated calculations. For larger values of `n`, consider using an iterative approach or memoization to improve performance.\n\n**Example Use Cases:**\n\n- Generating the first few Fibonacci numbers: `fibonacci(0)`, `fibonacci(1)`, `fibonacci(2)`\n- Calculating specific Fibonacci numbers: `fibonacci(8)`, `fibonacci(12)`, `fibonacci(20)`",
