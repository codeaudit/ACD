Then, we will use the eigendecomposition to diagonalize A. Finally, we will use the diagonalized matrix to compute the square root of A.\n\nStep 1: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A\nTo compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, we will use the following formula:\n\u03bb = det(A - \u03bbI) = 0\nwhere I is the identity matrix and det denotes the determinant.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of A is:\np(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 6\u03bb^2 - 8\u03bb + 3\n\nWe can factor the characteristic polynomial as:\np(\u03bb) = -(\u03bb - 3)(\u03bb - 1)(\u03bb - 1)\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of A are \u03bb = 3, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bb = 1.\n\nNext, we need to compute the corresponding eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. An eigenvector x corresponding to an eigenvalue \u03bb satisfies the equation Ax = \u03bbx.\n\nFor \u03bb = 3, we have:\nAx = 3x\nWe can solve for x as:\nx = [1, 1, 0]^T\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, we have:\nAx = x\nWe can solve for x as:\nx = [1, 0, 1]^T\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, we have:\nAx = x\nWe can solve for x as:\nx = [0, 1, 0]^T\n\nStep 2: Use the eigendecomposition to diagonalize A\nThe eigendecomposition of A is given by:\nA = VDV^(-1)\nwhere V is the matrix of eigenvectors, D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and V^(-1) is the inverse of V.\n\nWe can construct the matrix V as:\nV = [x_1, x_2, x_3]\nwhere x_1, x_2, and x_3 are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \u03bb = 3, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bb = 1, respectively.\n\nWe can construct the diagonal matrix D as:\nD = [3, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1]\n\nStep 3: Compute the square root of A\nTo compute the square root of A, we can use the following formula:\n\u221aA = V\u221aD V^(-1)\nwhere \u221aD is the diagonal matrix of square roots of the eigenvalues.\n\nWe can compute the square roots of the eigenvalues as:\n\u221a3 = \u221a3\n\u221a1 = \u221a1\n\u221a1 = \u221a1\n\nWe can construct the diagonal matrix \u221aD as:\n\u221aD = [\u221a3, 0, 0; 0, \u221a1, 0; 0, 0, \u221a1]\n\nFinally, we can compute the square root of A as:\n\u221aA = V\u221aD V^(-1)\n= [1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0] [\u221a3, 0, 0; 0, \u221a1, 0; 0, 0, \u221a1] [1, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1; 1, 0, 0]\n= [[\u221a3, 1, 0], [1, \u221a1, 1], [0, 1, \u221a1]]",

The company wants to determine the minimum production cost to produce 1000 units. However, there are two types of production costs: fixed costs and variable costs. The fixed costs are a constant $100,000, and the variable costs are given by the function C(x). If the company produces 1000 units, find the minimum value of the total cost function, TC(x), which includes both fixed and variable costs.\n\nSolution: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the value of the total cost function TC(x) when x = 1000 and then find the minimum value of this function.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the variable cost function C(x) for x = 1000.\n\nC(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 3x + 10\nC(1000) = 2(1000)^3 + 5(1000)^2 - 3(1000) + 10\nC(1000) = 2,000,000,000 + 5,000,000 - 3,000 + 10\nC(1000) = 2,005,009,010\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fixed cost.

The particle's acceleration is given by the derivative of the velocity function, a(t) = v'(t) = (-2cos(t), -3sin(t)). If the particle starts at the point (2, 0) at time t = 0, find the particle's position, velocity, and acceleration at time t = 1.\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we will first find the position function, then the velocity function, and finally the acceleration function. We will then use these functions to find the particle's position, velocity, and acceleration at time t = 1.\n\nStep 1: Find the position function r(t)\nThe position function r(t) is given by the equation r(t) = (2cos(t), 3sin(t)). This is a parametric equation that describes the particle's position in terms of time t.\n\nStep 2: Find the velocity function v(t)\nThe velocity function v(t) is the derivative of the position function r(t). To find the derivative, we will use the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of cos(t) is -sin(t) and the derivative of sin(t) is cos(t). Therefore, v(t) = r'(t) = (-2sin(t), 3cos(t)).\n\nStep 3: Find the acceleration function a(t)\nThe acceleration function a(t) is the derivative of the velocity function v(t). To find the derivative, we will use the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of sin(t) is cos(t) and the derivative of cos(t) is -sin(t). Therefore, a(t) = v'(t) = (-2cos(t), -3sin(t)).\n\nStep 4: Find the particle's position at time t = 1\nTo find the particle's position at time t = 1, we will substitute t = 1 into the position function r(t). This gives us r(1) = (2cos(1), 3sin(1)).\n\nStep 5: Find the particle's velocity at time t = 1\nTo find the particle's velocity at time t = 1, we will substitute t = 1 into the velocity function v(t).

This gives us a(1) = (-2cos(1), -3sin(1)).\n\nNow, let's calculate the values of r(1), v(1), and a(1) using a calculator.\n\nr(1) = (2cos(1), 3sin(1)) \u2248 (0.54, 2.60)\nv(1) = (-2sin(1), 3cos(1)) \u2248 (-1.80, 1.21)\na(1) = (-2cos(1), -3sin(1)) \u2248 (1.80, -2.60)\n\nTherefore, the particle's position at time t = 1 is approximately (0.54, 2.60), the particle's velocity at time t = 1 is approximately (-1.80, 1.21), and the particle's acceleration at time t = 1 is approximately (1.80, -2.60).\n\nAnswer: \nThe final answer is not a single number, but rather a set of values for the particle's position, velocity, and acceleration at time t = 1.",

Finally, we will use the diagonalized matrix to compute the square root of A.\n\nStep 1: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A\nTo compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, we will use the following formula:\n\u03bb = det(A - \u03bbI) = 0\nwhere I is the identity matrix and det denotes the determinant.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of A is:\np(\u03bb) = det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 6\u03bb^2 - 8\u03bb + 3\n\nWe can factor the characteristic polynomial as:\np(\u03bb) = -(\u03bb - 3)(\u03bb - 1)(\u03bb - 1)\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of A are \u03bb = 3, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bb = 1.\n\nNext, we need to compute the corresponding eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. An eigenvector x corresponding to an eigenvalue \u03bb satisfies the equation Ax = \u03bbx.\n\nFor \u03bb = 3, we have:\nAx = 3x\nWe can solve for x as:\nx = [1, 1, 0]^T\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, we have:\nAx = x\nWe can solve for x as:\nx = [1, 0, 1]^T\n\nFor \u03bb = 1, we have:\nAx = x\nWe can solve for x as:\nx = [0, 1, 0]^T\n\nStep 2: Use the eigendecomposition to diagonalize A\nThe eigendecomposition of A is given by:\nA = VDV^(-1)\nwhere V is the matrix of eigenvectors, D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and V^(-1) is the inverse of V.\n\nWe can construct the matrix V as:\nV = [x_1, x_2, x_3]\nwhere x_1, x_2, and x_3 are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \u03bb = 3, \u03bb = 1, and \u03bb = 1, respectively.\n\nWe can construct the diagonal matrix D as:\nD = [3, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1]\n\nStep 3: Compute the square root of A\nTo compute the square root of A, we can use the following formula:\n\u221aA = V\u221aD V^(-1)\nwhere \u221aD is the diagonal matrix of square roots of the eigenvalues.\n\nWe can compute the square roots of the eigenvalues as:\n\u221a3 = \u221a3\n\u221a1 = \u221a1\n\u221a1 = \u221a1\n\nWe can construct the diagonal matrix \u221aD as:\n\u221aD = [\u221a3, 0, 0; 0, \u221a1, 0; 0, 0, \u221a1]\n\nFinally, we can compute the square root of A as:\n\u221aA = V\u221aD V^(-1)\n= [1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0] [\u221a3, 0, 0; 0, \u221a1, 0; 0, 0, \u221a1] [1, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1; 1, 0, 0]\n= [[\u221a3, 1, 0], [1, \u221a1, 1], [0, 1, \u221a1]]",
