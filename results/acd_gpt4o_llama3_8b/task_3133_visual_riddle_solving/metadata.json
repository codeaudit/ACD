            "Solution: \nTo solve this riddle, we need to take into account the different combinations of items the farmer can carry in the boat at any given time.\n\nStep 1: The farmer takes the goat across the river first and leaves it on the other side. Then, the farmer goes back to the original side to pick up the cabbage.\n\nStep 2: The farmer takes the cabbage across the river and leaves it with the goat on the other side. Then, the farmer goes back to the original side to pick up the wolf.\n\nStep 3: The farmer takes the wolf across the river, but he cannot leave it with the goat and cabbage because the wolf will eat the goat. So, the farmer takes the goat back to the original side, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the other side.\n\nStep 4: Once the goat is safely back on the original side, the farmer takes the goat across the river, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the other side. Then, the farmer picks up the goat again and takes it back to the original side.\n\nStep 5: The farmer takes the goat across the river one last time, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the other side. Then, the farmer picks up the goat again and takes it back to the original side.\n\nStep 6: Finally, the farmer takes the goat across the river one last time, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the other side. Now all three - the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage - are safely on the other side of the river.\n\nThis solution ensures that the wolf and the goat are never left together, and the goat and the cabbage are never left together.",
            "Solution: The farmer will first take the goat across the river and leave it on the other side. Then, the farmer will return to the original side and pick up the cabbage. The farmer will take the cabbage across the river and leave it on the other side with the goat, but then the farmer will take the goat back to the original side. Finally, the farmer will pick up the wolf and take it across the river, leaving it on the other side with the cabbage. The farmer will then return to the original side and pick up the goat, taking it across the river to join the wolf and the cabbage.",

We also know Bob does not live in the red house, but it does not say he can't live in the green or blue house. So, we can start by saying Alice lives in the blue house and Bob does not live in the red house. The only color left for Bob is green, and the only color left for Charlie is red.",
            "To solve this visual riddle, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. There are three houses in a row, each painted a different color: red, blue, and green.\n2. Alice lives in the blue house.\n3. Bob does not live in the red house.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that Alice lives in the blue house. It's not possible to determine the arrangement of the other two houses yet, as the information only specifies the color of Alice's house and the restriction on Bob's house.\n\nHowever, we can make an educated guess using process of elimination. Let's assign the houses to a row: house 1, house 2, and house 3.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have the following possibilities:\n\n- House 1: red, green, or blue (but we know Alice lives in the blue house)\n- House 2: red, green, or blue (can't be blue since Alice lives there)\n- House 3: red, green, or blue (can't be blue since Alice lives there)\n\nFrom statement 3, we know Bob does not live in the red house. Since Alice lives in the blue house, Bob can't live in the red house, but that's not our main concern. We have to determine the house colors for Bob and Charlie.\n\nLet's assign the red house to house 1 (as the first possible scenario):\n- House 1: red\n- House 2: green or blue\n- House 3: green or blue\n\nSince Alice lives in the blue house, and we know Bob can't live in the red house, we can conclude that:\n- Alice lives in the blue house.\n- Bob cannot live in house 1 (red) or house 2 (blue, because Alice lives there), so the only option left for Bob is house 3 (green).\n\nHowever, we need to verify if this solution is correct by considering the remaining option for the other house. Let's assign the red house to house 3 instead:\n- House 1: green or blue\n- House 2: red\n- House 3: green or blue\n\nSince Alice lives in the blue house, and we know Bob can't live in the red house, we can conclude that:\n- Alice lives in the blue house.\n- Bob cannot live in house 3 (red), so the only option left for Bob is house 2 (green).\n\nNow, we can determine Charlie's location:\n- Alice lives in the blue house.\n- Bob lives in the green house.\n- Therefore, Charlie lives in the red house.\n\nConsidering these two scenarios, we can conclude that the solution is as follows:\n\nSolution: Alice lives in the blue house, Bob lives in the green house, and Charlie lives in the red house.",

Since Alice is already in the blue house, and there's only one red house, Bob must live in the green house or the other house that hasn't been assigned. However, we can't assign Bob to the green house yet because we need one more house to be empty to accurately place Charlie. Therefore, Bob must live in the house that's not yet assigned, which is the house initially kept as \"Red\" or the green house.
