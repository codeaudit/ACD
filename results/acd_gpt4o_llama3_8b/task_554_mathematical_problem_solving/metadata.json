This involves expressing the quadratic equation in the form (x - a)(x - b) = 0, where a and b are the roots of the equation.\n\nFirst, we notice that the quadratic equation has a common factor of (x - 2). We can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)(x - 2) = 0\n\nNow, we can see that (x - 2) is a common factor in both terms of the equation. This means that x - 2 = 0 is a factor of the equation.\n\nTo find the roots of the equation, we can set x - 2 = 0 and solve for x. This gives us:\n\nx - 2 = 0\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, the only root of the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 is x = 2.\n\nThe final answer is: 2",
            "To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0, we will use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this equation, a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. Here, a is the coefficient of x^2, b is the coefficient of x, and c is the constant term.\n\nLet's identify the values of a, b, and c from the given quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\n\nHere, a = 1 (coefficient of x^2), b = -4 (coefficient of x), and c = 4 (constant term).\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-(-4) \u00b1 \u221a((-4)^2 - 4(1)(4))) / 2(1)\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a(16 - 16)) / 2\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a0) / 2\n\nNow, we simplify the expression by evaluating the square root:\n\nx = (4 \u00b1 \u221a0) / 2\nx = (4 \u00b1 0) / 2\nx = 4 / 2\n\nFinally, we evaluate the expression to get the roots of the equation:\n\nx = 4 / 2\nx = 2\n\nSince there is only one solution to the quadratic equation, we can conclude that this equation has a repeated root, or a double root. This is because the equation x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 can be factored as (x - 2)(x - 2) = 0, or (x - 2)^2 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the quadratic equation x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 is x = 2.\n\nAnswer: x = 2.",
