Here are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Creativity and Aesthetics**: This task demands creativity and the ability to arrange words in a visually aesthetic manner, which is not a straightforward task for an LLM. It requires not only understanding the meaning of words but also how their spatial arrangement can convey additional layers of meaning.\n\n2. **Linguistic Flexibility**: The ability to use given words in a coherent and meaningful way within the constraints of a theme shows advanced linguistic capabilities.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The task's success is determined by an LLM judge, which could be biased toward certain patterns or criteria that may not fully capture human aesthetic judgment. However, assuming the LLM judge is well-calibrated, success on this task would still be notable.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, meaning that an LLM succeeding at this task would be quite impressive.\n\n5. **Textual Representation of Visual Poetry**: Since the submission is in plain text, the challenge includes effectively using spaces, new lines, and indentation to represent visual poetry, which is a non-trivial task.\n\nConsidering these factors, the success of the LLM agent at this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
