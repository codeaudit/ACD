            "To solve this problem, I will first break it down into steps and then provide the solution.\n\nStep 1: \nLet's denote the number of non-fiction books as x and the number of fiction books as x + 40 since the bookstore sold 40 more fiction books than non-fiction books. We know that the total number of books sold is 120, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + (x + 40) = 120\n\nStep 2: \nNow, let's solve the equation step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we combine like terms:\nx + x + 40 = 120\nCombine x terms:\n2x + 40 = 120\n\nNext, subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:\n2x = 80\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\nx = 40\n\nSo, the number of non-fiction books sold is 40. Since the number of fiction books is 40 more than the number of non-fiction books, we can calculate the number of fiction books as follows:\nx + 40 = 40 + 40 = 80\n\nStep 3: \nTherefore, the bookstore sold 40 non-fiction books and 80 fiction books.\n\nAnswer: The bookstore sold 40 non-fiction books and 80 fiction books."
