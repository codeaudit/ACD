            "**Theorem Statement**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. It states that:\n\n**a**^2 + **b**^2 = **c**^2\n\nwhere **a** and **b** are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs) of a right triangle, and **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is significant because it allows us to calculate the length of the longest side (hypotenuse) of a right triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides, or vice versa. This theorem has numerous applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, architecture, and construction.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem can be explained by considering the areas of the squares formed by the sides of the right triangle. The theorem states that the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares (formed by the legs of the triangle) is equal to the area of the larger square (formed by the hypotenuse). This can be visualized as:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n\nwhere a\u00b2 is the area of the square formed by the length of side a, b\u00b2 is the area of the square formed by the length of side b, and c\u00b2 is the area of the square formed by the length of the hypotenuse c.\n\n**Example**\n\nConsider a right triangle with legs of length 3 inches and 4 inches. We want to find the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n1.  Identify the lengths of the legs of the right triangle: a = 3 inches, b = 4 inches.\n2.  Square the lengths of the legs: a\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9, b\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 = 16.\n3.  Add the squared lengths of the legs: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25.\n4.  Take the square root of the sum: \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = \u221a25 = 5.\n5.  The length of the hypotenuse is therefore 5 inches.\n\nThe final answer is: The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.",
            "**Theorem Statement**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. The theorem states:\n\n\"A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 = C\u00b2\"\n\nwhere A and B are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle, and C is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is a mathematical statement that has been in use for thousands of years, originating from the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. It is a crucial concept in geometry, as it allows us to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are known.\n\nThe theorem works by using the concept of squares and square roots. When a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 are added together, the result is equal to c\u00b2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse. This relationship holds true for all right-angled triangles.\n\n**Example**\n\nLet's consider a right-angled triangle with one leg measuring 3 inches and the other leg measuring 4 inches. We want to calculate the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n1. Identify the sides of the triangle: A = 3 inches, B = 4 inches\n2. Square the lengths of the two sides: A\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9, B\u00b2 = 4\u00b2 = 16\n3. Add the squared lengths together: 9 + 16 = 25\n4. Take the square root of the result: \u221a25 = 5\n5. The length of the hypotenuse (C) is equal to 5 inches.\n\nTherefore, the theorem holds true in this example, as 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 5\u00b2. The Pythagorean Theorem can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems, from building design to physics and engineering.",
            "The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b), as expressed by the formula a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2. This theorem has been widely used in various fields for calculating the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.",
            "**Theorem Statement**\nPythagorean Theorem: In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\na^2 + b^2 = c^2\n\n**Explanation**\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry and trigonometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

            "**Theorem Statement**\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) is a fundamental concept in calculus that establishes a deep connection between the derivative and the definite integral of a function. It states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes, and it provides a powerful tool for solving problems in physics, engineering, and other fields.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe FTC consists of two parts:\n\n1. The first part states that if a function F(x) is the definite integral of a function f(x) from a to x, then the derivative of F(x) with respect to x is equal to f(x).

Now, we can evaluate F(2) - F(0) = (1/3)(2)^3 - (1/3)(0)^3 = 8/3 - 0 = 8/3.\n4.

The first part states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. This means that if we have a function f(x) and we differentiate it, then we can integrate the result to obtain the original function f(x).\n2.

First, we need to find the antiderivative of f(x) = x^2. We can do this by using the power rule of integration, which states that \u222bx^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. In this case, n = 2, so we have:\n\n\u222bx^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C\n\n2.  Next, we need to evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit of integration, x = 4, and at the lower limit of integration, x = 0. We can do this by plugging in the values:\n\nF(4) = (4^3)/3 + C = 64/3 + C\n\nF(0) = (0^3)/3 + C = 0 + C\n\n3.  Now, we can plug these values into the formula for the definite integral, which states that:\n\n\u222b[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\nIn this case, a = 0 and b = 4, so we have:\n\n\u222b[0, 4] x^2 dx = F(4) - F(0)\n= (64/3 + C) - (0 + C)\n= 64/3\n\n4.  Therefore, the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 64/3.\n\n**Answer:** The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes.

            "**Theorem Statement**\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. In other words, it establishes a deep connection between the two operations, allowing us to compute definite integrals and find antiderivatives.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus consists of two main parts:\n\n1.  The first part states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. This means that if we have a function f(x) and we differentiate it, then we can integrate the result to obtain the original function f(x).\n2.  The second part states that the definite integral of a function f(x) from a to b can be computed as the difference between the antiderivative of f(x) evaluated at b and the antiderivative of f(x) evaluated at a. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\u222b[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\nwhere F(x) is the antiderivative of f(x).\n\nThe significance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is that it provides a powerful tool for solving problems in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields. It allows us to compute areas, volumes, and other quantities using definite integrals, and to model real-world phenomena using mathematical functions.\n\n**Example**\n\nSuppose we want to find the area under the curve y = f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 4.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown**\n\n1.  First, we need to find the antiderivative of f(x) = x^2. We can do this by using the power rule of integration, which states that \u222bx^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. In this case, n = 2, so we have:\n\n\u222bx^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C\n\n2.  Next, we need to evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit of integration, x = 4, and at the lower limit of integration, x = 0. We can do this by plugging in the values:\n\nF(4) = (4^3)/3 + C = 64/3 + C\n\nF(0) = (0^3)/3 + C = 0 + C\n\n3.  Now, we can plug these values into the formula for the definite integral, which states that:\n\n\u222b[a, b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\nIn this case, a = 0 and b = 4, so we have:\n\n\u222b[0, 4] x^2 dx = F(4) - F(0)\n= (64/3 + C) - (0 + C)\n= 64/3\n\n4.  Therefore, the area under the curve y = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 4 is 64/3.\n\n**Answer:** The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. In other words, it establishes a deep connection between the two operations, allowing us to compute definite integrals and find antiderivatives. It consists of two main parts: the first part states that differentiation and integration are inverse processes, and the second part states that the definite integral of a function f(x) from a to b can be computed as the difference between the antiderivative of f(x) evaluated at b and the antiderivative of f(x) evaluated at a. This theorem has significant implications in various fields and provides a powerful tool for solving problems in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields."

As long as the LLM can generate coherent text and follow the structure provided in the instructions, it has a good chance of scoring well.\n\nGiven these points, the LLM's success at explaining the Pythagorean Theorem is not particularly surprising or noteworthy, especially considering the theorem's fundamental nature and the LLM's capability to generate structured text based on instructions.\n\nDecision: No"
