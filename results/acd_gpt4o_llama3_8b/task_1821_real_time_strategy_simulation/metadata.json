We will continue to mine resources in the southern sector, ensuring a steady supply of resources for future upgrades and ship construction.\n\nMove 5: Based on the evolving situation, I will send a scouting party to the northern sector to gather more information about the enemy's movements and positions.

This will provide our fleet with necessary resources for future combat and ship upgrades.\n\nMove 2: Send one of our undamaged ships to scout the enemy fleet and provide information about their movements, numbers, and combat effectiveness. This will allow us to assess potential threats and opportunities for an advantageous engagement.\n\nMove 3: Begin building new ships using the resources gathered in the previous move. With a damaged ship in our fleet, we need to balance our resources between repairs and expansion. Creating a new ship will provide us with additional firepower and flexibility in case of an engagement.\n\nMove 4: Order our scouting ship to gather more information about the enemy fleet's composition and intentions. If the enemy is moving towards the northern sector, we should be prepared to defend our resource deposit or engage them in a strategic location.\n\nMove 5: Repair our damaged ship to restore its combat effectiveness. With a stronger fleet, we can now engage the enemy more confidently, either in the northern sector or by luring them towards our resource deposit. This will also give us a better chance of defending our interests and securing the planet's resources.",

Meanwhile, send a repair team to mend the damaged ship to restore its combat effectiveness.\n\nMove 3: As the enemy fleet approaches, focus on reinforcing the defensive line with the repaired ship and a new ship constructed using available resources. Deploy the remaining 2 ships to reinforce the defense line, ensuring a 4-3 advantage in the sector.\n\nMove 4: Allocate resources to construct additional ships to further bolster the defense line, aiming for a 6-3 advantage. Continue to monitor the enemy fleet's movements and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\nMove 5: With a stronger defensive position, prepare for a pre-emptive strike on the enemy fleet, aiming to weaken their forces before they reach the resource-rich planet. Send a group of ships to disrupt their formation and create an opening for a decisive battle.",
            "Move 1: Mine the resource deposit in the southern sector to gather resources that will aid in ship maintenance and upgrades. This also gives us a strategic resource advantage, allowing us to potentially repair our damaged ship or upgrade our fleet to counter the enemy's increasing threat.\n\nMove 2: Rebuild and upgrade our damaged ship to prevent it from becoming a liability in combat. This upgrade will restore its combat effectiveness, ensuring it can contribute meaningfully to our defense strategy. With our resources acquired from the southern sector, we can also consider starting to build additional ships.\n\nMove 3: Produce additional ships to bolster our fleet numbers. Given that the enemy is moving towards the northern sector, and we're still assessing our resource availability, building our fleet in the southern sector allows us to prepare a defense strategy while the enemy is not yet in a position to engage us effectively. Building more ships provides us with a strategic edge in case the enemy pushes towards our position.\n\nMove 4: Position one of our newly built ships to act as a sentry in the northern sector, close to the reported enemy fleet movement. This allows us to gather early intelligence on the enemy's numbers, composition, and movements. It also allows us to potentially intercept any enemy forces before they engage our main fleet.\n\nMove 5: With additional ships produced and our forces in place, we position our fleet to defend our resource deposit in the southern sector. We also allocate resources to upgrade our main fleet to counter the anticipated enemy force. This final move sets the stage for potential combat with the enemy as they move towards our positions, allowing us to confront them on our terms or retreat and regroup according to the evolving situation."
