It requires not just linguistic transformation but also a deep understanding of both source and target cultures.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Modern LLMs are highly proficient in natural language understanding and translation tasks. They have been trained on vast corpora that include a wide range of idiomatic expressions and cultural contexts. Therefore, they can often generate contextually appropriate translations.\n\n3. **Automatic Evaluation**: The task uses an LLM judge to evaluate the translations. While LLM judges can be effective, they might not always perfectly capture the nuances of idiomatic expressions and cultural contexts. However, assuming the LLM judge is well-calibrated, it should be able to provide a reasonable assessment.\n\n4. **Success on Task**: Given the proficiency of current LLMs in handling natural language tasks, it is expected that an advanced LLM could succeed at this task. The success would involve producing idiomatic translations that maintain the intended meaning and cultural appropriateness.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent in translating idiomatic expressions accurately is not particularly surprising.
