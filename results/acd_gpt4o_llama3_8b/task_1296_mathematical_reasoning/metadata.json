To find the total time, we'll add the times for each leg of the journey:\n\nTotal Time = 4 hours + 4.88 hours = 8.88 hours\n\nNow, we can calculate the average speed:\n\nAverage Speed = 440 miles / 8.88 hours \u2248 49.55 miles per hour\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is approximately 49.55 miles per hour.\n\nAnswer: 49.55",

Calculate the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.\n\nThe car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 55 miles per hour. To calculate the time taken for this leg of the journey, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the first leg of the journey, the distance is 220 miles and the speed is 55 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken for this leg of the journey is:\n\nTime = 220 miles / 55 miles per hour = 4 hours\n\nOn its way back from City B to City A, the car travels at an average speed of 45 miles per hour. To calculate the time taken for this leg of the journey, we can use the same formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the second leg of the journey, the distance is 220 miles and the speed is 45 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken for this leg of the journey is:\n\nTime = 220 miles / 45 miles per hour = 4.89 hours (approximately)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total distance traveled.\n\nSince the car travels from City A to City B and then back to City A, the total distance traveled is simply twice the distance between the two cities, which is:\n\nTotal Distance = 2 x 220 miles = 440 miles\n\nStep 3: Calculate the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nTo calculate the average speed for the entire trip, we can use the formula:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nWe already calculated the total distance traveled in Step 2, which is 440 miles. To calculate the total time taken for the entire trip, we need to add the time taken for each leg of the journey:\n\nTotal Time = Time taken for first leg + Time taken for second leg\n= 4 hours + 4.89 hours\n= 8.89 hours (approximately)\n\nNow we can calculate the average speed for the entire trip:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n= 440 miles / 8.89 hours\n= 49.44 miles per hour (approximately)\n\nTherefore, the average speed for the entire trip is approximately 49.44 miles per hour.\n\nAnswer: 49.44 miles per hour.",
