            "Solution: We can use a divide-and-conquer approach to solve this problem efficiently. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. First weighing: Place 4 balls on each side of the balance scale. There are three possible outcomes:\n   - If one side is heavier, the odd ball is among the 4 balls on that side.\n   - If the other side is heavier, the odd ball is among the 4 balls on that side.\n   - If the two sides are balanced, the odd ball is among the 4 balls not on the scale.\n\n2.

Final weighing (if the second weighing indicates the odd ball is among the 2 balls on one side): Place the two balls on one side of the balance scale. The odd ball will be the one that is either heavier or lighter.\n\nBy following this plan, we can determine the odd ball and whether it is heavier or lighter in 3 weighings.",
            "Solution: 3\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. Weigh 4 balls against 4 balls on the balance scale. There are three possible outcomes:\n   - The two sides balance, which means the odd ball is among the 4 balls not on the scale.\n   - One side is heavier, which means the odd ball is on the heavier side.\n   - One side is lighter, which means the odd ball is on the lighter side.\n\n2. If the two sides balance, we can repeat the process with the 4 balls not on the scale in step 1. Weigh 2 of these balls against 2. Again, there are three possible outcomes:\n   - The two sides balance, which means the odd ball is among the 2 balls not on the scale.\n   - One side is heavier, which means the odd ball is on the heavier side.\n   - One side is lighter, which means the odd ball is on the lighter side.\n\n3. If the two sides do not balance in step 1, we can identify the odd ball as being on the heavier or lighter side. We can then repeat the process with the 4 balls not on the scale in step 1 to determine whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we need to perform 2 weighings with 4 balls and 1 weighing with 2 balls to identify the odd ball and determine whether it is heavier or lighter. This gives us a total of 3 weighings.",
            "Solution: 3 weighings are sufficient to identify the odd ball and whether it is heavier or lighter. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\nWeighing 1: \n- Divide the 12 balls into 3 groups of 4 balls each. \n- Weigh 2 groups against each other. \n- If one side is heavier, then the odd ball is in the heavier group. If not, then the odd ball is in the group that was not weighed.\n\nWeighing 2: \n- Take the group from the first weighing that we suspect contains the odd ball. \n- Divide this group into 2 subgroups of 2 balls each. \n- Weigh the 2 subgroups against each other. \n- If one side is heavier, then the odd ball is in the heavier subgroup.

If not, then the other ball is the odd ball. \n\nWith these 3 weighings, we can determine whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter and identify which ball it is.",
            "Solution: 3\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **First weighing:** Divide the 12 balls into 3 groups of 4 balls each.

There are three possible outcomes:\n   - The two groups balance each other: This means the odd ball is in the third group.\n   - One group is heavier: The odd ball is in the heavier group.\n   - One group is lighter: The odd ball is in the lighter group.\n\n2. **Second weighing (if the first weighing resulted in an imbalance):** Take one of the two groups that were weighed against each other and divide it into two equal parts of 2 balls each. Weigh one part against the other. If one part is heavier, the odd ball is in that part; otherwise, the odd ball is in the other part.\n\n3. **Third weighing (if necessary):** Take the two balls from the last weighing and weigh one against the other.

If they balance each other, the odd ball is the one that was not weighed.\n\nThis plan ensures that we can identify the odd ball and whether it's heavier or lighter in just 3 weighings.\n\nThe reasoning behind this plan is that we use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities with each weighing.

There are two possible outcomes:\n   - If one side is heavier, the odd ball is the heavier ball on that side.\n   - If the other side is heavier, the odd ball is the heavier ball on that side.\n   - If the two sides are balanced, the odd ball is the lighter ball.\n\n3. Second weighing (if the first weighing indicates the odd ball is among the 4 balls not on the scale): Place 3 balls on one side and 1 ball on the other side of the balance scale. There are two possible outcomes:\n   - If the side with 3 balls is heavier, the odd ball is the lighter ball.\n   - If the side with 1 ball is heavier, the odd ball is the heavier ball.\n\n4. Final weighing (if the second weighing indicates the odd ball is among the 2 balls on one side): Place the two balls on one side of the balance scale. The odd ball will be the one that is either heavier or lighter.\n\nBy following this plan, we can determine the odd ball and whether it is heavier or lighter in 3 weighings.",
            "Solution: 3\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. Weigh 4 balls against 4 balls on the balance scale. There are three possible outcomes:\n   - The two sides balance, which means the odd ball is among the 4 balls not on the scale.\n   - One side is heavier, which means the odd ball is on the heavier side.\n   - One side is lighter, which means the odd ball is on the lighter side.\n\n2. If the two sides balance, we can repeat the process with the 4 balls not on the scale in step 1. Weigh 2 of these balls against 2. Again, there are three possible outcomes:\n   - The two sides balance, which means the odd ball is among the 2 balls not on the scale.\n   - One side is heavier, which means the odd ball is on the heavier side.\n   - One side is lighter, which means the odd ball is on the lighter side.\n\n3. If the two sides do not balance in step 1, we can identify the odd ball as being on the heavier or lighter side. We can then repeat the process with the 4 balls not on the scale in step 1 to determine whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, we need to perform 2 weighings with 4 balls and 1 weighing with 2 balls to identify the odd ball and determine whether it is heavier or lighter. This gives us a total of 3 weighings.",
            "Solution: 3 weighings are sufficient to identify the odd ball and whether it is heavier or lighter. \n\nHere's the plan:\n\nWeighing 1: \n- Divide the 12 balls into 3 groups of 4 balls each. \n- Weigh 2 groups against each other. \n- If one side is heavier, then the odd ball is in the heavier group. If not, then the odd ball is in the group that was not weighed.\n\nWeighing 2: \n- Take the group from the first weighing that we suspect contains the odd ball. \n- Divide this group into 2 subgroups of 2 balls each. \n- Weigh the 2 subgroups against each other. \n- If one side is heavier, then the odd ball is in the heavier subgroup. If not, then the odd ball is in the lighter subgroup.\n\nWeighing 3: \n- Take the subgroup from the second weighing that we suspect contains the odd ball. \n- Weigh 1 ball against the other. \n- If one ball is heavier, then it's the odd ball. If not, then the other ball is the odd ball. \n\nWith these 3 weighings, we can determine whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter and identify which ball it is.",
            "Solution: 3\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1. **First weighing:** Divide the 12 balls into 3 groups of 4 balls each. Weigh two of these groups against each other on the balance scale. There are three possible outcomes:\n   - The two groups balance each other: This means the odd ball is in the third group.\n   - One group is heavier: The odd ball is in the heavier group.\n   - One group is lighter: The odd ball is in the lighter group.\n\n2. **Second weighing (if the first weighing resulted in an imbalance):** Take one of the two groups that were weighed against each other and divide it into two equal parts of 2 balls each. Weigh one part against the other. If one part is heavier, the odd ball is in that part; otherwise, the odd ball is in the other part.\n\n3. **Third weighing (if necessary):** Take the two balls from the last weighing and weigh one against the other. If one ball is heavier, it's the odd ball. If they balance each other, the odd ball is the one that was not weighed.\n\nThis plan ensures that we can identify the odd ball and whether it's heavier or lighter in just 3 weighings.\n\nThe reasoning behind this plan is that we use the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities with each weighing. By dividing the balls into groups and comparing them, we can quickly eliminate certain possibilities and focus on a smaller subset of balls. This approach minimizes the number of weighings required to solve the problem.",
            "To solve this problem, we need to use a divide-and-conquer approach to minimize the number of weighings required. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Weighing 1**: Weigh 4 balls against 4 balls on the balance scale. There are three possible outcomes:\n\t* If the two sides are balanced, the odd ball is one of the 4 balls not on the scale. (We'll call this the \"unweighed group.\")\n\t* If one side is heavier, the odd ball is on the heavier side.\n\t* If one side is lighter, the odd ball is on the lighter side.\n2. **Weighing 2**: If the scale is balanced, we'll weigh 3 balls from the unweighed group against 3 balls from the unweighed group. This will help us narrow down which specific ball is the odd one. If the scale is not balanced, we'll proceed with weighing the unweighed group against the heavier or lighter side from the first weighing.\n3. **Weighing 3**: If the second weighing is balanced, we'll weigh 2 balls from the unweighed group against the single remaining ball. If the scale is balanced, the remaining ball is the odd one. If not, we'll determine whether it's heavier or lighter based on the previous weighing.\n4. **Weighing 4 (optional)**: If the third weighing is not balanced, we can use the result of the previous weighing to determine whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.\n\nHowever, we can actually solve the problem in just 3 weighings.\n\nHere's the corrected plan:\n\n1. **Weighing 1**: Weigh 4 balls against 4 balls on the balance scale.\n2. **Weighing 2**: If the scale is balanced, we'll weigh 3 balls from the unweighed group against 3 balls from the unweighed group.\n3. **Weighing 3**: If the second weighing is balanced, we'll weigh 2 balls from the unweighed group against the single remaining ball. If the scale is balanced, the remaining ball is the odd one. If not, we'll determine whether it's heavier or lighter based on the previous weighing.\n4. For the 3 weighings combined, we can determine the odd ball and whether it's heavier or lighter by analyzing the results of the weighings.\n\nLet's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n* If the first weighing is balanced, the odd ball is one of the 4 balls not on the scale. The second weighing will help us identify which 4 balls those are. The third weighing will determine the odd ball and whether it's heavier or lighter.\n* If the first weighing is not balanced, we can determine whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter based on which side is heavier or lighter.\n\nThis approach allows us to determine the odd ball and whether it's heavier or lighter in just 3 weighings.\n\nAnswer: 3"
