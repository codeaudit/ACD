Your analogy should be meaningful, illustrate a clear and non-superficial connection between the two domains, and should not be a common clichÃ©. The analogy should highlight a specific aspect or principle that is common to both domains. Additionally, provide a detailed explanation that describes the similarity and how the analogy works.

Domain 1: {t['domain1']}
Domain 2: {t['domain2']}

Example:
Domain 1: Gardening
Domain 2: Software Development
Analogy: Tending to a garden is like maintaining software.
Explanation: Just as a gardener must regularly water, prune, and care for plants to keep a garden healthy, a software developer must continually update, debug, and optimize code to ensure a software application runs smoothly. Both require ongoing attention and adaptation to changing conditions.

Submit your response as a plain text string in the following format:
Analogy: [Your analogy]
Explanation: [Your detailed explanation]"""
