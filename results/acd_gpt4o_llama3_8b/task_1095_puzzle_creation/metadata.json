This involves both creative and logical processes, which are difficult to balance.\n  \n2. **Complexity and Constraints**: The constraints (e.g., grid size, interconnectivity) add a layer of complexity, making it a non-trivial task even for advanced LLMs.\n\n3. **Examples and Instructions**: The provided instructions are clear, and the example gives a concrete format to follow, which helps in guiding the LLM.
