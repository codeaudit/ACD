Rearranging the equation to solve for a gives a = (v - u) / t.\n\nStep 2: Substitute the given values into the equation to find the acceleration: a = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 5 s = 4 m/s^2.\n\nStep 3: Next, we need to find the distance traveled during the constant velocity phase.

We need to find the maximum height (h_max) reached by the projectile, the total time of flight (t_flight), and the horizontal range (R).\n\nStep 2: To find the maximum height, we need to use the equation for the vertical component of the projectile's motion: h = v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t^2, where v0y is the initial vertical velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time. Since the projectile is launched at an angle of 45 degrees, the initial vertical velocity (v0y) is v0*sin(45 degrees) = 30*sin(45 degrees) = 21.21 m/s.\n\nStep 3: To find the maximum height, we need to find the time at which the vertical velocity is zero. We can use the equation v = v0y - g*t to find the time: 0 = 21.21 - 9.8*t. Solving for t, we get t = 21.21/9.8 = 2.17 seconds.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have the time, we can find the maximum height using the equation from Step 2: h_max = v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t^2 = 21.21*2.17 - (1/2)*9.8*(2.17)^2 = 46.03 m.\n\nStep 5: To find the total time of flight, we need to find the time at which the projectile hits the ground. We can use the equation h = v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t^2, where h is the height at which the projectile hits the ground (0 m). Solving for t, we get 0 = 21.21*t - (1/2)*9.8*t^2. This is a quadratic equation, and solving it, we get two solutions: t = 0 and t = 4.38 seconds. The total time of flight is the difference between these two times: t_flight = 4.38 - 0 = 4.38 seconds.\n\nStep 6: To find the horizontal range, we can use the equation R = v0x*t_flight, where v0x is the initial horizontal velocity (v0*cos(45 degrees)) and t_flight is the total time of flight. We already found v0x = 30*cos(45 degrees) = 21.21 m/s.

We can use trigonometry to find the components of the initial velocity.\nv0x = v0 * cos(\u03b8) = 30 * cos(45\u00b0) = 30 * 0.707 = 21.21 m/s (horizontal component)\nv0y = v0 * sin(\u03b8) = 30 * sin(45\u00b0) = 30 * 0.707 = 21.21 m/s (vertical component)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the time of flight to the maximum height.\nSince the vertical component of the velocity is the only contributing factor at the maximum height, we can use the equation for time under constant acceleration to find the time to reach the maximum height:\nt_max = v0y / g\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.81 m/s^2.\nt_max = 21.21 / 9.81 = 2.16 seconds\n\nStep 3: Calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile.\nUsing the equation for the maximum height:\nh_max = (v0y)^2 / (2g)\nh_max = (21.21)^2 / (2 * 9.81) = 221.95 / 19.62 = 11.31 meters\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total time of flight.\nTo find the total time of flight, we can use the equation for the time of flight:\nt_total = 2 * t_max\nSince the time to reach the maximum height and the time to fall back down are equal, the total time of flight is twice the time to reach the maximum height.\nt_total = 2 * 2.16 = 4.32 seconds\n\nStep 5: Calculate the horizontal range of the projectile.\nThe horizontal range can be calculated using the equation:\nR = v0x * t_total\nR = 21.21 * 4.32 = 91.69 meters\n\nFinal Answer: \nMaximum height: 11.31 meters\nTotal time of flight: 4.32 seconds\nHorizontal range: 91.69 meters",
            "Step 1: Identify the given parameters of the problem.\nThe initial velocity (v0) is 30 m/s, the angle of projection (\u03b8) is 45 degrees, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.8 m/s^2. We assume the acceleration due to gravity is acting in the negative y-direction.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the vertical and horizontal components of the initial velocity.\nThe vertical component of the initial velocity (v0y) is v0 * sin(\u03b8), and the horizontal component of the initial velocity (v0x) is v0 * cos(\u03b8). Since \u03b8 = 45 degrees, we can calculate these components as follows:\nv0y = v0 * sin(45\u00b0) = 30 m/s * sin(45\u00b0) = 30 m/s * 0.7071 = 21.213 m/s\nv0x = v0 * cos(45\u00b0) = 30 m/s * cos(45\u00b0) = 30 m/s * 0.7071 = 21.213 m/s\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time of flight.\nThe time of flight (t) is twice the time it takes for the projectile to reach its maximum height. We can find the time to reach the maximum height using the equation v = v0y - gt. At the maximum height, the vertical velocity is zero.\n0 = v0y - gt\ngt = v0y\nt = v0y / g\nt = 21.213 m/s / 9.8 m/s^2 = 2.16 s\n\nSince the time of flight is twice this value, the total time of flight is:\nt = 2 * 2.16 s = 4.32 s\n\nStep 4: Calculate the maximum height.\nThe maximum height (h) is given by the equation h = (v0y^2) / (2g).\nh = (21.213 m/s)^2 / (2 * 9.8 m/s^2)\nh = 449.41 m^2/s^2 / 19.6 m/s^2\nh = 22.93 m\n\nStep 5: Calculate the horizontal range.\nThe horizontal range (R) is given by the equation R = v0x * t.\nR = 21.213 m/s * 4.32 s\nR = 91.78 m\n\nFinal Answer: The final answers are:\nMaximum height: 22.93 m\nTotal time of flight: 4.32 s\nHorizontal range: 91.78 m",
            "Step 1: Identify the given parameters and the quantities to be calculated.\n- Initial velocity (v0) = 30 m/s\n- Angle of projection (\u03b8) = 45 degrees\n- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.8 m/s^2\n- We need to calculate the maximum height (h), the total time of flight (t), and the horizontal range (R).\n\nStep 2: Resolve the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components.\n- The horizontal component of the initial velocity (v0x) is given by v0x = v0 * cos(\u03b8) = 30 m/s * cos(45 degrees) = 30 m/s * 0.7071 = 21.213 m/s\n- The vertical component of the initial velocity (v0y) is given by v0y = v0 * sin(\u03b8) = 30 m/s * sin(45 degrees) = 30 m/s * 0.7071 = 21.213 m/s\n\nStep 3: Calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile.\n- The maximum height (h) is given by h = (v0y^2) / (2 * g) = (21.213 m/s)^2 / (2 * 9.8 m/s^2) = 450.375 m^2 / 19.6 m/s^2 = 22.975 m\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total time of flight.\n- The time of flight (t) can be calculated using the equation t = 2 * v0y / g = 2 * 21.213 m/s / 9.8 m/s^2 = 43.426 m/s / 9.8 m/s^2 = 4.435 s\n\nStep 5: Calculate the horizontal range of the projectile.\n- The horizontal range (R) is given by R = v0x * t = 21.213 m/s * 4.435 s = 94.113 m^2 / s = 94.113 m\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum height reached by the projectile is 22.975 m, the total time of flight is 4.435 s, and the horizontal range of the projectile is 94.113 m.",
            "Step 1: Identify the given information and the quantities to be calculated.\nThe initial velocity of the projectile is given as 30 m/s, and the angle of projection is 45 degrees. We need to calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile, the total time of flight, and the horizontal range of the projectile.\n\nStep 2: Resolve the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components.\nThe horizontal component of the initial velocity is given by v0x = v0cos(\u03b8), where v0 is the initial velocity and \u03b8 is the angle of projection. The vertical component of the initial velocity is given by v0y = v0sin(\u03b8).\n\nv0x = 30cos(45\u00b0) = 30(0.707) = 21.21 m/s\nv0y = 30sin(45\u00b0) = 30(0.707) = 21.21 m/s\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time of flight to reach the maximum height.\nAt the maximum height, the vertical component of the velocity is zero. We can use the equation v = v0 + at to find the time it takes for the projectile to reach the maximum height. Since the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s^2, the time of flight to reach the maximum height is given by:\n\nt = v0y / g\n= 21.21 / (-9.8)\n= -2.17 s\n\nHowever, since time cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the time, which is 2.17 s.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile.\nWe can use the equation s = v0y*t + (1/2)*g*t^2 to find the maximum height reached by the projectile. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\ns = 21.21(2.17) + (1/2)(-9.8)(2.17)^2\n= 46.01 - 24.41\n= 21.6 m\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total time of flight.\nThe total time of flight is twice the time it takes for the projectile to reach the maximum height, since the projectile takes the same amount of time to fall back to the ground. Therefore, the total time of flight is:\n\nT = 2(2.17)\n= 4.34 s\n\nStep 6: Calculate the horizontal range of the projectile.\nThe horizontal range of the projectile is given by R = v0x*T. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nR = 21.21(4.34)\n= 92.1 m\n\nFinal Answer: Maximum height reached by the projectile = 21.6 m, Total time of flight = 4.34 s, Horizontal range of the projectile = 92.1 m",
            "Step 1: First, let's identify the given parameters and the parameters we need to find. The projectile is launched with an initial velocity (v0) of 30 m/s at an angle of 45 degrees from the horizontal. We need to find the maximum height (h_max) reached by the projectile, the total time of flight (t_flight), and the horizontal range (R).\n\nStep 2: To find the maximum height, we need to use the equation for the vertical component of the projectile's motion: h = v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t^2, where v0y is the initial vertical velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time. Since the projectile is launched at an angle of 45 degrees, the initial vertical velocity (v0y) is v0*sin(45 degrees) = 30*sin(45 degrees) = 21.21 m/s.\n\nStep 3: To find the maximum height, we need to find the time at which the vertical velocity is zero. We can use the equation v = v0y - g*t to find the time: 0 = 21.21 - 9.8*t. Solving for t, we get t = 21.21/9.8 = 2.17 seconds.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have the time, we can find the maximum height using the equation from Step 2: h_max = v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t^2 = 21.21*2.17 - (1/2)*9.8*(2.17)^2 = 46.03 m.\n\nStep 5: To find the total time of flight, we need to find the time at which the projectile hits the ground. We can use the equation h = v0y*t - (1/2)*g*t^2, where h is the height at which the projectile hits the ground (0 m). Solving for t, we get 0 = 21.21*t - (1/2)*9.8*t^2. This is a quadratic equation, and solving it, we get two solutions: t = 0 and t = 4.38 seconds. The total time of flight is the difference between these two times: t_flight = 4.38 - 0 = 4.38 seconds.\n\nStep 6: To find the horizontal range, we can use the equation R = v0x*t_flight, where v0x is the initial horizontal velocity (v0*cos(45 degrees)) and t_flight is the total time of flight. We already found v0x = 30*cos(45 degrees) = 21.21 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get R = 21.21*4.38 = 93.04 m.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum height reached by the projectile is 46.03 m, the total time of flight is 4.38 seconds, and the horizontal range of the projectile is 93.04 m."
