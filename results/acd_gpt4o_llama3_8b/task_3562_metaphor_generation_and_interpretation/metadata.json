They can provide detailed explanations of metaphors by leveraging their training data, which includes a wide range of literary and non-literary texts.\n3. **Scoring Method:** The `eval_with_llm_judge` function evaluates the LLM's response based on predefined criteria. While this approach generally works, it might have some limitations in perfectly capturing creativity and nuanced interpretation. However, for the given task and criteria, it's a reasonable method for automated scoring.\n\n**Task Implementation Check:**\n- The task instructions are clear and well-structured.\n- The scoring method is defined to check for originality, relevance, and detailed explanation.\n- No serious issues are apparent in the implementation that would affect evaluation.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the current capabilities of LLMs in generating and interpreting metaphors, it is expected that an LLM would succeed at this task.
