            "Step-by-Step Solution:\nFirst, we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can start by moving all the terms involving x to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side.\n\nGiven equation: 2x^2 - 3x + 5 = x^2 - 7 + 4x\n\nSubtract x^2 from both sides of the equation to get:\n2x^2 - x^2 - 3x + 5 = x^2 - x^2 - 7 + 4x\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx^2 - 3x + 5 = -7 + 4x\n\nAdd 3x to both sides of the equation to get:\nx^2 + 5 = -7 + 4x + 3x\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx^2 + 5 = -7 + 7x\n\nAdd 7 to both sides of the equation to get:\nx^2 + 12 = 7x\n\nSubtract 7x from both sides of the equation to get:\nx^2 - 7x + 12 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -7, and c = 12.\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlug in the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula:\nx = (7 \u00b1 \u221a((-7)^2 - 4(1)(12))) / 2(1)\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx = (7 \u00b1 \u221a(49 - 48)) / 2\nx = (7 \u00b1 \u221a1) / 2\nx = (7 \u00b1 1) / 2\n\nThere are two possible solutions for x:\nx = (7 + 1) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4\nx = (7 - 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3\n\nHowever, we need to verify if these solutions are valid by plugging them back into the original equation.\n\nLet's plug x = 4 into the original equation:\n2(4)^2 - 3(4) + 5 = (4)^2 - 7 + 4(4)\n32 - 12 + 5 = 16 - 7 + 16\n25 = 25\n\nThis solution is valid.\n\nLet's plug x = 3 into the original equation:\n2(3)^2 - 3(3) + 5 = (3)^2 - 7 + 4(3)\n18 - 9 + 5 = 9 - 7 + 12\n14 = 14\n\nThis solution is also valid.\n\nHowever, upon re-examining the steps, we notice that we made an error in the quadratic formula. Let's correct that step.\n\nGiven equation: x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0\n\nThe correct quadratic formula is:\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nPlug in the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula:\nx = (7 \u00b1 \u221a((-7)^2 - 4(1)(12))) / 2(1)\n\nThis simplifies to:\nx = (7 \u00b1 \u221a(49 - 48)) / 2\nx = (7 \u00b1 \u221a1) / 2\nx = (7 \u00b1 1) / 2\n\nHowever, we should have factored the quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula. Let's factor the quadratic equation:\nx^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\nx - 3 = 0 or x - 4 = 0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 3 or x = 4\n\nBoth solutions are valid.\n\nFinal Answer:\n3, 4",

They can perform relatively well on structured mathematical problems, provided the problems are within a scope that the model has been trained on.\n\n2. **Instructions and Clarity**: The task requires the model to provide a step-by-step solution and a final answer. LLMs are generally good at following explicit instructions, especially when it comes to generating structured text.\n\n3. **Automatic Scoring**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the responses based on criteria such as including a step-by-step solution, correctness of the final answer, and logical coherence of the solution steps. Assuming the LLM judge is sufficiently reliable in evaluating these criteria, the automatic scoring mechanism should work well for this task.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty Level**: The problems described are of moderate difficulty, which suggests that they are within the grasp of advanced LLMs, especially if the problems are not overly complex or beyond the scope of typical high school mathematics.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent in solving the given arithmetic problem is not surprising. LLMs have been shown to handle such tasks competently, especially when the instructions are clear and the problems are within their training data's scope.\n\n**Decision: No**"
