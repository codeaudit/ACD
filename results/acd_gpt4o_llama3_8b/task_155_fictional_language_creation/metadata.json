            "**Grammar Rules:**\n\n1. **Word Order:** In the fictional language, 'Nuvolish', the basic word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). However, for emphasis or to show possession, the word order can be changed to Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) or Subject-Verb-Adjective (SVA).\n\n   Example: \n   - 'The dog is happy.' (SVO) - 'Kal ina hapo.' \n   - 'The happy dog.' (SVA) - 'Hapo Kal.'\n   - 'The dog is happy and the cat is sad.' (SOV) - 'Kal hapo, Kek sado.'\n\n2. **Verb Conjugation:** Verbs in Nuvolish are conjugated based on the subject, tense, and mood. There are three tenses: present, past, and future. The verb 'to be' has seven moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, conditional, potential, and prohibitive.\n\n   Example: \n   - Present tense, indicative mood: 'I am happy.' - 'Ina hapo.'\n   - Past tense, indicative mood: 'I was happy.' - 'Ina hapo zip.'\n   - Future tense, indicative mood: 'I will be happy.' - 'Ina hapo zin.'\n   - Imperative mood: 'Be happy!' - 'Hapo ina!'\n   - Subjunctive mood: 'It is possible that I am happy.' - 'Ina hapo zek.'\n\n3. **Noun-Adjective Agreement:** Adjectives in Nuvolish agree with the nouns they modify in number, case, and gender.\n\n   Example: \n   - 'The happy dog.' - 'Hapo Kal.' (The adjective 'hapo' agrees with the noun 'Kal' in number and case.)\n   - 'The happy dogs.' - 'Hapo Kali.' (The adjective 'hapo' agrees with the noun 'Kali' in number and case.)\n\n4. **Case System:** Nuvolish has a simple case system with three cases: nominative, accusative, and genitive.\n\n   Example: \n   - Nominative case: 'I am happy.' - 'Ina hapo.'\n   - Accusative case: 'I am happy and the cat is sad.' - 'Kal hapo, Kek sado.'\n   - Genitive case: 'The dog's happiness.' - 'Kal hapo zi.'\n\n5. **Pronouns:** Nuvolish has a set of pronouns that replace nouns in a sentence.\n\n   Example: \n   - 'I am happy.' - 'Ina hapo.' (The pronoun 'ina' replaces the noun 'I'.)\n   - 'You are happy.' - 'Uma hapo.' (The pronoun 'uma' replaces the noun 'you'.)\n\n**Translation:**\n\n'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'\n\nIn Nuvolish, the translation would be:\n\n'Keki siro kupu Kal zi, Kalu siro kupu Kek.'\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- 'Keki': The quick (adjective 'keki' agrees with the noun 'fox' in number and case)\n- 'siro': Brown (adjective 'siro' agrees with the noun 'fox' in number and case)\n- 'kupu': Fox (noun 'kupu' in the nominative case)\n- 'Kal zi': The lazy dog (the noun 'Kal' is in the genitive case, indicating possession)\n- 'Kalu': The (adjective 'kalu' agrees with the noun 'dog' in number and case)\n- 'siro': Brown (adjective 'siro' agrees with the noun 'dog' in number and case)\n- 'kupu': Dog (noun 'kupu' in the accusative case)\n- 'Kek': The lazy (adjective 'kek' agrees with the noun 'dog' in number and case)\n\nNote: The verb 'jumps' is translated to 'zi pu' in Nuvolish, where 'zi' is the verb 'to jump' and 'pu' is the particle indicating the direction of the action.",

            "Grammar Rules:\nIn the fictional language, which we'll call \"Nuvolish,\" the basic grammar rules are as follows:\n\n1. **Word Order:** Nuvolish follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order. Example: \"I go store\" (subject: I, verb: go, object: store).\n2. **Verb Conjugation:** Verbs are conjugated based on the subject's grammatical aspect (e.g., present, past, future). The present tense is formed by adding a suffix to the root of the verb. The past tense is formed by changing the root of the verb. Future tense is formed by adding a prefix. Example:\n\t* Present tense: \"I go\" ( root: go + suffix: -a = ga)\n\t* Past tense: \"I went\" (root: go + changed root: goh + suffix: -a = goha)\n\t* Future tense: \"I will go\" (prefix: zi- + root: go + suffix: -a = zigoha)\n3. **Noun-Adjective Agreement:** Adjectives agree with the noun they modify in both number and case. Plural nouns take the plural form of the adjective. Example:\n\t* Singular noun: \"big dog\" (adjective: big, noun: dog)\n\t* Plural noun: \"big dogs\" (adjective: big + plural suffix: -i, noun: dogi)\n\nTranslation:\nTo translate the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" we'll follow the grammar rules above:\n\n1. Identify the subject, verb, and object:\n\t* Subject: fox\n\t* Verb: jump\n\t* Object: over dog\n2. Apply the SVO word order:\n\t* Subject: fox\n\t* Verb: jump\n\t* Object: over dog\n3. Conjugate the verb \"jump\" in the present tense:\n\t* Add the present tense suffix -a to the root of the verb: jump + -a = jumpa\n4. Apply noun-adjective agreement:\n\t* The adjective \"quick\" modifies the noun \"fox,\" so it remains the same.\n\t* The adjective \"brown\" modifies the noun \"fox,\" so it remains the same.\n\t* The adjective \"lazy\" modifies the noun \"dog,\" so it remains the same.\n5.

            "Grammar Rules:\n\n**Word Order:**\nIn our fictional language, called \"Nuvolish\", the basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). However, we have a specific rule for when the object is a direct object: if the direct object is a noun, it will come after the verb. If the direct object is a pronoun, it will come after the subject.\n\nExample:\n\n* Nuvolish: Ka leko lepa ni (Koko eats fruit the). In this example, the direct object is \"fruit\" (lepa), so it comes after the verb \"ni\".\n* Nuvolish: Koko piko (Koko gives it). In this example, the direct object is the pronoun \"it\" (piko), so it comes after the subject \"Koko\".\n\n**Verb Conjugation:**\nNuvolish verbs change depending on the tense, mood, and subject agreement. There are three main tenses: present, past, and future.\n\n* Present tense: Add the suffix \"-ni\" to the base form of the verb.\n* Past tense: Add the suffix \"-pe\" to the base form of the verb.\n* Future tense: Add the suffix \"-mo\" to the base form of the verb.\n\nExample:\n\n* Present tense: Koko ni piko (Koko gives).\n* Past tense: Koko pe piko (Koko gave).\n* Future tense: Koko mo piko (Koko will give).\n\n**Noun-Adjective Agreement:**\nIn Nuvolish, nouns and adjectives must agree in case and number.\n\n* Case: The noun and adjective must have the same case (nominative or accusative).\n* Number: The noun and adjective must have the same number (singular or plural).\n\nExample:\n\n* Nuvolish: Ka leko lepa ni (Koko eats fruit the). In this example, the noun \"lepa\" (fruit) is singular, so the adjective \"leko\" (the fruit) is also singular.\n* Nuvolish: Ka leko lepe ni (Koko eats fruits the). In this example, the noun \"lepe\" (fruits) is plural, so the adjective \"leko\" (the fruits) is also plural.\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe sentence \"She sells seashells by the seashore\" can be translated into Nuvolish as follows:\n\nNuvolish: Koka pe leki mo pe loki loka loki (Koka sells shells by the seashore).\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Koka: She (nominative case, feminine)\n* pe: sells (past tense)\n* leki: seashells (direct object, accusative case)\n* mo: by (preposition)\n* pe: the (adjective, accusative case)\n* loki: seashore (direct object, accusative case)\n* loki: seashore (noun, nominative case)\n\nNote that the verb \"pe\" (sells) is in the past tense, and the adjective \"pe\" (the) is in the accusative case to agree with the direct object \"leki\" (seashells).",

            "Grammar Rules:\n\n1. Word Order: In the language of Zha'thik, the typical word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This means that the subject of the sentence comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb.\n\nExample: \n- \"Ta ki pu\" means \"The cat eats food.\" (Here, \"Ta\" is the subject, \"ki\" is the object, and \"pu\" is the verb.)\n\n2. Verb Conjugation: Verbs in Zha'thik change depending on the tense and the subject's gender. There are three tenses: past, present, and future. For simplicity, we'll focus on the present tense. Verbs change depending on the subject's gender:\n- For male subjects, verbs end in \"-a\".\n- For female subjects, verbs end in \"-i\".\n- For neutral subjects, verbs end in \"-e\".\n\nExample: \n- \"Ta\" (male cat) eats \"ki\" (food): \"Ta kia\" (He eats food.)\n- \"Ni\" (female cat) eats \"ki\" (food): \"Ni ki\" (She eats food.)\n- \"Ze\" (neutral cat) eats \"ki\" (food): \"Ze ke\" (It eats food.)\n\n3. Noun-Adjective Agreement: Adjectives in Zha'thik agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender. \n- For male subjects, adjectives end in \"-a\".\n- For female subjects, adjectives end in \"-i\".\n- For neutral subjects, adjectives end in \"-e\".\n\nExample: \n- \"Ta\" (male cat) is big: \"Ta laa\" (He is big.)\n- \"Ni\" (female cat) is big: \"Ni li\" (She is big.)\n- \"Ze\" (neutral cat) is big: \"Ze le\" (It is big.)\n\n4. Compound Words: In Zha'thik, compound words are formed by combining two or more words together. This is done by placing the first word in its original form and then modifying the subsequent word with a suffix that indicates its function:\n- \"-to\" indicates a location.\n- \"-ra\" indicates an action or an event.\n\nExample: \n- \"Kia-to\" means \"food-place\" or \"restaurant.\"\n- \"Kia-ra\" means \"to eat\" or \"to consume food.\"\n\nTranslation: \n\"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n\nIn Zha'thik, this sentence would be translated as \"Ni kii sha-she ke sha-to.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Ni\" is the female subject (she).\n- \"kii\" is the verb \"sells\", conjugated in the present tense with a female subject and ending in \"-i\".\n- \"sha-she\" is the compound word for \"seashells\", where \"sha\" indicates a type of object and \"she\" is the actual object (seashells).\n- \"ke\" is the verb \"by the\" in the present tense for a neutral subject, indicating location.\n- \"sha-to\" is the compound word for \"seashore\", where \"sha\" indicates a location and \"to\" indicates a place.\n\nSo, the complete translation is: \"Ni kii sha-she ke sha-to.\"",
            "Grammar Rules: \n\n1. **Word Order:** In the fictional language, also known as 'Nuvolish', the basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is similar to languages like Japanese and Korean.\n\nExample: \n- \"The dog (subject) bites (verb) the cat (object)\" would be translated to Nuvolish as \"Koti (dog) mora (cat) kuzu (bites)\".\n\n2. **Verb Conjugation:** In Nuvolish, verb conjugation depends on the subject's person (first, second, third) and tense (present, past, future). Here's a simplified conjugation table:\n\n| Tense | First Person | Second Person | Third Person |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Present | -a | -i | -u |\n| Past | -e | -i | -u |\n| Future | -ka | -i | -u |\n\nExample:\n- The verb \"kuzu\" (to bite) in the present tense would be conjugated as follows:\n  - First person: kazua (I bite)\n  - Second person: kuzui (You bite)\n  - Third person: kuzu (He/She/It bites)\n\n3. **Noun-Adjective Agreement:** In Nuvolish, adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in both number (singular or plural) and case (nominative or accusative).\n\nExample:\n- The adjective \"kori\" (big) would be declined as follows:\n  - Singular nominative: kor\n  - Singular accusative: kore\n  - Plural nominative: koru\n  - Plural accusative: kore\n\n4. **Nouns:** Nuvolish nouns have a complex case system with nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative cases.\n\nExample:\n- The noun \"koti\" (dog) would be declined as follows:\n  - Nominative: koti\n  - Accusative: kote\n  - Genitive: kotina\n  - Dative: kotei\n\n5. **Pronouns:** Nuvolish has a set of personal pronouns that replace nouns in sentences.\n\nExample:\n- The first-person singular pronoun is \"moro\" (I), the second-person singular pronoun is \"mori\" (You), and the third-person singular pronoun is \"moro\" (He/She/It).\n\nTranslation:\nTo translate the sentence \"She sells seashells by the seashore\" into Nuvolish, let's break it down:\n\n1. \"She\" translates to \"moro\" in Nuvolish (third-person singular pronoun).\n2. \"sells\" translates to \"kuzu\" in Nuvolish (verb to sell).\n3. \"seashells\" translates to \"koreki\" in Nuvolish (noun for seashells).\n4. \"by the seashore\" translates to \"korei mori kore\" in Nuvolish (noun for seashore and preposition).\n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\"Moro kuzu koreki korei mori kore.\"\n\nThis translates to \"She sells seashells by the seashore\" in Nuvolish."

            "**Grammar Rules:**\n\n1. **Word Order:** In the fictional language, 'Nuvolish', the basic word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). However, for emphasis or to show possession, the word order can be changed to Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) or Subject-Verb-Adjective (SVA).\n\n   Example: \n   - 'The dog is happy.' (SVO) - 'Kal ina hapo.' \n   - 'The happy dog.' (SVA) - 'Hapo Kal.'\n   - 'The dog is happy and the cat is sad.' (SOV) - 'Kal hapo, Kek sado.'\n\n2. **Verb Conjugation:** Verbs in Nuvolish are conjugated based on the subject, tense, and mood. There are three tenses: present, past, and future. The verb 'to be' has seven moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, conditional, potential, and prohibitive.\n\n   Example: \n   - Present tense, indicative mood: 'I am happy.' - 'Ina hapo.'\n   - Past tense, indicative mood: 'I was happy.' - 'Ina hapo zip.'\n   - Future tense, indicative mood: 'I will be happy.' - 'Ina hapo zin.'\n   - Imperative mood: 'Be happy!' - 'Hapo ina!'\n   - Subjunctive mood: 'It is possible that I am happy.' - 'Ina hapo zek.'\n\n3. **Noun-Adjective Agreement:** Adjectives in Nuvolish agree with the nouns they modify in number, case, and gender.\n\n   Example: \n   - 'The happy dog.' - 'Hapo Kal.'

Example: \"I go store\" (subject: I, verb: go, object: store).\n2. **Verb Conjugation:** Verbs are conjugated based on the subject's grammatical aspect (e.g., present, past, future). The present tense is formed by adding a suffix to the root of the verb. The past tense is formed by changing the root of the verb. Future tense is formed by adding a prefix. Example:\n\t* Present tense: \"I go\" ( root: go + suffix: -a = ga)\n\t* Past tense: \"I went\" (root: go + changed root: goh + suffix: -a = goha)\n\t* Future tense: \"I will go\" (prefix: zi- + root: go + suffix: -a = zigoha)\n3. **Noun-Adjective Agreement:** Adjectives agree with the noun they modify in both number and case.

Verb Conjugation:\n   - Verbs in the language change form depending on the subject.\n   - First person singular: -a (e.g., \"I eat\" becomes \"I-a\")\n   - Second person singular: -i (e.g., \"you eat\" becomes \"you-i\")\n   - Third person singular: -e (e.g., \"he/she/it eats\" becomes \"he/she/it-e\")\n   - First person plural: -\u00e4m (e.g., \"we eat\" becomes \"we-\u00e4m\")\n   - Second person plural: -im (e.g., \"you all eat\" becomes \"you all-im\")\n   - Third person plural: -en (e.g., \"they eat\" becomes \"they-en\")\n\n   Example: \"I (first person singular) eat (eat-a) apple\", \"you (second person singular) eat (eat-i) apple\", \"he (third person singular) eat (eat-e) apple\".\n\n3. Noun-Adjective Agreement:\n   - Adjectives agree with the noun in case and number.\n   - In nominative case, adjectives are -a (e.g., \"the big house\" becomes \"big-a house\")\n   - In accusative case, adjectives are -e (e.g., \"the big dog\" becomes \"big-e dog\")\n   - In genitive case, adjectives are -o (e.g., \"the big house's owner\" becomes \"big-o house\")\n\n   Example: \"the big (adjective) house (nominative case)\" becomes \"big-a house\", \"the big (adjective) dog (accusative case)\" becomes \"big-e dog\", \"the big (adjective) house's (genitive case)\" becomes \"big-o house\".\n\n4. Plural Nouns:\n   - Plural nouns in the language are marked with an -n (e.g., \"apple\" becomes \"apple-n\")\n\n   Example: \"one apple\" becomes \"apple\", \"many apples\" becomes \"apple-n\".\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\nThe translation in the fictional language is:\n\nT\u00e4kh\u00e4 (quick-nominative) vulsizi (brown-nominative) fox (nominative) q\u00e4p\u00e4 (jump-a) \u00f6ver (over) laz\u00e4 (lazy-nominative) k\u00e4l\u00e4 (dog-nominative).\n\nThis follows the SOV word order, with the subject \"fox\" coming first, followed by the object \"over\" which is in the accusative case, then the verb \"q\u00e4p\u00e4\", and finally the object \"k\u00e4l\u00e4\" in the nominative case. The adjective \"quick\" is translated as \"t\u00e4kh\u00e4\" and agrees with \"fox\" in the nominative case, while the adjective \"brown\" is translated as \"vulsizi\" and agrees with \"fox\" in the nominative case. The adjective \"lazy\" is translated as \"laz\u00e4\" and agrees with \"k\u00e4l\u00e4\" in the nominative case."

            "Grammar Rules:\n\n**Word Order:**\nIn our fictional language, called \"Nuvolish\", the basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). However, we have a specific rule for when the object is a direct object: if the direct object is a noun, it will come after the verb. If the direct object is a pronoun, it will come after the subject.\n\nExample:\n\n* Nuvolish: Ka leko lepa ni (Koko eats fruit the). In this example, the direct object is \"fruit\" (lepa), so it comes after the verb \"ni\".\n* Nuvolish: Koko piko (Koko gives it). In this example, the direct object is the pronoun \"it\" (piko), so it comes after the subject \"Koko\".\n\n**Verb Conjugation:**\nNuvolish verbs change depending on the tense, mood, and subject agreement. There are three main tenses: present, past, and future.\n\n* Present tense: Add the suffix \"-ni\" to the base form of the verb.\n* Past tense: Add the suffix \"-pe\" to the base form of the verb.\n* Future tense: Add the suffix \"-mo\" to the base form of the verb.\n\nExample:\n\n* Present tense: Koko ni piko (Koko gives).\n* Past tense: Koko pe piko (Koko gave).\n* Future tense: Koko mo piko (Koko will give).\n\n**Noun-Adjective Agreement:**\nIn Nuvolish, nouns and adjectives must agree in case and number.\n\n* Case: The noun and adjective must have the same case (nominative or accusative).\n* Number: The noun and adjective must have the same number (singular or plural).\n\nExample:\n\n* Nuvolish: Ka leko lepa ni (Koko eats fruit the). In this example, the noun \"lepa\" (fruit) is singular, so the adjective \"leko\" (the fruit) is also singular.\n* Nuvolish: Ka leko lepe ni (Koko eats fruits the). In this example, the noun \"lepe\" (fruits) is plural, so the adjective \"leko\" (the fruits) is also plural.\n\nTranslation:\n\nThe sentence \"She sells seashells by the seashore\" can be translated into Nuvolish as follows:\n\nNuvolish: Koka pe leki mo pe loki loka loki (Koka sells shells by the seashore).\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Koka: She (nominative case, feminine)\n* pe: sells (past tense)\n* leki: seashells (direct object, accusative case)\n* mo: by (preposition)\n* pe: the (adjective, accusative case)\n* loki: seashore (direct object, accusative case)\n* loki: seashore (noun, nominative case)\n\nNote that the verb \"pe\" (sells) is in the past tense, and the adjective \"pe\" (the) is in the accusative case to agree with the direct object \"leki\" (seashells).",
            "Grammar Rules:\n\n**Word Order:**\nIn the fictional language, called \"Nuvolish,\" the basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). However, for emphasis or to convey a specific tone, the word order can be modified to Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) or even Object-Subject-Verb (OSV).\n\nExamples:\n\n* Basic word order: \"I eat apple\" (Nuvolish: \"Meli kalvu\" - Meli: I, kalvu: eat, apple: object)\n* Emphatic word order: \"I eat apple\" (SVO) - \"Meli kalvu meli\" (emphasizing \"I\")\n* Object-subject-verb word order: \"Apple I eat\" (OSV) - \"Kalvu meli meli\" (emphasizing \"apple\")\n\n**Verb Conjugation:**\nIn Nuvolish, verbs are conjugated based on the subject's grammatical person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or plural).\n\nExamples:\n\n* Present tense:\n\t+ First person singular: -i (e.g., \"I eat\" - \"Meli kalvi\")\n\t+ Second person singular: -a (e.g., \"You eat\" - \"Tela kalva\")\n\t+ Third person singular: -e (e.g., \"He/She eats\" - \"Elo kalve\")\n\t+ First person plural: -imi (e.g., \"We eat\" - \"Meli kalvimi\")\n\t+ Second person plural: -ami (e.g., \"You (plural) eat\" - \"Tela kalvami\")\n\t+ Third person plural: -ene (e.g., \"They eat\" - \"Elo kalvene\")\n* Past tense:\n\t+ First person singular: -ivi (e.g., \"I ate\" - \"Meli kalvivi\")\n\t+ Second person singular: -ava (e.g., \"You ate\" - \"Tela kalvava\")\n\t+ Third person singular: -eva (e.g., \"He/She ate\" - \"Elo kalveva\")\n\t+ First person plural: -ivimi (e.g., \"We ate\" - \"Meli kalvivimi\")\n\t+ Second person plural: -avami (e.g., \"You (plural) ate\" - \"Tela kalvavami\")\n\t+ Third person plural: -evene (e.g., \"They ate\" - \"Elo kalvevane\")\n\n**Noun-Adjective Agreement:**\nIn Nuvolish, nouns agree with their adjectives in number and case.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Singular noun with singular adjective: \"big house\" (Nuvolish: \"moro kalvu\" - moro: big, kalvu: house)\n* Plural noun with plural adjective: \"big houses\" (Nuvolish: \"morovi kalvumi\" - morovi: big, kalvumi: houses)\n* Singular noun with plural adjective (emphasis on the noun): \"house many\" (Nuvolish: \"kalvu moro\" - kalvu: house, moro: many)\n\nTranslation:\n\n\"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n\nIn Nuvolish, the translation would be:\n\n\"Meli kalvu sela kalvu salelo kalvu.\"\n\nBreakdown:\n\n* \"Meli\" - She (first person singular pronoun)\n* \"kalvu\" - sells (verb, present tense, third person singular)\n* \"sela\" - seashells (noun, object)\n* \"kalvu\" - by (preposition)\n* \"salelo\" - seashore (noun, object)\n* \"kalvu\" - the (article, agreeing with \"salelo\")\n\nNote: In Nuvolish, the verb \"kalvu\" (sells) is conjugated in the third person singular form to agree with the subject \"Meli\" (she). The preposition \"kalvu\" (by) is used to indicate the location where the seashells are sold. The article \"kalvu\" (the) is used to modify the noun \"salelo\" (seashore).",
            "Grammar Rules:\n\n**Word Order:**\nIn the fictional language, called \"Nuvolish,\" the typical word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This means that the subject of the sentence comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb.\n\nExample: \"I eat apple.\" (Nuvolish: \"Nuvola koro vora.\")\n\n* \"Nuvola\" is the subject (I).\n* \"Koro\" is the object (apple).\n* \"Vora\" is the verb (eat).\n\n**Verb Conjugation:**\nNuvolish verbs change depending on the tense and the subject. There are three tenses: present, past, and future. The verb conjugation also changes depending on the subject's person and number.\n\nExample:\n* Present tense:\n\t+ First person singular (I): \"-a\"\n\t+ Second person singular (you): \"-e\"\n\t+ Third person singular (he/she/it): \"-i\"\n\t+ First person plural (we): \"-ima\"\n\t+ Second person plural (you): \"-eme\"\n\t+ Third person plural (they): \"-ine\"\n* Past tense:\n\t+ First person singular: \"-ava\"\n\t+ Second person singular: \"-eva\"\n\t+ Third person singular: \"-iva\"\n\t+ First person plural: \"-imava\"\n\t+ Second person plural: \"-emeva\"\n\t+ Third person plural: \"-iniva\"\n* Future tense:\n\t+ First person singular: \"-aka\"\n\t+ Second person singular: \"-eka\"\n\t+ Third person singular: \"-ika\"\n\t+ First person plural: \"-imaka\"\n\t+ Second person plural: \"-emeka\"\n\t+ Third person plural: \"-inika\"\n\nExample: \"I eat apple.\" (Present tense): \"Nuvola koro vora-a.\"\n\"I ate apple.\" (Past tense): \"Nuvola koro vora-ava.\"\n\"I will eat apple.\" (Future tense): \"Nuvola koro vora-aka.\"\n\n**Noun-Adjective Agreement:**\nIn Nuvolish, adjectives agree with the noun they modify in number and case. There are two cases: nominative and accusative.\n\nExample:\n* Nominative case (subject):\n\t+ Singular: \"-o\"\n\t+ Plural: \"-e\"\n* Accusative case (object):\n\t+ Singular: \"-a\"\n\t+ Plural: \"-e\"\n\nExample: \"The big apple.\" (Nominative case): \"Koro vora-o.\"\n\"The big apples.\" (Nominative case): \"Koro vora-e.\"\n\"The apple is big.\" (Accusative case): \"Koro vora-a.\"\n\nTranslation:\n\n\"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n\nIn Nuvolish, the translation would be: \"Nuvola koro-sa vora-i kele-ni koro-sa.\"\n\nBreakdown:\n\n* \"Nuvola\" is the subject (she).\n* \"Koro-sa\" is the object (seashells) in the accusative case.\n* \"Vora-i\" is the verb (sells) in the present tense, third person singular.\n* \"Kele-ni\" is the preposition \"by\" in the accusative case.\n* \"Koro-sa\" is the object (seashore) in the accusative case.\n\nAnswer: Nuvola koro-sa vora-i kele-ni koro-sa.",
            "Grammar Rules:\n\n1. Word Order: In the language of Zha'thik, the typical word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This means that the subject of the sentence comes first, followed by the object, and then the verb.\n\nExample: \n- \"Ta ki pu\" means \"The cat eats food.\" (Here, \"Ta\" is the subject, \"ki\" is the object, and \"pu\" is the verb.)\n\n2. Verb Conjugation: Verbs in Zha'thik change depending on the tense and the subject's gender. There are three tenses: past, present, and future. For simplicity, we'll focus on the present tense. Verbs change depending on the subject's gender:\n- For male subjects, verbs end in \"-a\".\n- For female subjects, verbs end in \"-i\".\n- For neutral subjects, verbs end in \"-e\".\n\nExample: \n- \"Ta\" (male cat) eats \"ki\" (food): \"Ta kia\" (He eats food.)\n- \"Ni\" (female cat) eats \"ki\" (food): \"Ni ki\" (She eats food.)\n- \"Ze\" (neutral cat) eats \"ki\" (food): \"Ze ke\" (It eats food.)\n\n3. Noun-Adjective Agreement: Adjectives in Zha'thik agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender. \n- For male subjects, adjectives end in \"-a\".\n- For female subjects, adjectives end in \"-i\".\n- For neutral subjects, adjectives end in \"-e\".\n\nExample: \n- \"Ta\" (male cat) is big: \"Ta laa\" (He is big.)\n- \"Ni\" (female cat) is big: \"Ni li\" (She is big.)\n- \"Ze\" (neutral cat) is big: \"Ze le\" (It is big.)\n\n4. Compound Words: In Zha'thik, compound words are formed by combining two or more words together. This is done by placing the first word in its original form and then modifying the subsequent word with a suffix that indicates its function:\n- \"-to\" indicates a location.\n- \"-ra\" indicates an action or an event.\n\nExample: \n- \"Kia-to\" means \"food-place\" or \"restaurant.\"\n- \"Kia-ra\" means \"to eat\" or \"to consume food.\"\n\nTranslation: \n\"She sells seashells by the seashore.\"\n\nIn Zha'thik, this sentence would be translated as \"Ni kii sha-she ke sha-to.\"\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Ni\" is the female subject (she).\n- \"kii\" is the verb \"sells\", conjugated in the present tense with a female subject and ending in \"-i\".\n- \"sha-she\" is the compound word for \"seashells\", where \"sha\" indicates a type of object and \"she\" is the actual object (seashells).\n- \"ke\" is the verb \"by the\" in the present tense for a neutral subject, indicating location.\n- \"sha-to\" is the compound word for \"seashore\", where \"sha\" indicates a location and \"to\" indicates a place.\n\nSo, the complete translation is: \"Ni kii sha-she ke sha-to.\"",
            "Grammar Rules: \n\n1. **Word Order:** In the fictional language, also known as 'Nuvolish', the basic word order is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). This is similar to languages like Japanese and Korean.\n\nExample: \n- \"The dog (subject) bites (verb) the cat (object)\" would be translated to Nuvolish as \"Koti (dog) mora (cat) kuzu (bites)\".\n\n2. **Verb Conjugation:** In Nuvolish, verb conjugation depends on the subject's person (first, second, third) and tense (present, past, future). Here's a simplified conjugation table:\n\n| Tense | First Person | Second Person | Third Person |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Present | -a | -i | -u |\n| Past | -e | -i | -u |\n| Future | -ka | -i | -u |\n\nExample:\n- The verb \"kuzu\" (to bite) in the present tense would be conjugated as follows:\n  - First person: kazua (I bite)\n  - Second person: kuzui (You bite)\n  - Third person: kuzu (He/She/It bites)\n\n3. **Noun-Adjective Agreement:** In Nuvolish, adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in both number (singular or plural) and case (nominative or accusative).\n\nExample:\n- The adjective \"kori\" (big) would be declined as follows:\n  - Singular nominative: kor\n  - Singular accusative: kore\n  - Plural nominative: koru\n  - Plural accusative: kore\n\n4. **Nouns:** Nuvolish nouns have a complex case system with nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative cases.\n\nExample:\n- The noun \"koti\" (dog) would be declined as follows:\n  - Nominative: koti\n  - Accusative: kote\n  - Genitive: kotina\n  - Dative: kotei\n\n5. **Pronouns:** Nuvolish has a set of personal pronouns that replace nouns in sentences.\n\nExample:\n- The first-person singular pronoun is \"moro\" (I), the second-person singular pronoun is \"mori\" (You), and the third-person singular pronoun is \"moro\" (He/She/It).\n\nTranslation:\nTo translate the sentence \"She sells seashells by the seashore\" into Nuvolish, let's break it down:\n\n1. \"She\" translates to \"moro\" in Nuvolish (third-person singular pronoun).\n2. \"sells\" translates to \"kuzu\" in Nuvolish (verb to sell).\n3. \"seashells\" translates to \"koreki\" in Nuvolish (noun for seashells).\n4. \"by the seashore\" translates to \"korei mori kore\" in Nuvolish (noun for seashore and preposition).\n\nPutting it all together, we get: \n\"Moro kuzu koreki korei mori kore.\"\n\nThis translates to \"She sells seashells by the seashore\" in Nuvolish."
