Explanation: To find the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring, we need to create a Punnett square. The Punnett square is a diagram that shows all possible combinations of alleles from the two parents. In this case, the homozygous red flower (RR) is the female parent and the heterozygous red flower (Rr) is the male parent. The Punnett square is as follows:\n\nR | R R\n---------\nr | Rr rr\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see that there is a 25% chance of RR, 50% chance of Rr, and 25% chance of rr. Therefore, the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1. Since RR and Rr both result in red flowers, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1.",
            "To solve this problem, I will use a Punnett square to determine the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring.\n\nThe Punnett square is a diagram that shows the possible combinations of alleles (R and r) from the two parents. The parent with the genotype RR is homozygous for the red allele, while the parent with the genotype Rr is heterozygous for the red and white alleles.\n\nThe Punnett square can be represented as follows:\n\n  R  | R R | R r\n  ---------\nR | RR | Rr\n  r | rR | rr\n\nSince the parent with the genotype Rr can contribute either R or r, the possible genotypes of the offspring are:\n\n1. RR (from RR x R)\n2. Rr (from RR x r and R x R)\n3. rr (from R x r)\n\nThe Punnet square shows that there is a 50% chance of RR, 50% chance of Rr, and 0% chance of rr (since r cannot be contributed by the RR parent).\n\nThe phenotypes of the offspring can be determined as follows:\n\n* RR and Rr will have the red phenotype (since R is dominant over r)\n* rr will have the white phenotype\n\nTherefore, the genotypic ratio of the offspring is 1:1:0 (RR:Rr:rr), but since rr does not actually exist in this scenario, we can ignore it and say the genotypic ratio is 1:1.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio is 2:0 (red:white), but since we are looking for the ratio of red to total offspring, we can say the phenotypic ratio is 2:1.\n\nHowever, since there is no rr genotype, the genotypic ratio is actually 1:1 for RR and Rr, and the phenotypic ratio is 1:0 for red to white is not possible, since there is no white offspring, so we should consider the total number of offspring as 1 (RR) + 1 (Rr) = 2, and the phenotypic ratio is 2:0 is not possible, so we should consider that the ratio of red to total offspring is 2:2.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n1. Genotypic Ratio: 1:1\n2. Phenotypic Ratio: 1:1\n3. Explanation: The Punnett square shows that there is a 50% chance of RR and 50% chance of Rr. The RR and Rr genotypes both result in the red phenotype, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1.",
            "To solve this problem, I will first create a Punnett square to determine the possible genotypes of the offspring.\n\nThe Punnett square is as follows:\n\n```\n  R | r\n---------\nR | RR | Rr\nr | rR | rr\n```\n\nIn this Punnett square, the top row represents the alleles from the homozygous red flower (RR), and the left column represents the alleles from the heterozygous red flower (Rr).\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see that the possible genotypes of the offspring are RR, Rr, and rr.\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypic ratio. Since R is dominant over r, we can predict the phenotype of each genotype as follows:\n\n* RR: Red\n* Rr: Red\n* rr: White\n\nSince RR and Rr both result in the red phenotype, the phenotypic ratio is 2 Red : 1 White.\n\nTherefore, the genotypic ratio is 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr, and the phenotypic ratio is 2 Red : 1 White.\n\nHere is the final answer in the required format:\n\n1. Genotypic Ratio: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr\n2. Phenotypic Ratio: 2 Red : 1 White\n3. Explanation: The Punnett square shows that there is a 25% chance of RR, 50% chance of Rr, and 25% chance of rr. Therefore, the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 and the phenotypic ratio is 2:1 since RR and Rr both result in the red phenotype.",
            "To solve this problem, I will break it down into steps and use a Punnett square to calculate the genotypic and phenotypic ratios.\n\nThe Punnett square is a tool used in genetics to predict the probability of different genotypes in offspring. It is a square table that shows all possible combinations of alleles from two parents.\n\nIn this case, we have a homozygous red flower (RR) and a heterozygous red flower (Rr). We need to find the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of their offspring.\n\nHere's the Punnett square:\n\n```\n  | R | r\n----------------\nR | RR | Rr\n----------------\nr | Rr | rr\n```\n\nThe Punnett square shows that there are three possible genotypes: RR, Rr, and rr. The probabilities of each genotype are as follows:\n\n* RR: 25% (1/4)\n* Rr: 50% (2/4)\n* rr: 25% (1/4)\n\nNow, let's consider the phenotypic ratios. Since red is dominant over white, the RR genotype will express red color, and the rr genotype will express white color. The Rr genotype will also express red color because R is dominant over r.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n* Red: 75% (RR + Rr)\n* White: 25% (rr)\n\nThe genotypic ratio is 1:2:1, and the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (75% red to 25% white).\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n1. Genotypic Ratio: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr\n2. Phenotypic Ratio: 3 Red : 1 White\n3. Explanation: The Punnett square shows that there is a 25% chance of RR, 50% chance of Rr, and 25% chance of rr. Therefore, the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 and the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 since RR and Rr both result in red flowers, and rr results in white flowers.",
            "To solve this problem, I will first construct a Punnett square to show the possible genotypes of the offspring. Since the parents are a homozygous red flower (RR) and a heterozygous red flower (Rr), I will use the following letters to represent the alleles:\n\nR: Red color\nr: White color\n\nThe Punnett square will show the possible genotypes of the offspring by combining the alleles from each parent.\n\n```\n  | R | r\n---------\nR | RR | Rr\nr | rR | rr\n```\n\nFrom the Punnett square, we can see that the possible genotypes of the offspring are:\n\n1. RR (homozygous red)\n2. Rr (heterozygous red)\n3. rr (homozygous white)\n\nTo find the genotypic ratio, we count the number of each genotype in the Punnett square. There is one RR, two Rr, and one rr, so the genotypic ratio is:\n\n1. Genotypic Ratio: 1 RR : 2 Rr : 1 rr\n\nSince the red color is dominant over the white color, the phenotypic ratio is based on the presence of the dominant allele (R). The RR and Rr genotypes will both result in red flowers, while the rr genotype will result in a white flower. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n2. Phenotypic Ratio: 2 Red : 1 White\n\n3. Explanation: The Punnett square shows that there is a 25% chance of RR, 50% chance of Rr, and 25% chance of rr. Therefore, the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 and the phenotypic ratio is 2:1 since RR and Rr both result in red flowers, and rr results in a white flower."
