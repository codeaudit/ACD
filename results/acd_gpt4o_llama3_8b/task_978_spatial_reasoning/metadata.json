This specific type of spatial reasoning can be considered challenging for LLMs, as it requires understanding and processing complex relationships between objects in a described space, which is different from simple language understanding tasks.\n\nGiven the context, let's examine the specific example provided:\n\n**Example Instruction:**\nInterpret the following spatial description and make an inference based on it:\n- Description: Imagine you are standing in a room with the following items: A chair is to the left of a table.

While LLMs can handle many language tasks well, spatial reasoning often requires a higher level of abstraction and understanding of physical relationships, which might not be as well-developed in LLMs as their language processing abilities.\n\nIn this case, the LLM succeeded in providing the correct spatial relationship: \"The painting is directly opposite the bookshelf.\" This indicates that the LLM was able to correctly interpret the spatial description and make the necessary inference.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Spatial Reasoning Complexity:** Spatial reasoning is inherently more challenging because it involves understanding and processing relationships in a physical space, which LLMs may not be specifically trained for.\n2. **Success in a Difficult Task:** Given the estimated human difficulty is \"difficult,\" the LLM's success indicates a noteworthy ability to handle complex spatial descriptions.\n3. **Evaluation Method:** The evaluation method using `eval_with_llm_judge` seems appropriate, as it checks if the response correctly matches the expected spatial relationship.\n\n### Decision:\n**Decision: Yes**"
