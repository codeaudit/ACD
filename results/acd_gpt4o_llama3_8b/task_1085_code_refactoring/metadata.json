If the remainder is 0, it's a factor and is appended to the list.\n- The refactored code uses a list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise and readable way. This is a more Pythonic way to solve this problem.\n- I added a docstring to the function to describe its purpose and behavior, making it easier for others to understand how to use the function.\n- I removed unnecessary comments, as the code is now self-explanatory.\n- The function name `calculate_factors` is clear and descriptive, making it easy to understand its purpose.\n- The variable name `factors` is also clear and descriptive, making it easy to understand its purpose.\n- I did not change the functionality of the code, only improved its readability and maintainability.",

This improves readability and makes the function more discoverable.\n- The loop now only goes up to the square root of `n`, because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been accounted for. This improves efficiency.\n- To avoid duplicates, we append both `i` and `n // i` to the list of factors when `i` is a factor of `n`. If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, it means we have found a distinct factor.\n- The list of factors is sorted before being returned, which makes the output more consistent and easier to read.",
