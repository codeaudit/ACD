            "Description: \nBubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\nSteps:\n1. Start from the beginning of the list and compare the first two elements. If they are in the wrong order, swap them.\n2. Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swapping process.\n3. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.\n4. Repeat the process until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\nHowever, the above approach is not the most efficient way to implement bubble sort. A more efficient approach is to keep track of the number of swaps made in each pass. If no swaps are made in a pass, it means the list is already sorted and we can terminate the algorithm early.\n\nHere are the detailed steps for the efficient implementation:\n\n1. Initialize a variable 'swapped' to True.\n2. While 'swapped' is True, iterate through the list and compare adjacent elements.\n3. If a swap is made, set 'swapped' to True.\n4. If no swap is made, set 'swapped' to False.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until 'swapped' is False or the list is sorted.\n\nTime Complexity:\nBubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case scenario, where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm compares each pair of elements n-1 times.\n\nSpace Complexity:\nBubble sort has a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the temporary swap variable and the 'swapped' flag.\n\nCode:\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sorts the input array using the bubble sort algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: The sorted array.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    swapped = True\n\n    while swapped:\n        swapped = False\n        for i in range(n-1):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:\n                # Swap arr[i] and arr[i+1]\n                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]\n                swapped = True\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\nIn this code, we define a function `bubble_sort` that takes an array as input and returns the sorted array. We use a while loop to repeatedly iterate through the array and compare adjacent elements. If a swap is made, we set the 'swapped' flag to True. If no swap is made, we set the 'swapped' flag to False. We repeat this process until the 'swapped' flag is False or the array is sorted. Finally, we return the sorted array.",

If they are in the wrong order, swap them.\n3.  Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.\n4.  Repeat steps 1-3 until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\nHowever, bubble sort can be optimized by adding a flag that checks if any swaps were made in the last pass. If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted and the algorithm can terminate early.\n\nTime Complexity: \nThe time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the algorithm involves nested loops that compare each pair of elements in the list.\n\nSpace Complexity: \nThe space complexity of bubble sort is O(1), which means it requires a constant amount of additional space to store the temporary variables used during the sorting process.\n\nCode: \n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(\"Original array:\", arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", bubble_sort(arr))\n```\n\nIn this code, the `bubble_sort` function takes an array as input and returns the sorted array.

Start with a sorted list of items. The list must be sorted in ascending or descending order.\n2.  Define the low and high pointers, which represent the current range of the list we're searching. Initially, low is set to 0 (the first item in the list) and high is set to the last index of the list.\n3.  While the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer, we can continue searching.\n4.  Calculate the mid index, which is the average of the low and high pointers. This represents the middle item in the current range.\n5.  Compare the target item to the item at the mid index. If the target item is equal to the item at the mid index, we've found the target item and can return the mid index.\n6.  If the target item is less than the item at the mid index, we know the target item must be in the left half of the list. We update the high pointer to the mid index - 1 to narrow the search range.\n7.  If the target item is greater than the item at the mid index, we know the target item must be in the right half of the list. We update the low pointer to the mid index + 1 to narrow the search range.\n8.  We repeat steps 4-7 until we find the target item or the low pointer is greater than the high pointer, indicating that the target item is not in the list.\n\nTime Complexity: \nThe time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of items in the list. This is because we divide the search range in half with each iteration, resulting in a logarithmic number of iterations.\n\nSpace Complexity: \nThe space complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of additional space. This is because we only need to store the low and high pointers, which take up a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the list.\n\nCode:\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\nThis code implements the binary search algorithm in Python.

Start with a sorted list of items.\n2. Find the middle index of the list.\n3. Compare the target value to the middle element in the list.\n4. If the target value is equal to the middle element, return the index.\n5. If the target value is less than the middle element, repeat the process with the left half of the list.\n6. If the target value is greater than the middle element, repeat the process with the right half of the list.\n7. Continue this process until the target value is found, or until the list has been narrowed down to zero elements.\n\nTime Complexity: The time complexity of binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of items in the list. This is because with each iteration, we are effectively cutting the number of possible locations in half.\n\nSpace Complexity: The space complexity of binary search is O(1), which means the space used does not grow with the size of the input. This is because we only need a constant amount of space to store the necessary variables.\n\nCode: \n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```",
            "Description: \nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the array that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n\nSteps: \n1.  The algorithm starts by defining a sorted array and a target element to search for.\n2.  It calculates the middle index of the array and compares the target element with the middle element of the array.\n3.  If the target element matches the middle element, the algorithm returns the index of the middle element. If not, it determines whether the target is less than or greater than the middle element and updates the search range accordingly.\n4.  The process is repeated until the target element is found or it's determined that the target element is not in the array.\n5.  The algorithm terminates when the search range is empty, indicating that the target element is not in the array.\n\nTime Complexity: \nThe time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because with each iteration, the algorithm effectively halves the search space, reducing the number of comparisons required to find the target element.\n\nSpace Complexity: \nThe space complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of additional memory to store the target element and the indices of the search range.\n\nCode: \n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return -1  # Return -1 if the target is not found\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ntarget = 5\nindex = binary_search(arr, target)\nif index != -1:\n    print(f\"Target {target} found at index {index}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Target {target} not found in the array\")\n```",
            "Description: \nThe binary search algorithm is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed the possible locations to just one.\n\nSteps: \nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the binary search algorithm works:\n\n1.  Start with a sorted list of items. The list must be sorted in ascending or descending order.\n2.  Define the low and high pointers, which represent the current range of the list we're searching. Initially, low is set to 0 (the first item in the list) and high is set to the last index of the list.\n3.  While the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer, we can continue searching.\n4.  Calculate the mid index, which is the average of the low and high pointers. This represents the middle item in the current range.\n5.  Compare the target item to the item at the mid index. If the target item is equal to the item at the mid index, we've found the target item and can return the mid index.\n6.  If the target item is less than the item at the mid index, we know the target item must be in the left half of the list. We update the high pointer to the mid index - 1 to narrow the search range.\n7.  If the target item is greater than the item at the mid index, we know the target item must be in the right half of the list. We update the low pointer to the mid index + 1 to narrow the search range.\n8.  We repeat steps 4-7 until we find the target item or the low pointer is greater than the high pointer, indicating that the target item is not in the list.\n\nTime Complexity: \nThe time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of items in the list. This is because we divide the search range in half with each iteration, resulting in a logarithmic number of iterations.\n\nSpace Complexity: \nThe space complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of additional space. This is because we only need to store the low and high pointers, which take up a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the list.\n\nCode:\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return -1\n```\nThis code implements the binary search algorithm in Python. It takes a sorted list `arr` and a target item `target` as input, and returns the index of the target item if it exists in the list, or -1 if it does not."
