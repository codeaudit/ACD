            "To burn the midnight oil is a common English idiom that means to work late into the night, often to meet a deadline or complete a task. \n\nThe phrase translates to a common French idiom: \"en finir avec la nuit\". This is not a direct translation, but it captures the essence of working late into the night. However, a more idiomatic translation would be: \"br\u00fbler la paille du samedi soir\" (burn the straw of Saturday evening), this idiom is often used in Quebec, but the more widely used idiom is: \"br\u00fbler la paille\" (burn the straw).",
            "To plan my solution, I will consider the idiomatic meaning of the phrase \"To burn the midnight oil.\" This phrase is an English idiom that means to work late into the night, often to meet a deadline or complete a task. It is a metaphorical expression that suggests burning oil in a lamp late at night, which is a common way to light a room in the past.\n\nTo translate this idiom into French while preserving its original meaning, I will look for a phrase that conveys the same sense of working late into the night, but is specific to the French culture. \n\nThe French idiom that comes closest to this meaning is \"Se couper la poire.\" However, this idiom means to spend hours doing something tedious or boring, which doesn't entirely capture the sense of working late to meet a deadline. \n\nAnother option is the expression \"Faire de la gr\u00e8ve de nuit,\" which means to work late at night, but it implies a sense of protest or strike, which isn't the intended meaning here.\n\nA more suitable translation would be \"Faire la nuit,\" which means to work at night, but it's not as idiomatic as \"To burn the midnight oil.\" \n\nHowever, the most common and idiomatic translation of this phrase in French is \"Br\u00fbler la lampe \u00e0 l'huile,\" which literally means \"To burn the oil in the lamp,\" and it carries the same sense of working late into the night as the original phrase.\n\nTranslation: Br\u00fbler la lampe \u00e0 l'huile",
            "To reason about this task, I will consider the cultural context and idiomatic meaning of the original phrase \"to burn the midnight oil\". This phrase is a common English idiom that originated in the 17th century, when people used oil lamps as their primary source of light for reading and working. Working late into the night meant burning more oil than usual, hence the phrase.\n\nConsidering the French culture and language, I will look for a phrase that conveys the same meaning and idiomatic nuance. French has a rich tradition of using idiomatic expressions that are specific to the culture.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I propose the following translation:\n\nTranslation: Faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires apr\u00e8s minuit.\n\nThis translation captures the essence of the original phrase by using the French expression \"faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires\", which means \"to work extra hours\", and combining it with \"apr\u00e8s minuit\", meaning \"after midnight\". This phrase accurately conveys the idea of working late into the night, preserving the cultural context and idiomatic meaning of the original phrase.",

            "To burn the midnight oil is a common English idiom that means to work late into the night, often to meet a deadline or complete a task. \n\nThe phrase translates to a common French idiom: \"en finir avec la nuit\". This is not a direct translation, but it captures the essence of working late into the night. However, a more idiomatic translation would be: \"br\u00fbler la paille du samedi soir\" (burn the straw of Saturday evening), this idiom is often used in Quebec, but the more widely used idiom is: \"br\u00fbler la paille\" (burn the straw).",
            "To plan my solution, I will consider the idiomatic meaning of the phrase \"To burn the midnight oil.\" This phrase is an English idiom that means to work late into the night, often to meet a deadline or complete a task. It is a metaphorical expression that suggests burning oil in a lamp late at night, which is a common way to light a room in the past.\n\nTo translate this idiom into French while preserving its original meaning, I will look for a phrase that conveys the same sense of working late into the night, but is specific to the French culture. \n\nThe French idiom that comes closest to this meaning is \"Se couper la poire.\" However, this idiom means to spend hours doing something tedious or boring, which doesn't entirely capture the sense of working late to meet a deadline. \n\nAnother option is the expression \"Faire de la gr\u00e8ve de nuit,\" which means to work late at night, but it implies a sense of protest or strike, which isn't the intended meaning here.\n\nA more suitable translation would be \"Faire la nuit,\" which means to work at night, but it's not as idiomatic as \"To burn the midnight oil.\" \n\nHowever, the most common and idiomatic translation of this phrase in French is \"Br\u00fbler la lampe \u00e0 l'huile,\" which literally means \"To burn the oil in the lamp,\" and it carries the same sense of working late into the night as the original phrase.\n\nTranslation: Br\u00fbler la lampe \u00e0 l'huile",
            "To reason about this task, I will consider the cultural context and idiomatic meaning of the original phrase \"to burn the midnight oil\". This phrase is a common English idiom that originated in the 17th century, when people used oil lamps as their primary source of light for reading and working. Working late into the night meant burning more oil than usual, hence the phrase.\n\nConsidering the French culture and language, I will look for a phrase that conveys the same meaning and idiomatic nuance. French has a rich tradition of using idiomatic expressions that are specific to the culture.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I propose the following translation:\n\nTranslation: Faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires apr\u00e8s minuit.\n\nThis translation captures the essence of the original phrase by using the French expression \"faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires\", which means \"to work extra hours\", and combining it with \"apr\u00e8s minuit\", meaning \"after midnight\". This phrase accurately conveys the idea of working late into the night, preserving the cultural context and idiomatic meaning of the original phrase.",

The task measures cultural understanding, linguistic diversity, and translation skills, and is estimated to be difficult.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Cultural Understanding and Linguistic Diversity:**\n   - Translating idioms and culturally specific phrases requires a deep understanding of both the source and target cultures, as idioms do not have direct translations and often rely on cultural context.\n   - LLMs have been trained on vast amounts of multilingual data, including idiomatic expressions and cultural contexts, which can help them perform well in such tasks.\n\n2. **Translation Skills:**\n   - Modern LLMs, particularly those with fine-tuning on translation tasks, have demonstrated strong performance in translation, including handling idiomatic expressions.\n   - The model's ability to understand and translate idioms while preserving their meaning is a sophisticated skill but within the capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method:**\n   - The task uses `eval_with_llm_judge` for evaluation, which implies that another LLM or a similar automated method is used to judge the quality of the translation.\n   - While automated evaluation can be efficient, it may not perfectly capture the nuances of idiomatic translations, which could affect the reliability of the scoring.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the capabilities of advanced LLMs, it is not surprising that the LLM agent succeeded at this task. These models are typically proficient in handling translations, including idiomatic and culturally specific phrases, due to their extensive training data and sophisticated language understanding.\n\nDecision: No"
