This requires not just understanding musical theory but also applying it in a creative and coherent manner.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The scoring function depends on another LLM to judge the output based on specific criteria. While LLMs can evaluate text-based responses to some extent, the nuances of musical composition and style adherence might be more challenging to assess accurately.
