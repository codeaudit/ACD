This means Alex must be sitting in the middle position.\n\nHowever, the second clue states that Blake is sitting to the left of Casey. Since Blake is sitting to the left of Casey, and Alex is not at either end, this means Alex cannot be in the middle position. This creates a contradiction.\n\nBut let's re-examine the second clue: \"Blake is sitting to the left of Casey.\" This means that Blake and Casey must be in the first two positions, with Blake being at the first position and Casey at the second position. This would place Alex in the middle position, as Alex is not at either end.\n\nSo, considering both clues, we can conclude that Alex is indeed sitting in the middle position.\n\nAnswer: Alex",

These are tasks that require the model to process the given clues and apply logical deductions to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Task Analysis\n1. **Logical Reasoning**: The model needs to understand the constraints provided by the clues and make logical deductions.\n2. **Problem-Solving**: It must apply those deductions to figure out the correct arrangement or solution.\n3. **Text Interpretation**: The model must accurately parse the clues provided in natural language.\n\n### Example Task\n- **Puzzle**: \"Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are sitting in a row. Alex is not sitting at either end. Blake is sitting to the left of Casey. Who is sitting in the middle?\"\n- **Solution**: Based on the clues:\n  - Alex cannot be at either end.\n  - Blake must be to the left of Casey.\n  - Therefore, Alex must be in the middle, Blake must be on the left, and Casey must be on the right.\n  - The correct answer is \"Blake.\"\n\n### Implementation Check\n- The task instructions are clearly provided to the model.\n- The scoring mechanism uses `eval_with_llm_judge` to check if the provided criteria are met.\n- Criteria include correct answer formatting, logical derivation, and correctness of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning\nGiven the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, they have demonstrated strong proficiency in:\n- Parsing complex text.\n- Understanding logical relationships.\n- Applying reasoning to arrive at solutions.\n  \nWhile solving logic puzzles can be challenging, especially those requiring multiple steps of logical deduction, the example provided is relatively straightforward. The clues are direct, and the logical deductions required are not overly complex.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the above analysis, it is not surprising that an LLM succeeded at this task. The task involves basic logical reasoning and text interpretation, which are within the expected capabilities of modern LLMs.\n\n**Decision: No**"
