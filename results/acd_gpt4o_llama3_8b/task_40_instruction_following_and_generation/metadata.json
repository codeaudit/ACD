            "Instructions:\n1. Step one: Determine the garden size and location. Choose a spot that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight a day and has good drainage. Mark out a rectangular area of approximately 4x8 feet to create a manageable garden space.\n2. Step two: Prepare the soil. Dig up the marked area to a depth of about 8 inches, loosening the soil as you go. Remove any debris, rocks, or weeds. If your soil is heavy clay or sandy, mix in some organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve its structure.\n3. Step three: Create a raised bed. If your garden is on a slope or has poor drainage, consider building a raised bed using wood or composite materials. This will help to level the ground and improve soil quality.\n4. Step four: Plan the garden layout. Divide the garden into sections or beds, each dedicated to a specific type of vegetable. Consider companion planting to maximize space and minimize pests. Some examples of companion planting include planting marigolds with tomatoes to deter nematodes, or basil with lettuce to improve flavor.\n5. Step five: Choose the vegetables. Select a variety of vegetables that thrive in your climate and will mature at different times. Some examples include:\n\t* Spring crops: lettuce, spinach, peas, carrots\n\t* Summer crops: tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, bell peppers\n\t* Fall crops: broccoli, kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts\n6. Step six: Create a planting schedule. Based on the selected vegetables, create a schedule for planting and harvesting. For example:\n\t* Plant lettuce and spinach in early spring, about 2-3 weeks before the last frost date.\n\t* Plant tomatoes and cucumbers in late spring, when the soil has warmed up.\n\t* Plant broccoli and Brussels sprouts in early fall, about 8 weeks before the first frost date.\n7. Step seven: Plant the vegetables. Follow the specific planting instructions for each type of vegetable, taking into account factors like spacing, depth, and soil pH.\n8. Step eight: Mulch and water. Apply a layer of organic mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Water the garden regularly, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to disease and pests.\n\nOutcome:\n1. Result of step one: A 4x8 foot garden space has been marked out in a sunny location with good drainage.\n2. Result of step two: The soil has been loosened and debris removed, with organic matter added to improve its structure.\n3. Result of step three: A raised bed has been built to level the ground and improve soil quality.\n4. Result of step four: The garden has been divided into sections or beds, each dedicated to a specific type of vegetable, with companion planting in mind.\n5. Result of step five: A variety of vegetables has been selected for the garden, including spring, summer, and fall crops.\n6. Result of step six: A planting schedule has been created, taking into account the specific planting and harvesting times for each type of vegetable.\n7. Result of step seven: The vegetables have been planted according to their specific instructions, with spacing, depth, and soil pH in mind.\n8.

            "Instructions:\n1. Step one: Determine the garden size and location. Choose a spot that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight a day and has good drainage. Mark out a rectangular area of approximately 4x8 feet to create a manageable garden space.\n2. Step two: Prepare the soil. Dig up the marked area to a depth of about 8 inches, loosening the soil as you go. Remove any debris, rocks, or weeds. If your soil is heavy clay or sandy, mix in some organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure to improve its structure.\n3. Step three: Create a raised bed. If your garden is on a slope or has poor drainage, consider building a raised bed using wood or composite materials. This will help to level the ground and improve soil quality.\n4. Step four: Plan the garden layout. Divide the garden into sections or beds, each dedicated to a specific type of vegetable. Consider companion planting to maximize space and minimize pests. Some examples of companion planting include planting marigolds with tomatoes to deter nematodes, or basil with lettuce to improve flavor.\n5. Step five: Choose the vegetables. Select a variety of vegetables that thrive in your climate and will mature at different times. Some examples include:\n\t* Spring crops: lettuce, spinach, peas, carrots\n\t* Summer crops: tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, bell peppers\n\t* Fall crops: broccoli, kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts\n6. Step six: Create a planting schedule. Based on the selected vegetables, create a schedule for planting and harvesting. For example:\n\t* Plant lettuce and spinach in early spring, about 2-3 weeks before the last frost date.\n\t* Plant tomatoes and cucumbers in late spring, when the soil has warmed up.\n\t* Plant broccoli and Brussels sprouts in early fall, about 8 weeks before the first frost date.\n7. Step seven: Plant the vegetables. Follow the specific planting instructions for each type of vegetable, taking into account factors like spacing, depth, and soil pH.\n8. Step eight: Mulch and water.
