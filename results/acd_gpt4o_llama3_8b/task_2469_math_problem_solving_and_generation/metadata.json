            "Problem: Evaluate the definite integral of the function f(x) = (2x^2 + 3x - 1) / (x^2 + 4) from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nSolution: \u222b[0,1] (2x^2 + 3x - 1) / (x^2 + 4) dx = [ln|x^2 + 4| + (2x + 3) / sqrt(x^2 + 4) - 1 / sqrt(x^2 + 4)] from 0 to 1.\n\nExplanation: To evaluate this integral, we can use the method of substitution. We start by setting u = x^2 + 4, which means du/dx = 2x. This allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of u, which simplifies the expression and makes it easier to integrate. We then substitute the limits of integration to find the final answer.",
            "Problem: Find the area under the curve of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 from x = 0 to x = 4.\n\nSolution: \u222b[0,4] (3x^2 + 2x - 5) dx = [(3/3)x^3 + (2/2)x^2 - 5x] from 0 to 4 = [(1/3)x^3 + x^2 - 5x] from 0 to 4 = [(1/3)(4)^3 + (4)^2 - 5(4)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (0)^2 - 5(0)] = [(64/3) + 16 - 20] - 0 = (64/3) - 4 = 64/3 - 12/3 = 52/3.\n\nExplanation: To solve this problem, we first need to integrate the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 with respect to x. We can do this by applying the power rule of integration, which states that \u222bx^n dx = (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is a constant. We can also use the constant multiple rule of integration, which states that \u222bk*f(x) dx = k*\u222bf(x) dx, where k is a constant. Using these rules, we can integrate the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 as follows: \u222b(3x^2 + 2x - 5) dx = \u222b3x^2 dx + \u222b2x dx - \u222b5 dx = [(3/3)x^3] + [(2/2)x^2] - [5x] + C = x^3 + x^2 - 5x + C. Now, we need to evaluate this integral from x = 0 to x = 4. To do this, we can plug in the upper and lower limits of integration and subtract the results: [(1/3)x^3 + x^2 - 5x] from 0 to 4 = [(1/3)(4)^3 + (4)^2 - 5(4)] - [(1/3)(0)^3 + (0)^2 - 5(0)] = [(64/3) + 16 - 20] - 0 = (64/3) - 4 = 64/3 - 12/3 = 52/3.",

Then, we evaluate F(x) at the limits of integration, x = 0 and x = 4, and subtract the results to find the area under the curve. This is done using the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that the definite integral of a function is equal to the antiderivative of the function evaluated at the limits of integration.",

Let's break down the tasks to see if the agent's success is surprising.\n\n1. **Task 1: Solving the Integral**\n    - The integral given is: \u222b(5x^5 - 4x^4 + 3x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 7) dx.\n    - This integral involves basic polynomial integration, which is typically within the capabilities of advanced LLMs, as they have been trained on a large corpus of mathematical texts and problems.\n    - LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have shown proficiency in solving such integrals correctly and providing detailed explanations.\n\n2. **Task 2: Generating a New Problem**\n    - Generating a new calculus problem involving integration and ensuring it has a similar level of complexity requires not only understanding of the problem-solving process but also creativity and problem formulation skills.\n    - Advanced LLMs have demonstrated the ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate problems along with correct solutions and explanations, although this is a more complex task than simply solving a given problem.\n\n**LLM Judge Suitability:**\n- The use of an LLM judge to evaluate the solution and explanation for correctness and logical reasoning is appropriate given the nature of the tasks. Advanced LLMs can understand and evaluate mathematical reasoning effectively.\n\n**Implementation Check:**\n- The task implementation appears correct, with clear instructions and appropriate validation criteria for scoring.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The success of the LLM agent in solving the integral (Task 1) is not surprising, given the capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n- The success in generating a new problem with a correct solution and explanation (Task 2) is more complex but still within the capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\n**Decision: No**"
