Gather the materials: Collect a rectangular piece of cardboard for the base of the house, scissors, a roll of tape, and a set of markers.\n2. Cut the base: Cut the cardboard into a rectangular shape, approximately 6 inches wide and 4 inches long. This will be the foundation of the house.\n3. Cut the walls: Cut two longer rectangular shapes from the remaining cardboard, each approximately 6 inches wide and 8 inches long. These will be the side walls of the house.\n4. Cut the roof: Cut a triangular shape from the remaining cardboard, approximately 6 inches wide at the base and 4 inches tall. This will be the roof of the house.\n5. Assemble the walls: Use tape to attach the two side walls to the base, making sure they are evenly spaced and secure.\n6. Add the roof: Place the triangular roof on top of the house, securing it with tape.\n7. Decorate the house: Use markers to draw windows, a door, and any other details you like on the house.\n8. Add finishing touches: Use more markers to add color and texture to the house, if desired.\n9. Final check: Make sure the house is stable and secure before displaying or playing with it.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a simple model house using cardboard and basic crafting supplies.",
            "To build a small model house using cardboard, scissors, tape, and markers, follow these steps:\n\n1. Cut a rectangular shape from the cardboard to create the base of the house. The size should be around 4 inches by 6 inches.\n\n2. Cut two rectangular shapes with the same dimensions as the base, but slightly smaller. These will be the sides of the house. \n\n3. Cut two smaller rectangular shapes for the front and back of the house. These should be around 2 inches by 4 inches.\n\n4. Cut a triangular shape for the roof of the house. This should be around 4 inches by 2 inches at the base and tapering to a point at the top.\n\n5. Use tape to attach the sides of the house to the base, making sure they are even and secure.\n\n6. Use tape to attach the front and back of the house to the sides, again ensuring they are even and secure.\n\n7. Attach the roof to the top of the house using tape, making sure it is centered and secure.\n\n8. Use markers to add details such as windows, doors, and any other features you want to include.\n\n9.

Use the scissors to cut out a small rectangular shape from the front rectangle for the door.\n\n3. Use the markers to draw windows and a door on the front and back rectangles. You can add details such as shutters, a mailbox, or a chimney if desired.\n\n4. Use the tape to assemble the base, sides, and back of the house by gluing them together.\n\n5. Place the front and back panels onto the sides, making sure they are aligned and secure with tape.\n\n6. Use the tape to attach the small square roof to the top of the house, creating a slight angle to represent the slope of a roof.\n\n7. Add the door and any other details you drew in step 3 using the markers.\n\n8.

Gather and cut the cardboard: Collect several pieces of cardboard, ideally from cereal boxes or other flat packaging materials. Cut them into the following shapes: two rectangular pieces for the sides, one rectangular piece for the back, one rectangular piece for the front, one square piece for the roof, and one small rectangular piece for the door.\n\n2. Assemble the sides and back: Use tape to attach the sides and back pieces together, forming a rectangular shape. Make sure the edges are aligned and the corners are secure.\n\n3. Attach the front piece: Use tape to attach the front piece to the sides and back, creating a rectangular shape with a flat front.\n\n4. Create the roof: Cut the square piece of cardboard to fit on top of the house, with a slight overhang on each side. Use tape to secure it in place.\n\n5.

Make sure the rectangles are the same size and have a slightly thicker part at the bottom for the base of the house.\n\n2. Cut out a smaller rectangle for the door and a triangle for the roof. The door should be slightly smaller than the rectangular walls, and the triangle should be large enough to cover the top of the walls. Cut out a small rectangle for the window, which should be slightly smaller than the door.\n\n3. Use tape to stick the walls together, forming a rectangular shape with the thicker part at the bottom. Make sure the edges are aligned and the corners are secure.\n\n4. Attach the door and window to the walls using tape. Make sure they are evenly spaced and securely attached.\n\n5. Use the triangle-shaped piece for the roof by gluing or taping it onto the top of the walls. Make sure it is centered and even.\n\n6. Use markers to draw windows, doors, and other details on the model house. You can also add a chimney, a mailbox, or other decorative elements.\n\n7.

The task involves taking a set of materials and generating a coherent set of instructions to build an object, which falls within the capabilities of LLMs.\n\n2. **Practical Reasoning**: This is slightly more challenging, as it requires the LLM to have some practical understanding of how to use the materials to build the object. However, LLMs have been trained on diverse data, including instructions and descriptions of physical tasks, so they should be capable of generating reasonable steps.\n\n3. **Instructional Generation**: LLMs are proficient at generating text in a structured format. Given clear instructions, they can produce step-by-step guides effectively.\n\n4. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The use of an LLM judge for evaluation adds another layer of complexity. However, since the criteria are well-defined (clarity, feasibility, detail, numbered steps, word length), an LLM judge can reasonably assess the quality of the generated instructions.\n\nConsidering these factors, the success of the LLM agent in this task is not surprising. The task aligns well with the known strengths of LLMs, and the automated evaluation criteria are straightforward and suitable for the task.\n\nDecision: No"
