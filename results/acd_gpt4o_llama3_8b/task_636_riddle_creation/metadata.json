While LLMs are generally good at generating text and can understand themes, creating clever and engaging riddles that use wordplay or lateral thinking is a complex task.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, which suggests that it is non-trivial and requires a high degree of creativity and nuanced understanding of language.\n\n3. **Evaluation Criteria**: The criteria for success include the riddle being based on the given theme, being clever and engaging, and having a solution that makes sense and is accurate. These criteria are subjective and nuanced, making them challenging to evaluate even for a human, let alone an LLM.\n\n4. **Scoring Method**: The scoring is done via an LLM judge, which evaluates based on the provided criteria. While LLMs can evaluate text to some extent, the subjective nature of \"clever and engaging\" riddles makes this a challenging evaluation task.\n\n5. **Expected LLM Performance**: While LLMs can generate coherent and themed text, generating riddles that meet all the criteria (especially being clever and engaging) is quite challenging. Therefore, an LLM succeeding at this task is noteworthy.\n\nBased on the above points, the success of the LLM on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy due to the high complexity and subjective nature of the task.\n\nDecision: Yes"
