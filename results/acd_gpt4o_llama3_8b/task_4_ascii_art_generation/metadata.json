To fit within a 10x10 grid, I will prioritize the square body and the door, as they can be easily represented within the grid.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.

Represent the door: It will be placed in the middle of the square body, using a simple ' | ' to denote the door frame.\n3.

I will choose a square body of size 4x4 and a triangular roof of size 3x3.\n2. Create the square body: I will use the '/' character to create the body of the house, which will be a 4x4 square. I will place the square in the middle of the grid to leave space for the door and the roof.\n3. Create the door: I will use the '|' character to create the door, which will be a vertical line in the middle of the square body.\n4.

To fit within a 10x10 grid, I will prioritize the square body and the door, as they can be easily represented within the grid.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. Represent the square body of the house: It will occupy the middle 4x4 cells (3x3 to account for the door and the edges). This will leave space for the triangular roof and the door.\n2. Represent the door: It will be placed in the middle of the square body, using a simple ' | ' to denote the door frame.\n3. Represent the triangular roof: It will be placed above the square body, extending outwards from the center of the square body.

            "To create the ASCII art of a simple house within a 10x10 grid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the layout of the house within the 10x10 grid. The house will consist of a square body and a triangular roof. The door will be placed in the middle of the body.\n\n2. Calculate the dimensions of the square body that will fit within the grid while leaving enough space for the roof and door. Considering the grid size, I'll choose a square of size 4x4 to fit in the middle of the 10x10 grid, allowing for a triangular roof on top and space for a door.\n\n3. Plan the triangular roof. To ensure it fits within the grid, I'll decide on a triangular shape that's centered over the square body. A good fit for a triangular roof within a 4x4 square is a triangle with a base and height of 3 units. This will allow the triangle to fit within the square without exceeding the grid boundaries.\n\n4. Design the door and ensure it fits within the middle of the square body without extending beyond the boundaries of the grid.\n\nGiven the constraints and the description provided, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the plan:\n\n- The house's square body will occupy a 4x4 grid area, with the door positioned in the middle, occupying a 1x2 grid area.\n- The triangular roof will be positioned above the square body, spanning a 3x4 grid area.\n\nTo represent the house within a 10x10 grid, I'll adjust the size of the components to fit within this grid while maintaining the desired layout.

            "content": "Given the task family 'ascii_art_generation', there are several aspects to consider regarding the success of the LLM agent:\n\n1. **Spatial Reasoning and Descriptive Interpretation**: Generating ASCII art based on a textual description requires the model to understand the spatial arrangement of the described objects and accurately translate them into a visual format.\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is marked as difficult for humans, indicating that it is a challenging problem requiring a good grasp of spatial visualization and precision in representation.\n3. **Capabilities of LLMs**: While LLMs have been impressive in generating text, their ability to accurately create structured visual representations like ASCII art is generally less developed. This is because such tasks require a fine-grained understanding of spatial relations and visual structure, which is not a primary strength of language models.\n\nConsidering these points, if an LLM successfully generates accurate and recognizable ASCII art that fits the given description and adheres to the constraints (like fitting within a 10x10 grid), it would demonstrate a notable capability beyond typical language generation tasks. The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to assess the output adds an extra layer of scrutiny, ensuring that the success is genuine and not a fluke.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
