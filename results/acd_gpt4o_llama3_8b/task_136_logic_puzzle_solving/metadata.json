Since the person with the lily garden is next to the person with the tulip garden (clue 3), the order so far is rose, lily, tulip.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know the person with the daisy garden is at one end. Since the person with the daisy garden is next to the person with the sunflower garden (clue 4), the order so far is rose, lily, tulip, daisy, sunflower.\n\nNow, we have a complete order for the gardens. Based on their names, we can infer that Alice has the daisy garden, Bob has the lily garden, Carol has the sunflower garden, David has the rose garden, and Emily has the tulip garden.\n\nNow, for Task 2, let's assume the friends were wearing hats of different colors. Since we don't have any direct clues about the colors of the hats, we can arbitrarily assign them as follows: Alice wears a red hat, Bob wears a blue hat, and Carol wears a green hat.\n\nTask 1 solution: \n1.

            "To solve the puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step:\n\n1. Clue 1: Since the person with the rose garden is to the left of the person with the tulip garden, we can represent the order as: ? (rose), ?, tulip.\n2. Clue 2: The person with the daisy garden is at one end, which means the daisy garden is either at the leftmost end or the rightmost end.\n3. Clue 3: The person with the lily garden is next to the person with the tulip garden, which means the lily garden is either to the left or to the right of the tulip garden.\n4. Clue 4: The person with the daisy garden is next to the person with the sunflower garden, which means the sunflower garden is either to the left of the daisy garden or to the right of it.\n5. Clue 5: The person with the lily garden is in the middle, which means there are two gardens to the left and two gardens to the right of the lily garden.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know the lily garden is in the middle, which means the order is: ?, ?, ?, lily, ?, ?.\n\nCombining Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can determine that the lily garden is to the right of the tulip garden, so the order is: ?, ?, ?, ?, lily, tulip.\n\nFrom Clue 2, the daisy garden is at one end, and from Clue 4, the daisy garden is next to the sunflower garden, so the daisy and sunflower gardens must be at the ends. Since the daisy garden is at one end, the sunflower garden must be at the other end. The order is: daisy, ?, ?, ?, lily, tulip, sunflower.\n\nNow we can use Clue 1 again, which states that the person with the rose garden is to the left of the person with the tulip garden. This means the rose garden cannot be next to the lily garden, as the lily garden is in the middle and the tulip garden is to its right.\n\nThe only possible arrangement is: daisy, rose, ?, ?, lily, tulip, sunflower.\n\nSince there are only two people left, ?, we can determine that the remaining garden is either a lily or a tulip. However, Clue 3 states that the lily garden is next to the tulip garden, so the lily garden must be to the left of the tulip garden. This means the arrangement is: daisy, rose, lily, ?, tulip, sunflower.\n\nThe remaining garden is the daisy garden's neighbor, the sunflower garden's neighbor, or the tulip garden's neighbor. However, we already know that the lily garden is next to the tulip garden, and the daisy garden is next to the sunflower garden. Therefore, the only garden left is the violet garden.\n\nSo, the final arrangement is: daisy, rose, lily, violet, tulip, sunflower.\n\nTask 1: The gardens and their corresponding flowers in order are:\n1. Daisy - Violet\n2. Rose - Rose\n3. Lily - Lily\n4. Violet - Violet\n5. Tulip - Tulip\n6. Sunflower - Sunflower\n\nTask 2: Since there are only three people mentioned in the puzzle (Alice, Bob, and Carol), and they correspond to the daisy, rose, and lily gardens, we can determine their hats as follows:\n\nFor Task 2, list the colors of the hats for Alice, Bob, and Carol in that order.\n\nAnswer: Alice has a blue hat, Bob has a red hat, Carol has a green hat.",
            "To solve this puzzle, I will use the given clues to deduce the order of the gardens and their corresponding flowers.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know the person with the rose garden is to the left of the person with the tulip garden. \n\nFrom clue 5, we know the person with the lily garden is in the middle. Since the person with the lily garden is next to the person with the tulip garden (clue 3), the order so far is rose, lily, tulip.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know the person with the daisy garden is at one end. Since the person with the daisy garden is next to the person with the sunflower garden (clue 4), the order so far is rose, lily, tulip, daisy, sunflower.\n\nNow, we have a complete order for the gardens. Based on their names, we can infer that Alice has the daisy garden, Bob has the lily garden, Carol has the sunflower garden, David has the rose garden, and Emily has the tulip garden.\n\nNow, for Task 2, let's assume the friends were wearing hats of different colors. Since we don't have any direct clues about the colors of the hats, we can arbitrarily assign them as follows: Alice wears a red hat, Bob wears a blue hat, and Carol wears a green hat.\n\nTask 1 solution: \n1. David - Rose\n2. Bob - Lily\n3. Emily - Tulip\n4. Alice - Daisy\n5. Carol - Sunflower\n\nTask 2 solution: \n1. Alice - Red\n2. Bob - Blue\n3. Carol - Green",

The person with the daisy garden is next to the person with the sunflower garden.\n5. The person with the lily garden is in the middle.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know the lily garden is in the middle. Since the person with the tulip garden is next to the person with the lily garden (clue 3), the tulip garden must be either to the left or right of the lily garden.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know the rose garden is to the left of the tulip garden. This means the rose garden must be on the left end, and the tulip garden must be to its right.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know the daisy garden is next to the sunflower garden.

Tulip garden\n3. Lily garden (middle)\n4. Sunflower garden\n5. Daisy garden (right end)\n\nSince the person with the daisy garden is at one end and the person with the lily garden is in the middle, we can determine the order of the friends.

Based on the garden assignments, we can deduce the following:\n\n* Alice has the rose garden (left end)\n* Bob has the tulip garden\n* Carol has the lily garden (middle)\n* David has the sunflower garden\n* Emily has the daisy garden (right end)\n\nNow, let's move on to Task 2, which is not relevant to the puzzle at hand. Since there is no information about Alice, Bob, or Carol wearing hats, we cannot provide a solution for Task 2.\n\nHowever, if we were to assume that the friends are wearing hats of different colors, we could assign colors to each friend based on their garden assignments. For example:\n\n* Alice has the rose garden, so she wears a red hat.\n* Bob has the tulip garden, so he wears a yellow hat.\n* Carol has the lily garden, so she wears a white hat.\n* David has the sunflower garden, so he wears an orange hat.\n* Emily has the daisy garden, so she wears a pink hat.\n\nBut again, this is just a hypothetical assignment and not a solution to the original puzzle.\n\nAnswer: The gardens and their corresponding flowers in order are: Rose, Tulip, Lily, Sunflower, Daisy.",

            "To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:\n\n1. Alice says she does not know, which means she cannot see her own hat and the other two hats do not provide her with enough information to determine her own hat color.\n2. Bob says he does not know, which means he cannot see his own hat, but he can see the other two hats. However, since Alice also does not know, Bob's hat color must be different from both Alice's and Carol's hats.\n3. Carol says she knows, which means she has enough information to determine her own hat color.\n\nSince Carol knows her hat color, and Bob can see Carol's hat, but not his own, the only way Carol can be sure is if she sees two hats of the same color. If she sees two hats of different colors, she wouldn't know her own hat color. Therefore, Carol must be wearing a red hat (if she sees two red hats) or a blue hat (if she sees two blue hats).\n\nIf Carol is wearing a red hat, then Alice must be wearing a blue hat (because Bob doesn't know and can see the other two hats, and if Alice was wearing a red hat, Bob would know his own hat color). Similarly, if Carol is wearing a blue hat, then Alice must be wearing a red hat.\n\nNow, let's analyze Bob's statement. Bob says he doesn't know, which means he sees two hats of different colors. This is only possible if Carol is wearing a red hat and Alice is wearing a blue hat. If Carol was wearing a blue hat, Bob would know his own hat color.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:\n\nAlice's hat is blue.\nBob's hat is red.\nCarol's hat is red.\n\nAnswer: Alice's hat is blue, Bob's hat is red, Carol's hat is red.",

Alice says she doesn't know, which means she must see two hats of the same color. This is only possible in arrangements 1 and 3.\n2. Bob says he doesn't know, which means he must see two hats of the same color.
