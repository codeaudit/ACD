Three cities thrive in this enchanting world, each with its unique charm and role in the grand tapestry of fate.\n\nCity 1: Eldrador (The City of Wizards)\nEldrador, a metropolis of learning and magic, is home to the most esteemed wizards of the realm. Its grand towers and spires seem to defy gravity, as if the very fabric of reality has been woven with magical threads. The city is a hub of innovation and discovery, where the wise and the curious come to unravel the mysteries of the universe.\n\nCity 2: Calonia (The City of Merchants)\nCalonia, a bustling trade center, is a tapestry of cultures and commodities.

These are challenging aspects for LLMs, particularly when it involves generating coherent and creative content based on intricate requirements.\n\n2. **Output Format**: The task requires the map to be described in a plain text format, which includes detailed descriptions of cities or attractions. While generating text is a strength of LLMs, ensuring the format is followed precisely and the content is both creative and coherent adds a layer of difficulty.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The scoring is done using the `eval_with_llm_judge` method, which relies on another LLM to evaluate adherence to criteria. This method might not be as reliable as human evaluation, especially for tasks involving creativity and subjective assessments.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, which implies that succeeding at this task indicates a high level of capability in the LLM.\n\nConsidering the above points, if the LLM were to succeed at this task, it would be noteworthy due to the following reasons:\n- The task involves significant complexity and requires the LLM to exhibit advanced capabilities in spatial reasoning and creativity.\n- Ensuring precise adherence to the format and detailed, coherent descriptions of elements in the map is challenging.\n- The LLM's ability to succeed despite the difficulties associated with automatic evaluation by another LLM adds to the impressiveness.\n\nDecision: Yes"
