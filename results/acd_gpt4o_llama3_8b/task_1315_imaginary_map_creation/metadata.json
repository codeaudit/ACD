            "Map Description:\nThe fantasy island, known as Aethoria, is a lush and vibrant landmass with diverse geography and ecosystems. At its heart lies the majestic Aethorian Mountain Range, a sprawling mountain chain that stretches approximately 50 miles (80 km) in length and 20 miles (32 km) in width. The mountains are composed of rugged granite and slate, with peaks reaching elevations of up to 3,000 feet (900 meters) above sea level. The range is dotted with towering pines, their branches twisted by the constant winds, and crystal-clear lakes that reflect the sky like mirrors.\n\nFrom the mountains, three mighty rivers originate: the Azure River, the Emerald River, and the Ruby River. The Azure River, the longest of the three, flows eastward for approximately 30 miles (48 km) before emptying into the ocean, creating a scenic estuary that attracts a variety of marine life. The Emerald River flows northwest, passing through the dense Emerald Forest, a vast expanse of primeval greenery that covers over 100 square miles (260 square km). The forest is home to ancient trees, some of which have stood for centuries, their trunks as wide as houses and their canopies a kaleidoscope of colors.\n\nThe Ruby River, the smallest of the three, flows southwest, passing through the Ruby Forest, a smaller but equally vibrant woodland that covers around 50 square miles (130 square km). The Ruby Forest is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, thanks to the presence of a unique species of maple tree that has adapted to the island's unique soil composition.\n\nOn the western coast of Aethoria lies the charming coastal town of Brindlemark, a bustling hub of activity that serves as the island's primary settlement. Brindlemark is nestled between two rocky headlands, with the Azure River's estuary to the east and the ocean to the west. The town is surrounded by a sturdy stone wall, adorned with intricate carvings that depict the island's history and mythology. Brindlemark is home to a diverse population of Aethorians, who engage in various trades, from fishing and shipbuilding to blacksmithing and weaving.\n\nFinally, hidden away in the heart of the Emerald Forest lies the enigmatic Cave of the Ancients, a mysterious underground cavern system that has been shrouded in secrecy for centuries. The cave entrance is almost invisible, blending seamlessly into the surrounding foliage.
