The maze can have multiple paths and dead ends.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Initialize a 2D matrix `grid` with the maze layout, where 0 represents an open cell and 1 represents a blocked cell.\n2. Set the start cell (top-left) to `visited` and initialize the `queue` with the start cell coordinates.\n3. Create a `directions` array to represent the possible movements in the grid (up, down, left, right).\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Dequeue a cell from the queue and mark it as `visited`.\n\t* For each direction in the `directions` array:\n\t\t+ Calculate the new cell coordinates by applying the direction to the current cell.\n\t\t+ If the new cell is within the grid boundaries and is not blocked and not visited:\n\t\t\t- Mark the new cell as `visited`.\n\t\t\t- If the new cell is the end cell, return the path to the end cell.\n\t\t\t- Enqueue the new cell.\n5. If the queue is empty and the end cell has not been reached, return \"No path exists\".\n\n**Assumptions and Edge Cases:**\n\n* The maze is represented by a 2D grid with even dimensions (e.g., 5x5, 10x10).\n* The start cell is always at the top-left corner (0, 0) and the end cell is always at the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1).\n* The maze does not contain any cycles or self-loops.\n* The maze can have multiple paths and dead ends.\n\n**Example Input and Output:**\n\nInput:\n```\ngrid = [\n  [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nOutput:\n```\nPath: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n```\nIn this example, the algorithm finds the shortest path from the start cell (0, 0) to the end cell (4, 3) through the open cells in the maze.",
            "**Problem Description:**\nThe problem is to design an algorithm that finds the shortest path in a 2D grid maze from the start cell (top-left) to the end cell (bottom-right). The grid cells can be either open (0) or blocked (1). The algorithm should return the shortest path, or indicate if no path exists.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Initialize the grid and the start/end cell coordinates.\n2. Create a queue to hold the cells to be visited, and enqueue the start cell.\n3. Create a 2D array to store the distance to each cell, and initialize all distances to infinity except for the start cell, which is set to 0.\n4. Create a 2D array to store the previous cell in the shortest path, and initialize all values to null.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Dequeue the next cell to visit.\n   b. If the cell is the end cell, reconstruct the shortest path by backtracking from the end cell to the start cell using the previous cell array.\n   c. If the cell is blocked (1), skip it.\n   d. For each unvisited neighbor of the cell:\n      i. If the neighbor is open (0), calculate its tentative distance from the start cell through the current cell.\n      ii. If the calculated distance is less than the current distance to the neighbor, update the distance and previous cell for the neighbor.\n      iii. Enqueue the neighbor.\n6.

The grid is represented by a 2D array where 0 denotes an open cell and 1 denotes a blocked cell. The algorithm should return the shortest path as a sequence of coordinates (x, y) or indicate if no path exists.\n\n- Algorithm:\n1. Initialize a 2D array `distance` of the same size as the input grid, where all elements are set to infinity except for the top-left cell, which is set to 0. This array will be used to keep track of the shortest distance from the start cell to each cell in the grid.\n2. Initialize a 2D array `previous` of the same size as the input grid, where all elements are set to None. This array will be used to keep track of the previous cell in the shortest path.\n3. Create a queue and enqueue the start cell (top-left cell).\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a cell.\n5. For each neighbor (up, down, left, right) of the dequeued cell:\n    1. If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and is not blocked (i.e., the value at the neighbor's coordinates in the input grid is 0) and the distance to the neighbor from the start cell is greater than the current distance to the dequeued cell plus 1:\n        1. Update the distance to the neighbor by setting the value at the neighbor's coordinates in the `distance` array to the current distance to the dequeued cell plus 1.\n        2. Update the previous cell for the neighbor by setting the value at the neighbor's coordinates in the `previous` array to the coordinates of the dequeued cell.\n        3. Enqueue the neighbor.\n6. If the distance to the end cell (bottom-right cell) is still infinity, it means no path exists from the start cell to the end cell.\n7. Reconstruct the shortest path by starting from the end cell and following the previous cells until reaching the start cell.\n8. Return the shortest path as a sequence of coordinates.\n\n- Assumptions and Edge Cases:\n- The input grid is a rectangular 2D array.\n- The start cell is the top-left cell (0, 0).\n- The end cell is the bottom-right cell (number of rows - 1, number of columns - 1).\n- The grid does not contain any cells with negative values.\n- The grid does not contain any disconnected blocks.\n\n- Example Input and Output:\nInput:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\nThe start cell is (0, 0) and the end cell is (4, 4).\n\nThe expected output is a sequence of coordinates representing the shortest path from the start cell to the end cell:\n```\n[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]\n```\nNo path exists in this case, so the algorithm correctly indicates that no path exists from the start cell to the end cell.\n\nAnswer: \n[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4)]"
