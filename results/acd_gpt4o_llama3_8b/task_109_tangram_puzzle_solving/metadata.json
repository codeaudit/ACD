This suggests that the task might be inherently too difficult for the model's current capabilities. To ensure the task remains challenging but feasible, I will simplify it further. Instead of complex figures like \"cat\" and \"house,\" I will use simpler geometric shapes (e.g., \"square\" and \"triangle\") that can be formed using the provided tangram shapes. This should make the task more approachable while still testing spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n    \"name_of_task\": \"tangram_puzzle_solving\",\n    \"description_of_task\": \"Solve given tangram puzzles by arranging the provided shapes to form a specific figure.\",\n    \"capability_being_measured\": \"spatial reasoning and problem-solving\",\n    \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"3\",\n    \"done\": \"False\",\n    \"task_family\": \"class TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\n                \\\"shapes\\\": [\\n                    \\\"small_triangle_1\\\",\\n                    \\\"small_triangle_2\\\",\\n                    \\\"medium_triangle\\\",\\n                    \\\"large_triangle_1\\\",\\n                    \\\"large_triangle_2\\\",\\n                    \\\"square\\\",\\n                    \\\"parallelogram\\\"\\n                ],\\n                \\\"figure\\\": \\\"square\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\n                \\\"shapes\\\": [\\n                    \\\"small_triangle_1\\\",\\n                    \\\"small_triangle_2\\\",\\n                    \\\"medium_triangle\\\",\\n                    \\\"large_triangle_1\\\",\\n                    \\\"large_triangle_2\\\",\\n                    \\\"square\\\",\\n                    \\\"parallelogram\\\"\\n                ],\\n                \\\"figure\\\": \\\"triangle\\\"\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Solve the following tangram puzzle by arranging the provided shapes to form the specified figure:\\n\\nShapes: {', '.join(t['shapes'])}\\nFigure: {t['figure']}\\n\\nDescribe your solution as a sequence of steps detailing how to position each shape to form the figure.

            "content": "Given the task family described, here are my considerations:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: Tangram puzzles require spatial reasoning and the ability to visualize how different shapes can be arranged to form a specific figure. While this is a moderately challenging problem, it is traditionally more difficult for LLMs, which excel in text-based tasks rather than spatial reasoning.\n\n2. **Instruction Understanding**: The instructions require the LLM to output a sequence of steps describing the placement and orientation of shapes in relation to forming the specified figure. This involves not just understanding the instructions but also generating a coherent and logically sequenced response that meets the criteria.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to score the solution based on criteria like correctness of the arrangement, detail, coherence, and logical sequence suggests a sophisticated evaluation process. However, relying on another LLM to judge spatial reasoning tasks introduces uncertainty, as LLMs might not be inherently suited to evaluating spatial arrangements accurately.\n\n4. **LLM Capabilities**: While LLMs have advanced significantly, their strengths lie in natural language understanding and generation rather than in spatial reasoning. Success in this task would indicate an impressive level of understanding and application of spatial relationships, which is not a core strength of current LLMs.\n\nConsidering these points, the agent's success in solving a tangram puzzle by providing a detailed and coherent sequence of steps for arranging shapes to form a specific figure is indeed surprising and noteworthy. This success indicates a significant capability in an area where LLMs are typically weaker.\n\nDecision: Yes"
