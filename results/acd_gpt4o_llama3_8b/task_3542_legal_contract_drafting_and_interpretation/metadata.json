Given the difficulty level, this task family is estimated to be very difficult for humans as well.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Legal Reasoning**: This involves understanding legal terminology and principles, which is not common knowledge for most LLMs.\n2. **Comprehension**: The model must accurately understand and interpret detailed and specific legal scenarios.\n3. **Structured Text Generation**: Producing a structured and legally sound contract is challenging, as it involves not just generating text, but doing so in a precise, legally correct manner.\n\n### Evaluation Method:\nThe `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to evaluate the task, which may introduce some subjectivity, but it is a reasonable approach given the complexity. If the criteria are well-defined and the LLM judge is sophisticated enough, it can be a useful proxy for human evaluation. However, it's important to recognize the limitations of automated evaluation in nuanced tasks like legal drafting and interpretation.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that this task family is very challenging and requires specialized legal knowledge, the fact that the LLM agent succeeded at this task is indeed surprising.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDecision: Yes"
