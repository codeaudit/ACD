It uses the `numpy` library to generate the sine waves and the `sounddevice` library to play the music.

It then initializes an empty audio array and generates a sine wave for each frequency using `np.sin`. The waves are amplified to avoid clipping and added to the audio array.\n\nThe code then ensures that the highest value in the audio array is within the 16-bit range and converts the array to `int16` type. The music is then played using `sd.play`.\n\nTo display the plot of the audio signal, the code uses `plt.plot` to plot the time array against the audio array. The plot is drawn using `plt.draw` and paused for 30 seconds using `plt.pause`. The plot is then closed using `plt.close`.\n\nFinally, the code saves the music as a WAV file using `sd.write`.\n\nThis code meets the criteria by generating a short piece of music with a duration of 30 seconds and including at least three different frequencies.

It uses the `numpy` library to generate the sine waves and the `sounddevice` library to play the music. The `matplotlib` library is used to display a plot of the audio signal.\n\nThe code first sets the duration and sample rate of the music.

It then initializes an empty audio array and generates a sine wave for each frequency using `np.sin`. The waves are amplified to avoid clipping and added to the audio array.\n\nThe code then ensures that the highest value in the audio array is within the 16-bit range and converts the array to `int16` type. The music is then played using `sd.play`.\n\nTo display the plot of the audio signal, the code uses `plt.plot` to plot the time array against the audio array. The plot is drawn using `plt.draw` and paused for 30 seconds using `plt.pause`. The plot is then closed using `plt.close`.\n\nFinally, the code saves the music as a WAV file using `sd.write`.\n\nThis code meets the criteria by generating a short piece of music with a duration of 30 seconds and including at least three different frequencies.
