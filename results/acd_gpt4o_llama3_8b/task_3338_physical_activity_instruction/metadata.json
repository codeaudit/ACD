Make sure the surface is free from any slippery substances that could cause you to lose your grip.\n\n2. Step 2: Choose a comfortable position for your hands, placing them shoulder-width apart, directly under your shoulders, with your fingers facing forward or slightly inward. Ensure your hands are not too close together or too far apart, as this could affect the alignment of your body during the movement.\n\n3. Step 3: Position your feet shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between the balls of your feet, keeping your knees slightly bent if necessary. This stance helps maintain balance and stability throughout the exercise.\n\n4. Step 4: Engage your core muscles to maintain a straight line from head to heels. This is crucial for proper form and to avoid straining your back. Engage your abdominal muscles to maintain a stable, rigid position.\n\n5. Step 5: Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body, until your upper arms are at a 45-degree angle to your body. Avoid letting your hips sag or your back arch, maintaining a straight line from head to heels.\n\n6. Step 6: Keep your head in a neutral position, with your eyes focusing forward and your chin slightly tucked in, engaging your neck muscles to maintain control over the movement.\n\n7. Step 7: Lower your body down to the point where your chest nearly touches the ground. Make sure not to touch the ground with your chest; instead, stop just shy of it, maintaining engagement of your core muscles to support your body.\n\n8. Step 8: Push back up to the starting position by straightening your arms, ensuring your body remains in a straight line throughout the movement. This involves extending your elbows and returning to the starting position where your hands are directly under your shoulders, and your body forms a straight line from head to heels.\n\n9. Step 9: Rest for a brief moment before repeating the movement, avoiding holding the peak of the push-up for an extended period, as this can compromise proper form and increase the risk of injury.\n\n10. Step 10: Perform the push-ups at a controlled and steady pace, focusing on proper form and technique over the number of repetitions. Start with a manageable number of reps and gradually increase the count as you build strength and endurance.\n\nSafety Tips:\n\n- Warm up before performing push-ups with light stretching or light cardio to prevent injuries.\n- If you have any back or shoulder issues, consider modifying the exercise or consulting a healthcare professional for guidance.\n- Keep a focus on proper form and technique, rather than the number of repetitions.\n- Engage in regular stretching to maintain flexibility and prevent muscle imbalances.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\n\n- Allowing the hips to sag or the back to arch, compromising the straight line of the body.\n- Letting the elbows flare out to the sides or forward, which can strain the shoulders and compromise form.\n- Performing push-ups with poor hand positioning or an uneven stance, leading to instability and compromised form.\n- Holding the peak of the push-up for extended periods, which can lead to muscle fatigue and compromise proper form.",
            "1. Step 1: Prepare your workout space by finding a flat, smooth surface, such as a yoga mat or a wooden floor, where you can comfortably perform the push-up without any obstacles or distractions.\n\n2. Step 2: Begin by getting into a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart, placing them directly under your shoulders. Keep your fingers facing forward or slightly inward, avoiding any wrist injuries.\n\n3. Step 3: Place your feet hip-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between your hands and feet. Make sure your body forms a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core muscles to maintain this position.\n\n4. Step 4: Engage your core muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine, which will help stabilize your body and prevent any arching or sagging.\n\n5. Step 5: Keep your head in a neutral position, with your ears in line with your shoulders, and avoid letting your chin drop or your head lift too high.\n\n6. Step 6: Lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body, until your chest nearly touches the floor. Avoid letting your hips sag or your back arch, and keep your body in a straight line throughout the movement.\n\n7.

            "1. Step 1: Find a quiet and flat space to practice the yoga sun salutation. It's recommended to start in a well-lit area with a smooth and non-slippery floor.\n\n2. Step 2: Begin by standing in Mountain Pose (Tadasana), which involves standing with your feet hip-width apart, with one foot slightly in front of the other. Ensure that your weight is evenly distributed on both feet.\n\n3. Step 3: Exhale deeply as you fold forward in your torso, keeping your knees slightly bent if needed. As you fold forward, aim to keep your hips, knees, and shoulders aligned in a straight line, with your weight focused in your heels. Engage your core by pulling your navel towards your spine.\n\n4. Step 4: Step back into a lunge position by bringing one foot backward. Keep your front foot pointing forward and place the heel of your back foot onto the ground.\n\n5. Step 5: Extend your arms straight, placing your hands flat on the ground in front of your front foot, directly in line with your front ankle. Keep your torso parallel to the ground as you lower your back leg until your back knee nearly touches the ground.\n\n6. Step 6: Press your palms onto the ground and lift your body, straightening your front leg and bringing your front foot forward. Transfer your weight onto your palms.\n\n7. Step 7: Bring your legs up to a high Plank position, with your arms extended and your palms remaining flat on the ground.\n\n8.

These models have been shown to be effective in generating step-by-step guides, instructions, and procedural content. The use of an LLM judge to evaluate the output is also appropriate and aligns with standard practices in evaluating text generation tasks.\n\n**Decision: No**"
