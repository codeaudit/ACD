These are areas where LLMs typically face challenges due to the need for precise, accurate, and contextually relevant information.\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is classified as \"very difficult,\" indicating that even human experts might find it challenging to provide accurate and comprehensive medical advice.\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The scoring relies on an LLM judge to validate the advice based on predefined criteria. This method assumes that the LLM judge itself can accurately assess medical advice, which might be a limitation considering the complexity of medical diagnoses.\n\nGiven these points, the fact that the LLM agent succeeded at this task is indeed noteworthy. Generating accurate and relevant medical advice is a complex task that goes beyond mere language understanding and requires significant specialized knowledge. LLMs historically struggle with tasks requiring deep domain expertise and high stakes, like medical advice.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
