(Conclusion to be proven)\n\nStep 1: From the first premise, we can derive the statement \"If a is a human, then a is mortal.\" This can be expressed as: \n\u2200x (hx \u2192 mx), where hx represents \"x is a human\" and mx represents \"x is mortal\".\n\nStep 2: Now, using the first premise, we can rewrite it in the following form:\n\u2200x \u2200y (hx \u2227 y = x \u2192 my), which is read as \"For all x and y, if x is a human and y is equal to x, then y is mortal.\"\n\nStep 3: Since we know Socrates is a human (premise 2), we can apply the statement from Step 2 to derive the following: \n\u2200y (hy \u2227 y = Socrates \u2192 my), which reads as \"For all y, if y is a human and y is equal to Socrates, then y is mortal.\"\n\nStep 4: Now, we can substitute Socrates for y in the statement from Step 3: \nhy \u2227 y = Socrates \u2192 my becomes hSocrates \u2227 Socrates = Socrates \u2192 mSocrates, which simplifies to hSocrates \u2192 mSocrates.\n\nStep 5: From Step 4, we can see that we have a conditional statement of the form \"If Socrates is a human, then Socrates is mortal.\" We know Socrates is a human (premise 2), so we can apply modus ponens to derive the conclusion.\n\nProof:\n1. \u2200x (hx \u2192 mx) (Premise)\n2. Socrates is a human (Premise)\n3. \u2200x \u2200y (hx \u2227 y = x \u2192 my) (Instance of 1)\n4. \u2200y (hy \u2227 y = Socrates \u2192 my) (Instance of 3 with x = Socrates)\n5. hSocrates \u2192 mSocrates (Instance of 4 with y = Socrates)\n6. hSocrates (Premise 2)\n7.

If the judge is robust, it can reliably assess the logical correctness and proper format of the proofs.\n   - Given the importance of precision in logical proofs, there is a risk of subtle errors going undetected or being misjudged.\n\n### Decision\n- The task is indeed complex, involving multiple steps of logical reasoning and formal proof writing.\n- Success at generating a correct and valid formal logic proof, especially considering the evaluated LLM\u2019s ability to follow detailed logical steps and notations, is noteworthy.\n- The use of an LLM judge adds a layer of uncertainty, but assuming it performed as intended, the result is still significant.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
