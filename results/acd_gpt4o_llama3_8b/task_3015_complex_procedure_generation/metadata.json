Increase the mixer speed and beat the mixture for 2 minutes, until it becomes smooth and creamy. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. 9. Bake the cakes for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean. 10. Rotate the cakes halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking. 11. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. 12. Transfer the cakes to a cooling rack to cool completely. Once the cakes are completely cool, use a serrated knife to level them, if necessary. 13. Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a thin layer of frosting or chocolate ganache on top of the cake layer. 14. Place the second cake layer on top of the first layer and frost or glaze as desired. 15. Place the third cake layer on top of the second layer and frost or glaze as desired. Make sure to use room temperature ingredients, as this will help the cakes to bake evenly. Don't overmix the batter, as this can result in a dense cake. Use high-quality cocoa powder for the best flavor. Don't overbake the cakes, as this can result in a dry cake.

They can synthesize information from various sources to create logical sequences and explanations.\n\n3. **Scoring Method**: The task is scored using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which might be prone to issues like biases or inaccuracies, but assuming it works correctly, the evaluation criteria are straightforward and within the model's capabilities.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: While the task is difficult for humans due to the need for precision and clarity, LLMs have shown they can handle such tasks relatively well, assuming they have the necessary training data.\n\nConsidering the above points, it is not surprising that an advanced LLM agent succeeded at this task.
