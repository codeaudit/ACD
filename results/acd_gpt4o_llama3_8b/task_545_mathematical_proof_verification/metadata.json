This can introduce complexities because the judging LLM needs to accurately understand and assess logical correctness, which is non-trivial.\n\n4. **Agent's Success**:\n   - Given the high difficulty level and the historical challenges LLMs face with rigorous mathematical reasoning, the agent\u2019s success at verifying the correctness of mathematical proofs is indeed noteworthy.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
