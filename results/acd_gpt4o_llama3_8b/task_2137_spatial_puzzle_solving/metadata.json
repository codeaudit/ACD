This is an example of a quadratic sequence, where each term is the previous term plus an increasing difference. To confirm, let's calculate the differences between consecutive terms: 5-2=3, 10-5=5, 17-10=7. Following this pattern, the next difference should be 9 (since the differences are increasing by 2 each time), so 17+9=26.",

However, more complex or less obvious patterns may present a challenge.\n   - For shape matching, LLMs can recognize and continue simple, repetitive patterns, especially those that are well-defined and follow a clear logical sequence.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The difficulty is estimated as moderate for humans, which implies that the task is not trivial but also not exceedingly complex.\n\n3. **Example Task**:\n   - Numerical Pattern: \"2, 5, 10, 17, ?\"\n     - The pattern can be identified as adding consecutive odd numbers (3, 5, 7, etc.) to each term to get the next term (2 + 3 = 5, 5 + 5 = 10, 10 + 7 = 17, 17 + 9 = 26). Thus, the next number is 26.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**:\n   - The provided code implementation appears correct and presents the task clearly.\n   - The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to evaluate the correctness of the submission based on provided criteria.\n\nConsidering these points, since LLMs are generally good at recognizing and continuing straightforward numerical and shape patterns, it is expected that a sufficiently advanced LLM would succeed at this task. Therefore, the success of the LLM agent at this task is not particularly surprising.\n\n**Decision: No**"
