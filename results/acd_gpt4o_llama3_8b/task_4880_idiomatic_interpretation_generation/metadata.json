This involves a deep understanding of language nuances, cultural references, and creative language generation, which are advanced capabilities for an LLM.\n\n2. **Evaluation Method**: The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to score the results introduces variability, but it is generally suitable, as LLMs can effectively evaluate language tasks, especially when provided clear criteria.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated as difficult for humans due to the need for cultural understanding and creative generation, indicating that it requires a high level of sophistication from the LLM.\n\nGiven these considerations, the agent's success on this task is noteworthy because:\n- Accurately interpreting idiomatic expressions in context demonstrates a high level of linguistic and cultural understanding.\n- Creatively generating new idioms that are relevant and clear is a complex task that tests the model's ability to innovate within language.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
