The algorithm works by maintaining a running sum of the current subarray and updating it whenever a new maximum sum is found.\n\nThe logic behind the algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Initialize `max_sum` to negative infinity and `current_sum` to 0. This is because we want to ensure that any sum we find is greater than the initial value.\n\n2. Iterate through the array. For each number, we have two choices:\n   - We can start a new subarray from this number, so we set `current_sum` to the current number.\n   - We can extend the current subarray by adding the current number to `current_sum`. We do this by taking the maximum of the current number and `current_sum + num`.\n\n3. We update `max_sum` whenever we find a greater sum than the current maximum.\n\n4. Finally, we return `max_sum`, which is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.\n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array.\n\nSpace complexity: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and the current sum.",

The idea behind this algorithm is to keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position and the maximum sum of the subarray seen so far.\n\nThe algorithm starts by initializing two variables, `max_current` and `max_global`, to the first element of the array. `max_current` stores the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position, and `max_global` stores the maximum sum of the subarray seen so far.\n\nThen, the algorithm iterates over the array starting from the second element. For each element, it calculates the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position by taking the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the previous position.\n\nIf the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position is greater than the maximum sum of the subarray seen so far, it updates `max_global` with the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.\n\nFinally, the algorithm returns `max_global`, which stores the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray.\n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, because the algorithm iterates over the array once.\n\nSpace complexity: O(1), because the algorithm uses a constant amount of space to store the `max_current` and `max_global` variables, regardless of the size of the input array.",

Initialize two variables, `max_current` and `max_global`, to store the maximum sum of the current subarray and the maximum sum of all subarrays so far, respectively.\n2.  Set `max_current` to the first element of the array and `max_global` to `max_current`.\n3.  Iterate through the array starting from the second element.\n4.

We can achieve this by using a sliding window approach combined with a dictionary to keep track of character indices.\n\n1.  **Initialization:** We start by initializing an empty dictionary `char_index_map` to store the last seen index of each character. We also initialize `max_length` to 0, which will store the maximum length of substring without repeating characters encountered so far. The `window_start` variable represents the starting index of the current window, which we initialize to 0.\n\n2.  **Sliding Window and Character Tracking:** We then iterate over the string `s` from left to right. For each character at the current `window_end` position, we check if it is already present in the `char_index_map`. If it is, it means we have encountered this character before in the string. In this case, we update `window_start` to be the maximum of its current value and the last seen index of the character plus one. This effectively moves the start of the window to the right of the previously seen index of the character.\n\n3.  **Updating the Dictionary and Maximum Length:** We then update the `char_index_map` by storing the current `window_end` as the last seen index of the character. We also update `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the current substring (i.e., `window_end - window_start + 1`).\n\n4.  **Return the Maximum Length:** Once we have processed the entire string, we return `max_length`, which now holds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are doing a single pass over the string.\n\nSpace complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string `s` and m is the size of the character set. This is because in the worst case, we might need to store all unique characters in the `char_index_map`.\n\nThis algorithm works by efficiently tracking the last seen index of each character and updating the sliding window accordingly. The use of a dictionary allows us to achieve a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs.",

The logic behind the algorithm is based on the sliding window technique, which is commonly used in string and array problems.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n1.  We initialize a set `char_set` to keep track of unique characters in the current window. We also initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the start and end of the current window, respectively.\n2.  We iterate over the string `s` using the `right` pointer. For each character, we check if it is already present in the `char_set`.\n3.  If the character is present in `char_set`, it means that there is a repeating character in the current window. In this case, we remove characters from the left of the window (i.e., `left`) until the repeating character is removed from the window.\n4.  We add the current character (`s[right]`) to `char_set` and update the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters if the current window size (`right - left + 1`) is greater than the maximum length found so far.\n5.  We repeat steps 2-4 until we have processed all characters in the string.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are doing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set (i.e., the number of unique characters in the string). This is because we are storing unique characters in the `char_set`. In the worst case, if all characters are unique, the space complexity will be O(n). However, if there are many repeating characters, the space complexity will be O(m), where m is the number of unique characters."

The idea is to maintain a map of characters and their indices in the string, and a variable `start` to represent the start of the current substring without repeating characters.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* We create an empty map `char_index_map` to store the index of each character in the string.\n* We initialize `start` to 0, which represents the start of the current substring without repeating characters.\n* We iterate over the string `s`. For each character `s[i]`, we check if it's already in the `char_index_map`. If it is, and its index is greater than or equal to `start`, it means we've found a repeating character, so we update `start` to be the index of the repeating character plus one. This is because we want to start the new substring from the next character.\n* We then update the index of `s[i]` in the `char_index_map` to be the current index `i`.\n* We calculate the length of the current substring without repeating characters by subtracting `start` from `i` and add 1, and update `max_length` if it's greater than the current `max_length`.\n* Finally, we return `max_length` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we're doing a single pass over the string.\nSpace complexity: O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set, because in the worst case, we need to store all characters in the `char_index_map`.\n\nNote: This algorithm assumes that the input string `s` only contains ASCII characters. If the string can contain non-ASCII characters, we need to modify the algorithm to use a map that can handle non-ASCII characters.",
            "Algorithm: \n```python\ndef length_of_longest_substring(s):\n    char_index_map = {}\n    max_length = 0\n    window_start = 0\n\n    for window_end in range(len(s)):\n        right_char = s[window_end]\n        if right_char in char_index_map:\n            window_start = max(window_start, char_index_map[right_char] + 1)\n        char_index_map[right_char] = window_end\n        max_length = max(max_length, window_end - window_start + 1)\n\n    return max_length\n```\n\nExplanation: \nThe goal of this problem is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. We can achieve this by using a sliding window approach combined with a dictionary to keep track of character indices.\n\n1.  **Initialization:** We start by initializing an empty dictionary `char_index_map` to store the last seen index of each character. We also initialize `max_length` to 0, which will store the maximum length of substring without repeating characters encountered so far. The `window_start` variable represents the starting index of the current window, which we initialize to 0.\n\n2.  **Sliding Window and Character Tracking:** We then iterate over the string `s` from left to right. For each character at the current `window_end` position, we check if it is already present in the `char_index_map`. If it is, it means we have encountered this character before in the string. In this case, we update `window_start` to be the maximum of its current value and the last seen index of the character plus one. This effectively moves the start of the window to the right of the previously seen index of the character.\n\n3.  **Updating the Dictionary and Maximum Length:** We then update the `char_index_map` by storing the current `window_end` as the last seen index of the character. We also update `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the current substring (i.e., `window_end - window_start + 1`).\n\n4.  **Return the Maximum Length:** Once we have processed the entire string, we return `max_length`, which now holds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nTime complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are doing a single pass over the string.\n\nSpace complexity: O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string `s` and m is the size of the character set. This is because in the worst case, we might need to store all unique characters in the `char_index_map`.\n\nThis algorithm works by efficiently tracking the last seen index of each character and updating the sliding window accordingly. The use of a dictionary allows us to achieve a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large inputs.",

The logic behind the algorithm is based on the sliding window technique, which is commonly used in string and array problems.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n1.  We initialize a set `char_set` to keep track of unique characters in the current window. We also initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the start and end of the current window, respectively.\n2.  We iterate over the string `s` using the `right` pointer. For each character, we check if it is already present in the `char_set`.\n3.  If the character is present in `char_set`, it means that there is a repeating character in the current window. In this case, we remove characters from the left of the window (i.e., `left`) until the repeating character is removed from the window.\n4.  We add the current character (`s[right]`) to `char_set` and update the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters if the current window size (`right - left + 1`) is greater than the maximum length found so far.\n5.  We repeat steps 2-4 until we have processed all characters in the string.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are doing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set (i.e., the number of unique characters in the string). This is because we are storing unique characters in the `char_set`. In the worst case, if all characters are unique, the space complexity will be O(n). However, if there are many repeating characters, the space complexity will be O(m), where m is the number of unique characters."
