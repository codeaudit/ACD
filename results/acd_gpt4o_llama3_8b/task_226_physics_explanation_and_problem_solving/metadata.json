            "1. Explanation: \n\nElectromagnetic induction is a fundamental physical phenomenon where an electric current is generated in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field. This occurs when a conductor, such as a coil, is placed within a magnetic field that is either changing in strength or direction. The changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the conductor, which in turn causes an electric current to flow through the conductor.\n\nThe phenomenon of electromagnetic induction was first discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 and is a cornerstone of electrical engineering and physics. The induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the conductor. The magnetic flux is the product of the magnetic field strength and the cross-sectional area of the conductor. The direction of the induced current is determined by Lenz's law, which states that the induced current will flow in a direction such that it opposes the change in the magnetic field.\n\nThe mathematical formulation of electromagnetic induction is based on Faraday's law of induction, which states that the induced EMF (\u03b5) is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux (\u03a6) through the conductor:\n\n\u03b5 = -d\u03a6/dt\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the induced EMF, \u03a6 is the magnetic flux, and t is time.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nGiven:\n- Number of turns (N) = 50\n- Cross-sectional area (A) = 0.1 square meters\n- Initial magnetic field strength (B1) = 0.2 Tesla\n- Final magnetic field strength (B2) = 0 Tesla\n- Time (t) = 0.5 seconds\n\nWe need to calculate the induced EMF (\u03b5) in the coil.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the magnetic flux (\u03a6) at the initial and final times.\n\n\u03a6 = N \u00d7 A \u00d7 B\n\nFor the initial time (t = 0):\n\u03a61 = N \u00d7 A \u00d7 B1\n= 50 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0.2\n= 1 Tesla\u00b7m\u00b2\n\nFor the final time (t = 0.5):\n\u03a62 = N \u00d7 A \u00d7 B2\n= 50 \u00d7 0.1 \u00d7 0\n= 0 Tesla\u00b7m\u00b2\n\nStep 2: Calculate the change in magnetic flux (\u0394\u03a6) over the time period (t).\n\n\u0394\u03a6 = \u03a62 - \u03a61\n= 0 - 1\n= -1 Tesla\u00b7m\u00b2\n\nStep 3: Calculate the rate of change of the magnetic flux (d\u03a6/dt) using the change in magnetic flux (\u0394\u03a6) and the time period (t).\n\nd\u03a6/dt = \u0394\u03a6 / t\n= -1 / 0.5\n= -2 Tesla\u00b7m\u00b2/s\n\nStep 4: Apply Faraday's law of induction to calculate the induced EMF (\u03b5).\n\n\u03b5 = -d\u03a6/dt\n= -(-2)\n= 2 Volts\n\nTherefore, the induced EMF in the coil is 2 Volts.",
            "1. Explanation: \nElectromagnetic induction is a fundamental phenomenon in physics where a changing magnetic field induces an electric field in a conductor. This occurs due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the conductor's motion or the changing magnetic field itself. The process involves the generation of an electromotive force (EMF) in the conductor, which can drive an electric current if the circuit is closed. \n\nThe key principles involved in electromagnetic induction include Faraday's law of induction, which states that the magnitude of the induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the conductor. Mathematically, this is expressed as \u03b5 = -N(d\u03a6/dt), where \u03b5 is the induced EMF, N is the number of turns of the coil, \u03a6 is the magnetic flux, and t is time. The negative sign indicates that the direction of the induced EMF is such that it opposes the change in the magnetic flux.\n\nAnother crucial concept is the magnetic flux \u03a6, which is the dot product of the magnetic field B and the area vector A of the conductor. For a coil with a cross-sectional area A and placed in a magnetic field B, the magnetic flux is given by \u03a6 = BA.\n\nGiven the changing magnetic field from 0.2 Tesla to 0 Tesla in 0.5 seconds, the rate of change of the magnetic field is (0 - 0.2) / 0.5 = -0.4 Tesla per second.\n\n2.

            "1. Explanation: Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the dual nature of particles, such as electrons, exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like properties. Historically, scientists believed that particles, like electrons, were solely particles, whereas waves were observed as undulating disturbances in a medium. However, experiments showed that particles, like electrons, can exhibit wave-like properties, such as diffraction and interference. Conversely, waves can also exhibit particle-like properties, such as having a definite position and momentum. This seeming contradiction between the two opposing views led to the development of wave-particle duality. The concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, where classical notions of particle and wave properties are insufficient to explain observed phenomena. In essence, wave-particle duality states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength, a concept derived from wave-particle duality, relates the wavelength of a particle to its momentum. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that particles, such as electrons, exhibit wave-like properties, and their wavelength (\u03bb) can be calculated using the formula \u03bb = h / p, where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum of the particle. This concept revolutionized the understanding of particle behavior and laid the foundation for wave mechanics in quantum physics.\n\n2.

This phenomenon was first observed by Louis de Broglie in 1924, who proposed that particles, such as electrons, could exhibit wave-like properties, including diffraction and interference.\n\nThe wave-particle duality of electrons is a result of the quantization of energy and the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with infinite precision. This means that electrons can exhibit wave-like behavior, such as diffraction and interference, when their momentum is uncertain.\n\nThe wave-particle duality of electrons can be demonstrated through various experiments, such as the double-slit experiment, where electrons passing through two parallel slits create an interference pattern on a screen, indicating wave-like behavior. However, when observed individually, electrons behave like particles, exhibiting particle-like properties such as having a definite position and momentum.\n\nThe concept of wave-particle duality has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level, and has led to significant advances in fields such as quantum mechanics, particle physics, and materials science.\n\n2.

Problem Solution:\n\nTo calculate the induced EMF in the coil, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial and final magnetic flux through the coil.\n\nThe initial magnetic flux (\u03a6i) is given by the product of the initial magnetic field strength (Bi) and the cross-sectional area (A) of the coil: \u03a6i = Bi \u00d7 A = 0.2 Tesla \u00d7 0.1 m\u00b2 = 0.02 Wb.\n\nThe final magnetic flux (\u03a6f) is given by the product of the final magnetic field strength (Bf) and the cross-sectional area (A) of the coil: \u03a6f = Bf \u00d7 A = 0 Tesla \u00d7 0.1 m\u00b2 = 0 Wb.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the change in magnetic flux (\u0394\u03a6).\n\nThe change in magnetic flux (\u0394\u03a6) is the difference between the final and initial magnetic flux: \u0394\u03a6 = \u03a6f - \u03a6i = 0 Wb - 0.02 Wb = -0.02 Wb.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the rate of change of magnetic flux (d\u03a6/dt).\n\nThe rate of change of magnetic flux (d\u03a6/dt) is given by the change in magnetic flux (\u0394\u03a6) divided by the time (\u0394t) over which it changes: d\u03a6/dt = \u0394\u03a6 / \u0394t = -0.02 Wb / 0.5 s = -0.04 Wb/s.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the induced EMF (\u03b5) using Faraday's law of induction.\n\nThe induced EMF (\u03b5) is given by the product of the rate of change of magnetic flux (d\u03a6/dt) and the number of turns (N) of the coil: \u03b5 = -N(d\u03a6/dt) = -50 \u00d7 (-0.04 Wb/s) = 2 V.\n\nTherefore, the induced EMF in the coil is 2 volts."

            "1. Explanation: Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the dual nature of particles, such as electrons, exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like properties. Historically, scientists believed that particles, like electrons, were solely particles, whereas waves were observed as undulating disturbances in a medium. However, experiments showed that particles, like electrons, can exhibit wave-like properties, such as diffraction and interference. Conversely, waves can also exhibit particle-like properties, such as having a definite position and momentum. This seeming contradiction between the two opposing views led to the development of wave-particle duality. The concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level, where classical notions of particle and wave properties are insufficient to explain observed phenomena. In essence, wave-particle duality states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior depending on how they are observed.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength, a concept derived from wave-particle duality, relates the wavelength of a particle to its momentum. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that particles, such as electrons, exhibit wave-like properties, and their wavelength (\u03bb) can be calculated using the formula \u03bb = h / p, where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum of the particle. This concept revolutionized the understanding of particle behavior and laid the foundation for wave mechanics in quantum physics.\n\n2. Problem Solution:\n\nTo solve for the de Broglie wavelength of an electron traveling at a speed of 2 x 10^6 meters per second, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the given parameters.\n- Speed of the electron (v) = 2 x 10^6 m/s\n- Planck's constant (h) = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s\n- Mass of the electron (m) = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg\n\nStep 2: Calculate the momentum of the electron using the formula p = mv.\np = m * v\np = (9.109 x 10^-31 kg) * (2 x 10^6 m/s)\np = 1.8218 x 10^-24 kg m/s\n\nStep 3: Use the de Broglie wavelength formula to find the wavelength: \u03bb = h / p.\n\u03bb = h / p\n\u03bb = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) / (1.8218 x 10^-24 kg m/s)\n\u03bb = 3.633 x 10^-10 m\n\nTherefore, the de Broglie wavelength of the electron traveling at 2 x 10^6 meters per second is approximately 3.633 x 10^-10 meters.",

This phenomenon was first observed by Louis de Broglie in 1924, who proposed that particles, such as electrons, could exhibit wave-like properties, including diffraction and interference.\n\nThe wave-particle duality of electrons is a result of the quantization of energy and the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with infinite precision. This means that electrons can exhibit wave-like behavior, such as diffraction and interference, when their momentum is uncertain.\n\nThe wave-particle duality of electrons can be demonstrated through various experiments, such as the double-slit experiment, where electrons passing through two parallel slits create an interference pattern on a screen, indicating wave-like behavior. However, when observed individually, electrons behave like particles, exhibiting particle-like properties such as having a definite position and momentum.\n\nThe concept of wave-particle duality has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level, and has led to significant advances in fields such as quantum mechanics, particle physics, and materials science.\n\n2.

Explanation:\nWave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the dual nature of particles, such as electrons, which can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed. In some experiments, electrons behave as waves, displaying characteristics like diffraction, interference, and superposition, whereas in other experiments, they exhibit particle-like behavior, such as having definite positions and trajectories.\n\nThis duality is a result of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that it is impossible to know both the exact position and momentum of a particle at the same time. At the atomic and subatomic level, the behavior of particles is governed by wave functions, which describe the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space.\n\nIn the context of electrons, the wave-particle duality is most strikingly demonstrated in the double-slit experiment. When a beam of electrons passes through two parallel slits, creating a diffraction pattern on a screen behind the slits, it exhibits wave-like behavior. However, when observed individually, electrons behave like particles, creating two distinct beams on the screen. This experiment highlights the probabilistic nature of particle behavior at the subatomic level.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength is a fundamental concept related to wave-particle duality, which describes the wavelength associated with a particle, such as an electron. Louis de Broglie proposed that particles have a wave-like nature, and the wavelength of the wave is inversely proportional to the particle's momentum. Mathematically, the de Broglie wavelength (\u03bb) is given by the equation:\n\n\u03bb = h / p\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) and p is the momentum of the particle (p = mv, where m is the mass of the particle and v is its velocity).\n\n2.

However, when the particle is observed or measured, it behaves like a particle, exhibiting particle-like properties such as having a definite position and momentum.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength is a key concept in understanding wave-particle duality.
