            "Turn 1: Gather\nRationale: The best starting point to maximize initial resource collection with the lowest risk of investing time and resources into potential 'Build' structures and the absence of penalties on 'Rest'.\nOutcome: Collected 2 resources, currently at 2 units.\n\nTurn 2: Build\nRationale: This is the next best move after 'Gather', as 'Build' sets up the maximum resource gathering potential for 'Gather' in turn 3. This means resources can be collected from 'Gather' plus doubled due to the current 'Build'.\nOutcome: The effect of 'Build' won't be in play yet, but set to become effective in Turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: Gather\nRationale: Since 'Build' from Turn 2 hasn't yet doubled gathering from the next 'Gather', we must accumulate as much as possible immediately to increase our total prior to doubling in the turn following this action.\nOutcome: Collected 4 resources (2 from doubling effect due to 'Build' that started in previous turn).\n\nTurn 4: Gather\nRationale: Following the same sequence of optimizing initial collection at full strength, this enables a better starting point if there are any issues like 'Rest' in coming turns that might cause backtracking on the total needed to be at 10.\nOutcome: Collected 6 resources (once again with doubling effect thanks to the 'Build').\n\nTurn 5: Gather\nRationale: As per the plan already in progress, to remain at an optimal collection. If successful, we just need 4 more resource units. The goal right now is to stay maximally resourceful to easily surpass 10.\nOutcome: Collected 2 resources from the doubled efficiency, but without doubling so just collected 2 which, in addition to this and other previous resource collects, places us at over 12 units of gathered resources in total.\n\nAdditional consideration given to 'Build' effectiveness, which did indeed occur and increased collections but ultimately led to finishing well before the target needed was hit, indicating building the maximum possible structures each time you have the right chance (i.e. building 2 in maximum in your first two and 2 more if another build in a following play isn't used) increases resource gain potential in more aggressive or fast-paced circumstances where immediate progress is being prioritized.",

These are high-level cognitive functions that are challenging even for sophisticated models.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is marked as \"difficult\" for humans, indicating that it involves multiple layers of decision-making and prediction of future states based on current actions.\n\n3. **Nature of the Task**: The task is sequential and requires the model to keep track of past actions and their consequences while making decisions for future actions. This involves a level of memory and consistency that can be challenging for LLMs.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated using an LLM judge, which can be both a strength and a weakness. While the LLM judge might understand the logical flow of actions, it might not perfectly capture the intricacies of strategic decision-making as a human expert would.\n\nGiven these considerations, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it would indicate a noteworthy achievement because:\n\n1. LLMs are generally better at tasks requiring pattern recognition and generation rather than complex decision-making over multiple steps.\n2. The task's difficulty and the requirement for strategic planning make it a significant challenge, highlighting advanced capabilities if successfully completed.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
