Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n**Notes:**\n- To achieve a crispy crust, make sure the oven is preheated to the correct temperature and the pizza is baked for the right amount of time.\n- Use high-quality ingredients, such as fresh mozzarella and basil, to get the best flavor out of your margherita pizza.\n- If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a baking sheet, but the crust might not turn out as crispy.",
            "Here is the recipe for a classic margherita pizza:\n\n**Classic Margherita Pizza Recipe**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 cups warm water\n- 2 tsp active dry yeast\n- 3 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 4 cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 cup San Marzano tomatoes, crushed\n- 8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced\n- Fresh basil leaves, chopped\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until the yeast is activated and foamy.\n2. Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the bowl. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.\n3. Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour, one cup at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. You may not need all of the remaining flour, so add it gradually and be prepared to stop adding flour when the dough feels right.\n4. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.\n5. Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) with a baking stone or baking sheet inside. Punch down the dough and shape it into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper or a lightly floured pizza peel if you have one.\n6. Spread the crushed San Marzano tomatoes over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange the sliced mozzarella cheese on top of the tomatoes.\n7. Season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Slide the parchment paper or pizza peel onto the preheated baking stone or baking sheet.\n8. Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n\n**Notes:**\n- Use high-quality ingredients, such as San Marzano tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese, to get the best flavor out of your pizza.\n- If you don't have a baking stone or baking sheet, you can bake the pizza on a regular oven rack. Just make sure to rotate the pizza halfway through the baking time to ensure even cooking.\n- Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. This will help the cheese set and the flavors meld together.",
