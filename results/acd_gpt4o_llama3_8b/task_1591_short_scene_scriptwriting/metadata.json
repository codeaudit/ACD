            "INT. SMALL CAF\u00c9 - EVENING\n\nThe caf\u00e9 is dimly lit, with soft jazz music playing in the background. The air is thick with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and baked goods. Alice and Bob sit at a small table by the window, their faces illuminated by the faint light of the setting sun outside.\n\nAlice fidgets with her cup, her eyes fixed intently on Bob. She looks like she's been rehearsing this conversation in her head for hours.\n\nBOB: (nervously) What's going on, Alice?\n\nALICE: (her voice barely above a whisper) Don't play dumb, Bob. I know about the job offer.\n\nBOB: (hesitating) How did you find out?\n\nALICE: (skeptical) You think I'm that oblivious? I've seen the way you've been acting lately. The sudden interest in your appearance, the way you've been talking about new opportunities... It all added up.\n\nBob looks sheepish, his eyes darting around the caf\u00e9 as if searching for an escape route.\n\nBOB: (defensive) You don't understand, Alice. This is a huge opportunity for me. A chance to advance my career and provide for us in a way that I couldn't before.\n\nALICE: (bitter) Provide for us? You mean, without actually doing any real work? This job offer is just another way for you to avoid taking responsibility for your actions.\n\nBob's face darkens, and for a moment, it seems like he's going to lunge at Alice. But then, his expression softens, and he takes a deep breath.\n\nBOB: (calmly) I know this isn't easy for you to hear, Alice. But I'm doing this for us. For our future.\n\nALICE: (tearfully) Our future? You have no idea what our future looks like. You've been so focused on your own ambitions that you've forgotten what's truly important.\n\nThe conversation hangs in the air like a challenge, the tension between Alice and Bob palpable. The jazz music continues to play, but it's no longer soothing. Instead, it's a harsh reminder of the distance growing between them.\n\nFADE TO BLACK."

I know it's not the right time, and I don't want to ruin our friendship... but I had to be honest with you.\n\nSarah's expression changes from curiosity to surprise, and she looks away, her eyes scanning the surrounding area.\n\nSARAH: (her voice soft) John, I... I care about you too. But I didn't realize you felt that way.\n\nJOHN: (nodding) I know it's a lot to take in. But I had to be honest with you. I don't want to keep pretending like everything is fine when it's not.\n\nSarah turns back to John, a mix of emotions on her face. She reaches out and gently places her hand on his arm.\n\nSARAH: (smiling softly) I appreciate your honesty, John. And I care about you too. But we need to talk about this more. Can we... take some time to figure things out?\n\nJOHN: (nodding, relief washing over his face) Yeah, that sounds good.

John and Sarah sit on a weathered park bench, their legs touching as they gaze out at the scenery.\n\nSARAH, a bright and cheerful young woman with blonde hair, leans her head against John's shoulder. John, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s with a scar above his left eyebrow, wraps a protective arm around her.\n\nJOHN\n(sighs, his expression nostalgic)\nYou know, I used to come to this park all the time when I was a kid. My parents would bring me here on Sundays.\n\nSARAH\n(smiling)\nThat's so sweet. What's the story?\n\nJOHN\n(chuckles)\nMy mom would pack a picnic, and we'd sit on this exact bench. I'd tell her about my day, and she'd listen with this... this spark in her eyes.

I mean, revealing your feelings to me here, in the park.\n\nJOHN\n(taking a deep breath)\nIt's just... I wanted to find a place where we can talk without any distractions.
