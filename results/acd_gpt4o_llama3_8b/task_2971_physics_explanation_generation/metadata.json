            "Explanation: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance to slow down the objects. According to the principle of equivalence, also known as the equivalence principle, the acceleration due to gravity is constant for all objects regardless of their mass. This principle states that the effects of gravity on an object are independent of its mass. As a result, the force of gravity acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass, but the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects. Therefore, objects of different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum, as the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, and the effects of gravity are independent of their mass.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, objects of different masses fall at the same rate due to the absence of air resistance. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force of gravity acting on an object is proportional to its mass (F = mg), but the acceleration due to gravity (g) is independent of the object's mass. Since the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass, they fall at the same rate in a vacuum. This phenomenon is often demonstrated in a controlled environment, such as a drop tower or a space station, where objects of varying masses are dropped and observed to fall at the same rate.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance or friction to slow down the objects or exert an upward force on them. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma). The force of gravity acting on an object is given by its mass times the acceleration due to gravity (F = mg). Since the acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant and independent of the object's mass, the force of gravity acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass. However, in a vacuum, the acceleration of an object is determined by the net force acting on it, which in this case is just the force of gravity. Since the force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object, it might seem that heavier objects would fall faster. But, according to the principle of equivalence, all objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum, regardless of their mass. This is because the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, and the force of gravity acting on an object is balanced by the object's inertia, which is directly proportional to its mass. As a result, the acceleration of an object in a vacuum is independent of its mass, and objects of different masses fall at the same rate.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance or drag to slow down the objects as they fall. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force of gravity acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). However, in a vacuum, the force of gravity acting on all objects is the same, regardless of their mass. This is because the force of gravity is a universal force that acts on all objects with mass, and it does not depend on the mass of the object. Since the force of gravity is the same for all objects, and the acceleration due to gravity is constant, objects of different masses will fall at the same rate in a vacuum. This is also consistent with the principle of equivalence, which states that all objects fall at the same rate in a uniform gravitational field, regardless of their mass.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, the primary factor influencing the fall of objects is the acceleration due to gravity, which is a fundamental force of nature. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. This force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. However, in a vacuum, air resistance is eliminated, which is a major factor affecting the fall of objects on Earth. With air resistance eliminated, the only force acting on the objects is the gravitational force. According to Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on an object, m is its mass, and a is the acceleration produced. Since the gravitational force acting on the objects is directly proportional to their mass (F \u221d m), the acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant for all objects regardless of their mass. Therefore, objects of different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum, as the acceleration due to gravity is the dominant force acting on them."

            "Explanation: A rainbow is formed through a process called refraction and dispersion of light. It occurs when sunlight passes through water droplets in the air, typically after a rain shower or near a waterfall or mist. The sunlight is refracted, or bent, as it enters the water droplets, and is split into its individual colors, a process known as dispersion. This is due to the different wavelengths of light being refracted at slightly different angles, causing the colors to spread out and separate from each other. The angles at which the light is refracted depend on the speed of light in the water and air, which is related to the wavelength of the light. The dispersed light is then reflected off the back of the water droplet and exits the droplet at a different angle, creating the colors of the rainbow that we see. The colors always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, which is because the longer wavelengths (red and orange) are bent less than the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet). This phenomenon can be explained by the principles of refraction, dispersion, and the behavior of light as it passes from one medium to another.",
            "Explanation: A rainbow is a spectacular display of colors that appears in the sky after a rain shower or when sunlight passes through mist or fog. The formation of a rainbow is a result of a phenomenon called refraction, which is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different optical density. In the case of a rainbow, sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and is refracted, or bent, as it passes through the water droplets in the air. The light is split into its individual colors, which we perceive as the colors of the rainbow, due to a process called dispersion. Dispersion occurs because each color of light has a slightly different wavelength and is refracted at a slightly different angle. As the light is refracted, it is also reflected off the back of the water droplet and then exits the droplet at a different angle, creating the arc of color that we see as a rainbow. The position of the rainbow in the sky is determined by the angle at which the sunlight passes through the water droplets and the observer's position. The angle of the rainbow is always 42 degrees, measured from the direction of the sunlight. The colors of the rainbow always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, which is often remembered using the acronym ROYGBIV. This stunning visual display is a result of the interaction between sunlight, water droplets, and the laws of physics that govern the behavior of light.",
            "Explanation: A rainbow is formed through a phenomenon known as refraction and dispersion of light. It occurs when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and passes through water droplets in the air, such as after a rain shower or near a waterfall. As sunlight enters a water droplet, it encounters a boundary between air and water, causing the light to bend, or refract. The different colors of the light have varying wavelengths, and since they bend at slightly different angles, the light is split into its individual colors, a process known as dispersion. The dispersed light is then reflected off the back of the water droplet and exits the droplet, bending again as it enters the air. This bending of light creates the colors of the rainbow, with red light being bent the least and violet light being bent the most. As the light exits the water droplet, it spreads out and forms the colorful arc of a rainbow that we see in the sky.",
            "Explanation: A rainbow is formed through a process called refraction, which is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another.

This second refraction bends the light back towards the observer, creating the arc shape of a rainbow. The colors always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, which is because the wavelengths of these colors are spread out in that order due to dispersion. The position of the rainbow in the sky is determined by the position of the sun and the observer, with the sun being behind the observer and the water droplets in the air in front of them."

            "Explanation: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance to slow down the objects. According to the principle of equivalence, also known as the equivalence principle, the acceleration due to gravity is constant for all objects regardless of their mass. This principle states that the effects of gravity on an object are independent of its mass. As a result, the force of gravity acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass, but the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects. Therefore, objects of different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum, as the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, and the effects of gravity are independent of their mass.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, objects of different masses fall at the same rate due to the absence of air resistance. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force of gravity acting on an object is proportional to its mass (F = mg), but the acceleration due to gravity (g) is independent of the object's mass. Since the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass, they fall at the same rate in a vacuum. This phenomenon is often demonstrated in a controlled environment, such as a drop tower or a space station, where objects of varying masses are dropped and observed to fall at the same rate.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance or friction to slow down the objects or exert an upward force on them. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration (F = ma). The force of gravity acting on an object is given by its mass times the acceleration due to gravity (F = mg). Since the acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant and independent of the object's mass, the force of gravity acting on an object is directly proportional to its mass. However, in a vacuum, the acceleration of an object is determined by the net force acting on it, which in this case is just the force of gravity. Since the force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the object, it might seem that heavier objects would fall faster. But, according to the principle of equivalence, all objects fall at the same rate in a vacuum, regardless of their mass. This is because the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, and the force of gravity acting on an object is balanced by the object's inertia, which is directly proportional to its mass. As a result, the acceleration of an object in a vacuum is independent of its mass, and objects of different masses fall at the same rate.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, there is no air resistance or drag to slow down the objects as they fall. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force of gravity acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). However, in a vacuum, the force of gravity acting on all objects is the same, regardless of their mass. This is because the force of gravity is a universal force that acts on all objects with mass, and it does not depend on the mass of the object. Since the force of gravity is the same for all objects, and the acceleration due to gravity is constant, objects of different masses will fall at the same rate in a vacuum. This is also consistent with the principle of equivalence, which states that all objects fall at the same rate in a uniform gravitational field, regardless of their mass.",
            "Explanation: In a vacuum, the primary factor influencing the fall of objects is the acceleration due to gravity, which is a fundamental force of nature. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. This force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. However, in a vacuum, air resistance is eliminated, which is a major factor affecting the fall of objects on Earth. With air resistance eliminated, the only force acting on the objects is the gravitational force. According to Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on an object, m is its mass, and a is the acceleration produced. Since the gravitational force acting on the objects is directly proportional to their mass (F \u221d m), the acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant for all objects regardless of their mass. Therefore, objects of different masses fall at the same rate in a vacuum, as the acceleration due to gravity is the dominant force acting on them."
