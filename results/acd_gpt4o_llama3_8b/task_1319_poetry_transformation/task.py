Haiku: A traditional Japanese three-line poem with a syllable pattern of 5-7-5. Example:
An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pondâ€”
Splash! Silence again.

Limerick: A five-line poem with a rhyme scheme of AABBA and a specific rhythm pattern. Example:
There once was a man from Peru
Who dreamed he was eating his shoe
He awoke with a fright
In the middle of the night
To find that his dream had come true.

Submit your transformed poem as a plain text string."""
