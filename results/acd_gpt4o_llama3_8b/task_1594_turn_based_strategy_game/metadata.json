Most of the previous tasks focused on creativity, reasoning, problem-solving, interdisciplinary knowledge, and empathy. One area that hasn't been extensively tested is the LLM's ability to handle real-time decision-making and strategy, particularly within game-like scenarios. This can reveal how well the model can understand rules, anticipate outcomes, and make strategic decisions based on dynamic contexts.\n\nI propose creating a task family where the LLM needs to play a turn-based strategy game.

However, I don't have any information about the current game state, such as the positions of the pieces on the board.\n\nLet's assume a generic game state where the player to move is White, and we'll consider a few possible scenarios to illustrate the thought process.\n\n**Scenario 1: Opening position**\n\n* The board is empty except for the starting positions of the pieces.\n* The player to move (White) has the King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn in their starting positions.\n\nIn this scenario, the best move for White would be to develop their pieces and control the center of the board.

            "content": "Given the task family \"turn_based_strategy_game,\" the following factors need to be considered:\n\n1. **Capabilities of LLMs**: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance in natural language understanding, generating text, and even solving logical problems to some extent. However, their ability to perform well in structured tasks that require precise logical reasoning and strategic thinking, like playing chess, is more challenging.\n\n2. **Task Complexity**: Chess is a complex game with well-defined rules but requires a high level of strategic thinking and foresight. Success in making optimal moves in chess indicates a significant understanding of the game's mechanics and strategic depth.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which means the scoring relies on another LLM to judge the correctness and optimality of the moves. While this can be useful, it can also introduce biases or errors if the evaluating LLM does not possess a deep understanding of chess.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is \"moderate,\" suggesting that a human with some knowledge of chess would be able to perform this task. However, achieving optimal moves consistently requires a higher level of skill.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of an LLM in making optimal moves in a turn-based strategy game like chess is noteworthy. It reflects a degree of logical reasoning and strategic planning beyond simple text generation or basic logical tasks.\n\nDecision: Yes"
