Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Task Complexity**: The task involves pattern recognition and logical extension, which are generally straightforward for LLMs when presented in a textual format, particularly if the pattern is simple and repetitive.\n\n2. **Example Task**: The provided pattern is \"circle, square, triangle, circle, square, triangle, circle, ?\" and the expected answer is \"square.\" This pattern is simple and follows a clear repetitive sequence.\n\n3. **LLM Capability**: Modern LLMs, including the one being evaluated, are typically proficient at recognizing and extending simple repetitive patterns, even those involving visual elements like shapes, as long as they are described textually.\n\n4. **Scoring Method**: The scoring method involves an LLM judge which matches the provided answer with the expected answer (\"square\"). Given that the pattern is straightforward, it is reasonable to expect the LLM to succeed.\n\n5. **Human Difficulty**: While the task is estimated as difficult for humans, it typically refers to more complex patterns or those requiring deep visual-spatial reasoning. The given example does not seem to fall into that category.\n\nBased on these considerations, the success of the LLM on this specific task (recognizing and extending a simple repetitive pattern) is not surprising. \n\nDecision: No"
