I will also add a note in the instructions to specify that the solutions should be optimal and lead to a checkmate or significant advantage efficiently.\n\nRESPONSE JSON:\n```json\n{\n    \"name_of_task\": \"chess_puzzle_solver\",\n    \"description_of_task\": \"Solve given chess puzzles and provide the sequence of moves leading to checkmate or a significant advantage.\",\n    \"capability_being_measured\": \"game theory, problem-solving, spatial reasoning\",\n    \"estimated_human_difficulty\": \"4\",\n    \"done\": \"True\",\n    \"task_family\": \"class TaskFamily:\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:\\n        return {\\n            \\\"1\\\": {\\\"board\\\": \\\"r4rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/q1p5/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 1\\\", \\\"solution\\\": \\\"Nxe5 dxe5 Bxc6\\\"},\\n            \\\"2\\\": {\\\"board\\\": \\\"r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1\\\", \\\"solution\\\": \\\"Nc6 d4 d5 exd5\\\"}\\n        }\\n\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:\\n        return f\\\"\\\"\\\"Your task is to solve the following chess puzzle.

            "To solve this chess puzzle, we first analyze the position and look for tactics, such as checks, captures, and threats. The position is given in FEN: `r4rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/q1p5/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 1`.\n\nHere, it's White's turn to move. We need to identify the best possible sequence of moves to achieve a checkmate or a significant advantage.\n\n1. White can consider the move 1. Nd5, attacking the queen on a5 and threatening to capture on e7 next, which would fork the king and the rook.\n2. If Black responds with 1... Nxd5, then White can play 2. cxd5, opening up the center and increasing control.\n3. Another option would be to look for a more direct approach. Moving 1. Bh6 seems promising, as it threatens to capture on g7 and can lead to a quick checkmate if Black is not careful.\n\nLet's consider the move 1. Bh6:\n1. Bh6 Bxh6 (forced, as otherwise, White captures on g7 with a check)\n2. Qxh6, now the threat is Qg7#.\n\nThe best Black can do is to defend against this immediate threat, but White has a significant advantage. To ensure the solution is optimal, let\u2019s validate it:\n\n1. Bh6 Bxh6 2. Qxh6, Black has to defend against Qg7#.\nThe possible moves are:\n- 2... Rfe8 (giving some breathing room)\n- 2... Qd8 (preparing to block on f6)\n\nA critical follow-up would be:\n3. Ng5, attacking f6 with a potential checkmate threat.\n\nAnswer: 1. Bh6 Bxh6 2. Qxh6 Rfe8 3. Ng5",
            "The given FEN represents a position where it is White's turn to move. Let's analyze the position to find the best possible sequence of moves leading to a checkmate or significant advantage.\n\n**Position analysis:**\n\n- White has a strong center and development, while Black's king is relatively exposed.\n- White's pieces are well-coordinated, allowing for potential tactical opportunities.\n\nLet's look for tactical opportunities, particularly targeting the exposed position of Black's king.\n\n**Move sequence:**\n\n1. Bg5 (Attacks the knight on f6, pinning it to the queen.)\n2. ... h6 (Black attempts to drive away the bishop.)\n3. Bxf6 (White captures the knight, opening up lines towards the Black king.)\n4. ... Bxf6 (Black recaptures the bishop.)\n5. Qd2 (Preparing to double rooks on the d-file and eyeing the h6 pawn.)\n6. ... Kg7 (Black tries to defend the g6 pawn and unpin the knight.)\n7. Nd5 (White attacks the queen and gains a strong position.)\n8. ... Qxd2 (Black is forced to exchange queens.)\n9. Nxd2 (White recaptures with the knight, maintaining a strong position.)\n\nWhite has gained a significant positional advantage, and Black's position falls apart rapidly. White's pieces are more active, and Black's king remains exposed.\n\nAnswer: Bg5 h6 Bxf6 Bxf6 Qd2 Kg7 Nd5 Qxd2 Nxd2",
            "The given FEN represents a chess position where it is White's turn to move. To solve this puzzle, we need to look for moves that either lead to checkmate or provide a significant advantage for White.\n\nLet's analyze the position:\n\n- White has a potential to put pressure on Black's position.\n- The Black king is on g8 and the rook on f8.\n- White's bishop on g2 can exert pressure on the king-side.\n\nHere are the moves that will lead to a significant advantage for White:\n\n1. White can play 1. Rb1, threatening the queen on a5 and aiming to open up the b-file for the rook.\n2. If Black responds with Qxc3, White can play 2. Bd2, attacking the queen and preparing to move the rook to b3 or to double rooks on the b-file.\n\nFrom this analysis, the sequence of moves that leads to a significant advantage is:\n\n1.

The black king is on g8, and the white pieces are well-positioned to launch an attack.\n2. White's queen and bishop are well-placed to exploit the weak dark squares around the black king.\n3. The black queen on a5 is somewhat out of play and cannot easily come to the defense.\n4. White can immediately threaten the black king by playing the bishop to h6, attacking the knight on g7 and threatening checkmate.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Bh6 \u2013 threatening to take the knight on g7 and deliver checkmate with Qg7#.\n2. If Black moves the knight, then White has Qg7# directly.\n3. If Black plays Bxh6, then White can play Qxh6, threatening checkmate with Qg7# or Qh8#.\n\nTherefore, Black must respond to 1. Bh6.\n\nPossible defenses for Black:\n- gxh6 (loses the knight and opens up the g-file for White\u2019s rook)\n- Bxh6 (loses a bishop and still faces a strong attack)\n- Re8 or Rfd8 (loses material after Bxg7)\n- Any other move allows immediate Qg7# or a strong follow-up attack.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best sequence of moves for White is:\n\n1. Bh6 Bxh6\n2. Qxh6\n\nAt this point, White threatens Qg7# and has a significant material and positional advantage.\n\nAnswer: Bh6 Bxh6 Qxh6",

The optimal sequence of moves is:\n\n1. Bd2\n2. Nd5\n\nLet's analyze the moves:\n\n1. Bd2: This move attacks the queen on a5 and also prepares to potentially place a rook on b1 in the future.

Analyze the position:\n   - The white pawn on d4 has advanced two squares, which can be captured en passant by the black pawn on e5.\n   - Black's knight on a6 can move to c7 or b8, but these moves do not immediately offer a significant advantage.\n   - Other pieces need to be considered for potential moves.\n\n2. Consider possible moves:\n   - The most striking move is the en passant capture: d4xd3 en passant.\n   - This move opens up lines for the Black queen and bishop, potentially leading to an attack on White's position.\n\n3. Evaluate the resulting position:\n   - After 1... exd3, White will have to respond, likely capturing back with the c-pawn or another piece, which might give Black an opportunity to develop or attack further.\n\n4.

Black has not yet developed any pieces.\n\nGiven the current state, we need to find a move that puts significant pressure on White or leads to a material advantage. Let's consider the moves:\n\n1. The pawn on d4 is a central pawn and often a target. Black could consider attacking it directly.\n2.

Possible responses include capturing the pawn on e5 (dxe5) or advancing the pawn (d5). Let's analyze both:\n\n- If 2. dxe5, then Black can recapture with the knight: 2...
