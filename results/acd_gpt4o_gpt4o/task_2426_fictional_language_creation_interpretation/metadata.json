These tasks are quite sophisticated and demand a deep understanding of language structure and semantics.\n\n2. **Expected LLM Capabilities**: Modern advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are known to exhibit strong capabilities in generating coherent and creative text. They can handle linguistic tasks well, including creating novel content based on constraints.\n\n3. **Evaluation via LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the task. This implies that another LLM evaluates the agent's output against specific criteria. Given the complex nature of the task, the accuracy of this evaluation method could vary, but generally, LLM judges can reasonably assess such outputs.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the task is challenging, it falls within the realm of what modern LLMs are expected to handle effectively. Therefore, an LLM succeeding at this task is impressive but not necessarily surprising to an expert in the field.\n\n**Decision: No**"
