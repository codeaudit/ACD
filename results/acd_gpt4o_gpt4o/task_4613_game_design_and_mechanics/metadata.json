Overview of the Game's Objective:\n   The game's objective is for players to work together as a team of astronauts to explore a distant galaxy, manage limited resources, and make groundbreaking discoveries. The team wins by successfully discovering and documenting three unique alien civilizations before their resources are depleted.\n\n2. Detailed Game Rules and Mechanics:\n   - **Setup**: \n     - The game board represents a galaxy with various planets and space anomalies. Players place their spaceship at the starting point on the board.\n     - Each player chooses a role (e.g., Engineer, Scientist, Pilot, Medic) with unique abilities.\n     - Players receive a set of resource tokens (Fuel, Food, Oxygen, Research Points).\n\n   - **Turn Structure**:\n     - On each turn, players perform actions such as moving the spaceship, collecting resources, conducting research, or repairing the spaceship.\n     - Actions cost resources. For example, moving the spaceship costs Fuel, and conducting research costs Research Points.\n     - Players draw an event card at the end of their turn, which may present challenges (e.g., asteroid fields, alien encounters) or opportunities (e.g., resource caches).\n\n   - **Resource Management**:\n     - Players must carefully manage their resources to sustain the mission. Running out of essential resources (e.g., Oxygen) can lead to the failure of the mission.\n     - Resources can be replenished by discovering resource-rich planets or completing certain tasks.\n\n   - **Cooperative Play**:\n     - Players must discuss and plan their actions together. Each player's unique abilities should complement the team, and decisions should be made collectively.\n     - Players can trade resources and assist each other during their turns.\n\n   - **Discovery and Win Condition**:\n     - Players must explore different planets and space anomalies to find clues about alien civilizations.\n     - To make a discovery, players must accumulate a certain number of Research Points and successfully complete a research task.\n     - The game is won when the team makes three successful discoveries of different alien civilizations.\n\n3. Explanation of How the Game Meets the Given Constraints:\n   - **Resource Management**: The game requires players to manage resources like Fuel, Food, Oxygen, and Research Points to sustain their mission and make discoveries.\n   - **Cooperative Game**: Players must work together, leveraging their unique abilities and planning their actions collectively to succeed.\n   - **Win Condition Based on Discovery**: The primary objective is to discover and document alien civilizations, which is achieved by exploring, researching, and making successful discoveries.",
            "1. **Overview of the Game's Objective:**\n\n   In \"Galactic Explorers,\" players are astronauts working together to explore a distant galaxy. The objective is to successfully discover and document three new habitable planets before running out of resources. Cooperation and strategic resource management are key to achieving this goal.\n\n2. **Detailed Game Rules and Mechanics:**\n\n   **Setup:**\n   - Players: 2-4\n   - Components: \n     - 1 game board representing the galaxy with various sectors\n     - 4 player pawns (one for each player)\n     - Resource tokens (Oxygen, Fuel, Food, Research Points)\n     - Discovery cards (planets, space anomalies, black holes)\n     - Event deck (random events affecting resources and movement)\n\n   **Game Turn:**\n   Each turn consists of the following phases:\n   - **Resource Collection Phase:**\n     - Roll a die to determine the amount of each resource collected. All players share these resources.\n   - **Action Phase:**\n     - Each player can perform up to 2 actions per turn, such as:\n       1. **Move**: Move their pawn to an adjacent sector (costs 1 Fuel).\n       2. **Research**: Spend Research Points to draw a Discovery card.\n       3. **Gather Resources**: Roll the die to gather additional resources from the current sector.\n       4. **Assist**: Transfer resources to another player or help another player in the same sector (costs 1 Oxygen).\n   - **Event Phase:**\n     - Draw an event card and resolve its effects (e.g., meteor shower, resource depletion, equipment malfunction).\n   \n   **Resource Management:**\n   - Players must carefully manage shared resources. Each player has a personal resource tracker, but resources are pooled for strategic purposes.\n   - Resources are required for actions and surviving the harsh conditions of space. Running out of any resource (Oxygen, Fuel, or Food) results in negative consequences.\n   \n   **Discovery and Win Condition:**\n   - The game board has sectors that can be explored. Some contain Discovery cards that players can obtain through Research actions.\n   - To win, players must collectively discover and document three habitable planets. This involves gathering specific data points from Discovery cards and spending Research Points to complete documentation.\n   - The game ends in a win if the three habitable planets are documented before resources run out. It ends in a loss if resources are depleted beyond recovery.\n\n3. **Explanation of How the Game Meets the Given Constraints:**\n\n   - **Theme: Space Exploration**\n     - The game is set in a galaxy where players are astronauts exploring new frontiers and seeking habitable planets.\n   \n   - **Resource Management:**\n     - Players must manage Oxygen, Fuel, Food, and Research Points. These resources are shared, requiring cooperation and strategic planning to ensure survival and progress.\n   \n   - **Cooperative Game:**\n     - Players work together to explore the galaxy, gather resources, and make discoveries. The cooperative nature is emphasized through shared resources and mutual goals.\n   \n   - **Win Condition Based on Discovery:**\n     - The primary win condition involves discovering and documenting three new habitable planets. This aligns with the exploration theme and requires players to focus on achieving specific discovery-related objectives.\n\nOverall, \"Galactic Explorers\" is a cooperative space exploration game that challenges players to manage resources wisely and work together to achieve a common goal of discovering habitable planets.",

The ultimate objective is to discover three unique alien artifacts that provide the key to interstellar travel and win the game.\n\n2. **Detailed Game Rules and Mechanics:**\n\n   **Setup:**\n   - 2-4 players.\n   - A game board representing a galaxy with multiple planets.\n   - Each player controls a spaceship with a unique crew.\n   - Resource tokens (fuel, food, minerals).\n   - Discovery cards (alien artifacts, scientific discoveries, hazards).\n   - A turn tracker to measure time (20 turns).\n   - Player and spaceship boards to manage resources and crew.\n\n   **Gameplay:**\n   - Players start with a set amount of resources and a spaceship with specific capabilities.\n   - Each turn is divided into phases: Planning, Exploration, Resource Management, and Event Resolution.\n\n   **Phases:**\n   - **Planning Phase:** Players discuss and plan their actions, such as which planets to explore and how to allocate resources.\n   - **Exploration Phase:** Players move their spaceships to different planets. Each planet requires a certain amount of fuel to reach.\n   - **Resource Management Phase:** Players must manage their resources carefully. Food is required to sustain the crew, and minerals can be used to upgrade ships or trade for other resources.\n   - **Event Resolution Phase:** Draw Discovery cards for each planet explored. These can include alien artifacts, scientific discoveries, or hazards like space storms or alien encounters. Players must resolve these events cooperatively.\n\n   **Win Condition:**\n   - The game is won when players discover three unique alien artifacts within the 20-turn limit.\n   - If players run out of resources or time, the game is lost.\n\n3. **Explanation of How the Game Meets the Given Constraints:**\n\n   - **Resource Management:** Players must carefully manage resources like fuel, food, and minerals to ensure their survival and progress. Decisions on how to allocate resources are critical to the team's success.\n   - **Cooperative Game:** Players work together to plan their exploration, manage resources, and resolve events. Communication and collaboration are key to overcoming challenges and achieving the objective.\n   - **Win Condition Based on Discovery:** The primary goal of the game is to discover three unique alien artifacts. This discovery-driven win condition aligns with the theme of space exploration and provides a clear and engaging objective for players.\n\n\"Galactic Quest\" offers an immersive and strategic cooperative experience, combining resource management and exploration in a space-themed adventure.",
