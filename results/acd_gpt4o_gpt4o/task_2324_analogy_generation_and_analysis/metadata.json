            "Analysis: The analogy compares two pairs of concepts: a sword and a warrior, and a pen and a writer. In the first pair, a sword is a tool or weapon that a warrior uses to perform their duties, typically involving combat or defense. The sword symbolizes the means by which a warrior exerts their strength, skill, and influence.\n\nIn the second pair, a pen is likened to a weapon for a writer. Just as a sword is essential for a warrior, a pen is essential for a writer. The pen represents the writer's primary tool for creation, communication, and expression. It symbolizes the means by which a writer conveys ideas, stories, and arguments, thus exerting their intellectual influence.\n\nThe relationship conveyed by the analogy is that both pairs involve a key instrument or tool used by a professional to practice their craft and exert their particular form of power or influence. The sword and the pen are both emblematic of their respective professions\u2014one of physical might and the other of intellectual or creative prowess.",
            "Analysis: The analogy compares the relationship between a sword and a warrior to the relationship between a pen and a writer. In this analogy, the sword is identified as the primary tool or instrument used by a warrior in their craft of fighting or combat. Similarly, the pen is identified as the primary tool or instrument used by a writer in their craft of writing or creating literary works. The analogy highlights that just as a warrior relies on a sword to perform their duties effectively, a writer relies on a pen to express their thoughts, ideas, and stories. Both pairs emphasize the importance of the tool in the respective professions, showing that the tool is essential for the practitioner to fulfill their role and achieve their objectives.",
