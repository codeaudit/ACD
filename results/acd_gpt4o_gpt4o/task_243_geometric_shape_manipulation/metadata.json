This means both the major and minor axes of the ellipse become 1.5 times longer. The ellipse increases in size, but its proportion as an ellipse is maintained.\n\n   - **Step 3: Translate 3 units left**:\n     Finally, the scaled ellipse is translated 3 units to the left along the x-axis. This shifts every point of the ellipse 3 units to the left without altering its shape or size.\n\nIn summary, both the hexagon and the ellipse undergo three transformations: a rotation that changes their orientation, a scaling that increases their size, and a translation that shifts their position. After these transformations, the hexagon remains a larger, rotated, and shifted hexagon, and the ellipse remains a larger, rotated, and shifted ellipse.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. Hexagon:\n- Original Shape: A regular hexagon with six equal sides.\n- Rotate 45 degrees: The hexagon is rotated 45 degrees around its center. As the hexagon has rotational symmetry, it still appears as a hexagon, but its orientation is different.\n- Scale by a factor of 1.5: Each side of the hexagon is multiplied by 1.5, increasing the overall size of the hexagon while maintaining its shape.\n- Translate 3 units left: The scaled, rotated hexagon is then moved 3 units to the left along the x-axis.\n\nResulting Shape: A larger hexagon (scaled by 1.5) that is rotated 45 degrees from its original orientation and shifted 3 units left.\n\n2. Ellipse:\n- Original Shape: An ellipse with a major and minor axis.\n- Rotate 45 degrees: The ellipse is rotated 45 degrees around its center. The axes of the ellipse are now oriented at a 45-degree angle.\n- Scale by a factor of 1.5: Both the major and minor axes of the ellipse are scaled by 1.5, making the ellipse larger while preserving its proportions.\n- Translate 3 units left: The scaled, rotated ellipse is then moved 3 units to the left along the x-axis.\n\nResulting Shape: A larger ellipse (scaled by 1.5) that is rotated 45 degrees from its original orientation and shifted 3 units left."
