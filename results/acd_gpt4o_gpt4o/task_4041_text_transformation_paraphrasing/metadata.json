Advanced LLMs can reliably perform these tasks.\n\nGiven these points, the success of the agent in this task is aligned with the expected capabilities of a well-trained LLM. Such tasks, while challenging for humans, tend to be within the skill set of advanced LLMs due to their training data and inherent flexibility in language manipulation.\n\nDecision: No"
