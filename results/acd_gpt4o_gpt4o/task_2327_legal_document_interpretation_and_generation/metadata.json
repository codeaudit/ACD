Overview of the clause:\nThis clause pertains to subletting the leased premises and specifies the conditions under which the lessee (the person renting the property) can sublet the property to another party.\n\n2. Explanation of primary conditions:\nThe primary condition set forth in the clause is that the lessee must obtain prior written consent from the lessor (the property owner or landlord) before subletting the leased premises. This means the lessee cannot sublet the property without first securing permission from the lessor in writing.\n\n3. Explanation of secondary conditions:\nThe secondary condition adds that the lessor's consent to sublet the property cannot be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This implies that the lessor must have a valid reason if they choose to deny the request to sublet and must provide their decision within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n4. Any additional notable details:\nThis clause aims to balance the interests of both the lessor and the lessee by allowing the lessee the possibility to sublet the property while protecting the lessor's control over who occupies their property. The requirement for the lessor to act reasonably in granting or denying consent is intended to prevent arbitrary refusals or unnecessary delays.",

Explanation of primary conditions:\nThe primary condition is that the lessee must obtain prior written consent from the lessor (landlord) before subletting the property. This means that the tenant cannot sublet the property without getting explicit permission in writing from the landlord.\n\n3. Explanation of secondary conditions:\nThe secondary condition is that the lessor's consent to sublet \"shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\" This implies that while the landlord has the right to grant or deny permission, they must do so reasonably and without unnecessary delay. The landlord cannot arbitrarily or capriciously refuse consent or take an excessive amount of time to provide a decision.\n\n4. Any additional notable details:\nThis clause aims to balance the interests of both parties: it allows the landlord to have control over who occupies their property, while also protecting the tenant from unreasonable denials or delays in the approval process for subletting.",
            "1. Overview of the clause:\nThis clause outlines the conditions under which a lessee (tenant) can sublet the leased premises to another party. It emphasizes the need for the lessor's (landlord's) prior written consent for any subletting arrangement.\n\n2. Explanation of primary conditions:\nThe primary condition is that the lessee must obtain the lessor's prior written consent before subletting the leased premises. This means that the lessee cannot allow another person or entity to occupy or use the leased property without first receiving explicit, written approval from the lessor.\n\n3. Explanation of secondary conditions:\nThe secondary condition is that the lessor's consent to subletting cannot be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This means that the lessor must act fairly and promptly in deciding whether to grant or deny consent for subletting. The lessor cannot arbitrarily refuse to give consent or unnecessarily delay their decision.\n\n4. Any additional notable details:\nThe clause implies a legal standard of reasonableness for the lessor's decision-making process. If a dispute arises over whether the lessor's refusal or delay was reasonable, it may be subject to legal interpretation or adjudication.",
            "1. Overview of the clause:\nThe clause stipulates conditions under which the lessee (tenant) may sublet the leased premises.\n\n2. Explanation of primary conditions:\nThe lessee is prohibited from subletting the leased premises unless they obtain prior written consent from the lessor (landlord).\n\n3. Explanation of secondary conditions:\nThe lessor's consent to the sublet must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This means that the landlord must have a valid reason for refusing consent and must provide their decision within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n4.

This means that without the written approval, the lessee is prohibited from subletting the property.\n\n3. Explanation of secondary conditions:\nThe secondary condition is that the lessor's consent to sublet must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This imposes a requirement on the lessor to act fairly and promptly when considering the lessee's request to sublet. The lessor cannot arbitrarily refuse or unnecessarily delay giving their consent.\n\n4. Any additional notable details:\nThere is an implied obligation for both parties to engage in the process of seeking and granting consent in good faith.

This means the lessee cannot sublet the property without first securing permission from the lessor in writing.\n\n3. Explanation of secondary conditions:\nThe secondary condition adds that the lessor's consent to sublet the property cannot be unreasonably withheld or delayed. This implies that the lessor must have a valid reason if they choose to deny the request to sublet and must provide their decision within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n4. Any additional notable details:\nThis clause aims to balance the interests of both the lessor and the lessee by allowing the lessee the possibility to sublet the property while protecting the lessor's control over who occupies their property.
