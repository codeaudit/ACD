While LLMs can generate text and follow structured instructions, their ability to handle spatial reasoning and logical consistency in a moderately complex scenario is not guaranteed and can vary. Therefore, the success in this task is somewhat surprising and indicates that the LLM has a good grasp of spatial relationships and descriptive ability.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
