Given that LLMs are typically good at generating structured text based on examples and prompts, this task falls within the capabilities of an LLM.\n\n2. **Criteria for Success:** The success criteria include listing ingredients with quantities, providing clear preparation steps, detailed cooking instructions, estimated cooking time, and serving size. These are all pieces of information that an LLM can generate based on its training data.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method:** The evaluation uses another LLM (via `eval_with_llm_judge`) to judge the quality of the generated recipe. While using an LLM judge is not always ideal, it can be suitable for structured tasks like recipe generation where clear criteria can be established.\n\nGiven the above points, the task itself is not overly complex for an LLM, and the use of an LLM for evaluation is reasonable in this context.\n\n**Decision: No**"
