            "content": "Given the task family \"combinatorial_problems,\" the tasks involve solving advanced mathematical problems that require a deep understanding of permutations, combinations, and graph theory. These areas demand sophisticated mathematical reasoning, algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving abilities.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Mathematical Reasoning**: Advanced combinatorial problems typically require an understanding of complex mathematical concepts and the ability to apply these concepts accurately.\n2. **Algorithmic Thinking**: The problems require systematic approaches to breaking down the problem, applying relevant formulas, and ensuring the correctness of intermediate steps.\n3. **Problem-Solving**: The tasks involve multi-step solutions where each step builds on the previous one, necessitating a coherent and logical flow of thought.\n\n### Task Instructions:\n- The LLM is asked to solve problems and provide detailed step-by-step explanations, including intermediate steps and calculations.\n- The scoring is automated using an LLM judge, which evaluates the correctness of the solution based on the provided criteria.\n\n### Evaluation:\nConsidering the task's complexity and the requirement for detailed explanations:\n- **Success**: If the LLM agent succeeded at the task, it demonstrates a remarkable ability to handle complex mathematical reasoning and provide coherent, step-by-step solutions. This is especially noteworthy given the high estimated human difficulty of the task.\n- **Failure**: If the LLM agent failed, it would be less surprising because advanced combinatorial problems are inherently challenging even for humans and often require specialized knowledge.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the high difficulty of the task and the requirement for detailed, correct, and coherent solutions, the success of the LLM agent is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
