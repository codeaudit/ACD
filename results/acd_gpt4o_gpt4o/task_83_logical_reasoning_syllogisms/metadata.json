All humans are mammals. Therefore, all humans are animals.\") is a straightforward application of deductive reasoning, which is well within the capabilities of LLMs.\n3. **Instruction Clarity**: The instructions are clear and provide a structured format for the response, which LLMs are particularly good at following.\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The use of an LLM judge for evaluation is appropriate, as it allows for consistency in scoring based on predefined criteria.\n\nGiven these points, the success of the LLM agent in this task is not surprising.
