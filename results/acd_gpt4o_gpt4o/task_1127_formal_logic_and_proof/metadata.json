We need to prove that the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers can be expressed as \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).\n2. Consider the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers, denoted as \\( S \\). Therefore, \\( S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n \\).\n3. Write this sum in reverse order: \\( S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\ldots + 1 \\).\n4. Now, add these two equations:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{aligned}\n   S &= 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n \\\\\n   S &= n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\ldots + 1 \\\\\n   \\end{aligned}\n   \\]\n5. Adding these equations term-by-term, we get:\n   \\[\n   2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + \\ldots + (n + 1)\n   \\]\n6. Each pair of terms in the sum on the right-hand side equals \\( n + 1 \\). Since there are \\( n \\) such pairs, we have:\n   \\[\n   2S = n (n + 1)\n   \\]\n7. Solving for \\( S \\), we divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n8.

            "Statement: Prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers is (n*(n+1))/2.\n\nProof:\n1. We need to prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers, denoted as S(n), is given by the formula S(n) = (n*(n+1))/2.\n\n2. Let's use mathematical induction to prove this statement.\n\n3. **Base Case**: Verify the statement for n = 1.\n   - The sum of the first 1 natural number is 1.\n   - According to the formula, S(1) = (1*(1+1))/2 = 1.\n   - Therefore, the base case holds true.\n\n4. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, i.e., assume S(k) = (k*(k+1))/2.\n   - We need to show that the statement is true for k + 1, i.e., S(k+1) = ((k+1)*(k+2))/2.\n\n5. By the definition of the sum of the first n natural numbers:\n   - S(k+1) = S(k) + (k+1).\n   - Using the inductive hypothesis, substitute S(k) = (k*(k+1))/2 into the equation:\n     S(k+1) = (k*(k+1))/2 + (k+1).\n\n6. Factor out (k+1) from the right-hand side:\n   - S(k+1) = (k*(k+1))/2 + 2*(k+1)/2.\n   - S(k+1) = (k*(k+1) + 2*(k+1))/2.\n   - S(k+1) = ((k+1)*(k + 2))/2.\n\n7.
