For a pH of 7.4 and considering the pKa of the phosphate buffer system is approximately 7.2:\n     \\[\n     \\text{pH} = \\text{pKa} + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{base form}]}{[\\text{acid form}]}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     7.4 = 7.2 + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Na2HPO4}]}{[\\text{NaH2PO4}]}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Na2HPO4}]}{[\\text{NaH2PO4}]}\\right) \\approx 0.2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{[\\text{Na2HPO4}]}{[\\text{NaH2PO4}]} \\approx 1.6\n     \\]\n     Thus, the ratio of Na2HPO4 to NaH2PO4 should be approximately 1.6:1.\n\n2. **Weighing the Reagents:**\n   - Weigh out approximately 1.56 g of Na2HPO4 (0.02 M for 500 mL solution).\n   - Weigh out approximately 0.78 g of NaH2PO4 (0.01 M for 500 mL solution).\n\n3. **Dissolving the Reagents:**\n   - In a 200 mL beaker, dissolve the weighed Na2HPO4 in about 100 mL of distilled water.\n   - In another 100 mL beaker, dissolve the weighed NaH2PO4 in about 50 mL of distilled water.\n\n4. **Mixing the Solutions:**\n   - Pour the NaH2PO4 solution into the Na2HPO4 solution.\n   - Mix thoroughly using a stirring rod or magnetic stirrer.\n\n5. **Adjusting the Volume:**\n   - Transfer the mixed solution to a 500 mL volumetric flask.\n   - Rinse the beakers with distilled water and add the rinses to the volumetric flask.\n   - Fill the volumetric flask with distilled water up to the 500 mL mark.\n\n6. **pH Adjustment:**\n   - Check the pH of the solution using a calibrated pH meter or pH indicator strips.\n   - If necessary, adjust the pH to 7.4 by adding small amounts of NaOH (for increasing pH) or HCl (for decreasing pH), mixing thoroughly after each addition, and rechecking the pH.\n\n7. **Final Steps:**\n   - Once the pH is adjusted to 7.4, ensure the solution is well mixed.\n   - Label the flask with the contents, pH, and date of preparation.\n\n**Disposal:**\n- Dispose of any waste materials according to your institution's chemical waste disposal guidelines.\n- Clean all equipment and work surfaces after completing the procedure.\n\n**Storage:**\n- Store the buffer solution in a clean, labeled container at room temperature or as specified for the reagents used.\n\nThis protocol ensures the preparation of a 500 mL phosphate buffer solution with a pH of 7.4 using common laboratory reagents and standard safety practices.",
