            "Answer: lion\n\nYou decide to choose the door with the lion symbol, feeling a sense of courage welling up within you. As you push open the heavy wooden door, it creaks loudly, echoing through the vast chamber. The room beyond is dimly lit by flickering torches mounted on the stone walls. The air is thick with the scent of old parchment and leather.\n\nStepping inside, you notice a large stone pedestal in the center of the room, atop which rests an ancient, ornate book bound in gold and emblazoned with the symbol of the lion. The pages seem to glow faintly, as if imbued with some kind of magical energy. Surrounding the pedestal are several stone statues of lions, each in a different pose, as if guarding the precious tome.\n\nApproaching the pedestal cautiously, you feel the weight of the room's silence pressing down on you. The book seems to call out to you, urging you to open it and uncover its secrets. As you reach out to touch the cover, a low growl reverberates through the chamber, and the eyes of the lion statues begin to glow a bright, piercing yellow.\n\nYou can:\n\n1. Open the book and read its contents.\n2. Step back and examine the statues more closely.\n3. Leave the room and try another door.",

At the center of the room stands a grand statue of a lion, majestic and imposing. Its eyes seem to follow you as you move closer. Suddenly, a deep rumbling sound fills the chamber, and the lion's mouth opens, revealing a hidden compartment inside.\n\nInside the compartment, you find an ancient scroll and a golden key. The scroll is inscribed with cryptic symbols and a map that appears to lead deeper into the temple. The key, intricately designed with the lion symbol, glints in the torchlight.\n\nYou realize that this is a clue, a part of a larger puzzle that you must solve to uncover the temple's secrets.

The statue's eyes begin to glow a bright green, and a voice, seemingly coming from the statue itself, echoes in the room: \"Only the one who understands the serpent's wisdom may proceed. Answer this riddle to continue: I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\"\n\nYou ponder the riddle, knowing that the correct answer is crucial for your journey to continue.",

It watches you intently with piercing eyes. As you move closer to the pedestal, the eagle lets out a loud screech and swoops down, landing gracefully next to you. It speaks with a commanding yet melodic voice, \"Only the worthy may take the orb. Prove your wisdom by answering my riddle, and the prize shall be yours.\"\n\nThe eagle poses its riddle: \"I can fly without wings. I can cry without eyes. Whenever I go, darkness flies. What am I?\"\n\nYou ponder the riddle, knowing that your answer will determine your fate."
