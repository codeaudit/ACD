Procedure:\n1. Wear safety goggles, lab coat, and gloves to ensure safety.\n2. Rinse the burette with distilled water, then with the standard NaOH solution to remove any impurities.\n3. Fill the burette with the standard NaOH solution using a funnel, ensuring that there are no air bubbles. Record the initial volume.\n4.

Add 2-3 drops of the phenolphthalein indicator to the unknown salt solution in the conical flask.\n7. Place the conical flask on a white tile to better observe the color change.\n8. Slowly add the NaOH solution from the burette to the conical flask, swirling the flask continuously to mix.\n9. Continue adding the NaOH solution until a sustained color change (from colorless to pink) is observed, indicating the endpoint of the titration.\n10. Record the final volume of the NaOH solution in the burette.\n11. Repeat the titration at least three times to obtain consistent results.\n\n4. Data Collection:\n- Record the initial and final volumes of the NaOH solution in the burette for each titration.\n- Calculate the volume of NaOH solution used in each titration by subtracting the initial volume from the final volume.\n- Record the observed color change and any other relevant observations.\n\n5. Analysis:\n1. Calculate the average volume of NaOH solution used from the multiple titrations.\n2.

Rearrange the formula to solve for \\( M_2 \\) (the molarity of the unknown salt solution):\n\\[ M_2 = \\frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} \\]\n4. Substitute the known values (average volume of NaOH used, molarity of NaOH, and volume of the unknown solution) into the formula to calculate the concentration of the unknown salt solution.\n5.
