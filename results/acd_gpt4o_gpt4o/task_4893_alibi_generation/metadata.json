Consider a right-angled triangle with legs 'a' and 'b', and hypotenuse 'c'.\n2. Construct a square with side length 'a+b'.\n3. Inside this square, place four copies of the right-angled triangle.\n4.

Therefore, (a+b)^2 = c^2 + 2ab.\n8. Expanding (a+b)^2 gives a^2 + 2ab + b^2.\n9. Equating the two expressions, we get a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = c^2 + 2ab.\n10.

The task of generating a plausible alibi involves following a logical sequence of events, which should be within the capabilities of a well-trained LLM.\n\n2. **Narrative Generation**: LLMs excel at creating detailed and engaging narratives. Crafting a believable alibi is a narrative task that requires the model to generate a story that fits within the given constraints, which is a strength of many advanced LLMs.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: The task requires the LLM to interpret and incorporate specific constraints into the generated narrative. LLMs have shown the ability to understand and apply contextual information effectively, especially when the constraints are explicitly provided.\n\n### Human Difficulty:\n\nThe task is marked as difficult for humans, likely due to the need for creativity, attention to detail, and ensuring consistency with constraints. However, LLMs can handle such tasks efficiently due to their extensive training on diverse datasets.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThe task is designed to be automatically scored using the `eval_with_llm_judge` function, which will assess the plausibility and consistency of the generated alibi. Assuming the evaluation function is robust and reliable, this is a suitable method for evaluating the LLM's performance.\n\n### Decision:\n\nGiven that advanced LLMs are capable of logical reasoning, narrative generation, and contextual understanding, it is not surprising that the LLM agent succeeded at this task. The model's abilities align well with the requirements of the task.\n\n**Decision: No**"
