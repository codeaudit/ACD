            "Modified Recipe: \n- 200g spaghetti\n- 2 large eggs\n- 50g pecorino cheese\n- 50g parmesan\n- 2 cloves garlic\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms\n- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika\n- Salt\n- Pepper\n\nExplanation: \nTo make the Spaghetti Carbonara recipe vegetarian, I removed the pancetta, which is a type of meat. Instead of using any meat substitutes, I added chopped mushrooms, which provide a satisfying texture and umami flavor. To give a smoky flavor reminiscent of pancetta, I included smoked paprika. This maintains the depth of flavor and richness in the dish without using any meat or meat substitutes. The rest of the ingredients remain the same, as they are already vegetarian-friendly.",
