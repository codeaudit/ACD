Then,\n   \\[\n   (AB)(B^{-1}A^{-1}) = A(BB^{-1})A^{-1} = AIA^{-1} = AA^{-1} = I\n   \\]\n   Similarly,\n   \\[\n   (B^{-1}A^{-1})(AB) = B^{-1}(A^{-1}A)B = B^{-1}IB = B^{-1}B = I\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\( AB \\) has an inverse, \\( B^{-1}A^{-1} \\), and is thus invertible. Hence, the set is closed under matrix multiplication.\n\n2. **Associativity**:\n   Matrix multiplication is known to be associative. For any three 2x2 matrices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\),\n   \\[\n   (AB)C = A(BC)\n   \\]\n   This property holds for all matrices, including invertible ones.\n\n3. **Identity Element**:\n   The identity element in the context of matrix multiplication is the identity matrix \\( I \\):\n   \\[\n   I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n   For any invertible 2x2 matrix \\( A \\),\n   \\[\n   AI = IA = A\n   \\]\n   Thus, the identity matrix is indeed the identity element for the set of invertible 2x2 matrices.\n\n4. **Invertibility**:\n   By definition, every element in the set is invertible. For any invertible 2x2 matrix \\( A \\), there exists an inverse matrix \\( A^{-1} \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I\n   \\]\n   Therefore, each element has an inverse within the set.\n\nSince the set of all 2x2 invertible matrices with real entries satisfies closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverses, it forms a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nAnswer: The set of all 2x2 invertible matrices with real entries forms a group under matrix multiplication."
