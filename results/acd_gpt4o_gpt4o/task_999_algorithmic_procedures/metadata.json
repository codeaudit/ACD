            "1. **Initialize the Array**: Start with an array of integers that you want to sort, for example: `arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`.\n\n2. **Determine the Length of the Array**: Calculate the length of the array, `n`, which will be used to control the number of iterations. For the given array, `n = len(arr)`.\n\n3. **Outer Loop Setup**: Set up an outer loop that runs from the first element to the second last element. This loop will help in making multiple passes over the array. For example, `for i in range(n-1)`.\n\n4. **Initialize the Inner Loop**: Inside the outer loop, set up an inner loop that runs from the first element to the `n-i-1` element. This loop will compare adjacent elements and perform the necessary swaps. For example, `for j in range(0, n-i-1)`.\n\n5. **Compare Adjacent Elements**: Within the inner loop, compare the current element with the next element. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them to ensure the larger element moves towards the end of the array. For example:\n   ```\n   if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n       arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n   ```\n\n6. **Repeat until Sorted**: Continue running the outer and inner loops until the entire array is sorted. The number of passes required is `n-1` because with each pass, the largest unsorted element gets 'bubbled' to its correct position.\n\n7. **Optimization (Optional)**: To optimize, include a flag to check if any swapping is done in the inner loop. If no swapping occurs, the array is already sorted, and you can break out of the loop early. For example:\n   ```\n   swapped = False\n   if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n       arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n       swapped = True\n   if not swapped:\n       break\n   ```\n\n8. **End of Algorithm**: Once the loops complete, the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\nPutting it all together, the complete bubble sort algorithm in Python looks like this:\n```\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can sort an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort method.",
            "Step 1: Initialize the Array\n- Start with an array of integers that you want to sort. For example, let's consider the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Length of the Array\n- Calculate the length of the array, denoted as `n`. For our example, `n = 6`.\n\nStep 3: Outer Loop (Passes)\n- Set up an outer loop that runs from the first element to the last element of the array. This loop will track the number of passes required to ensure the array is sorted.\n- The outer loop counter is `i`, which will run from `0` to `n-1`.\n\nStep 4: Inner Loop (Comparisons)\n- Within each pass, set up an inner loop that runs from the first element to `n-i-1`. This loop performs the comparisons and swaps needed to gradually move the largest unsorted element to its correct position.\n- The inner loop counter is `j`, which will run from `0` to `n-i-2`.\n\nStep 5: Compare Adjacent Elements\n- For each iteration of the inner loop, compare the current element (`array[j]`) with the next element (`array[j+1]`).\n\nStep 6: Swap if Necessary\n- If `array[j]` is greater than `array[j+1]`, swap these two elements. This ensures that the larger element moves towards the end of the array.\n\nStep 7: Repeat for All Elements\n- Continue the process of comparing and swapping for all elements in the inner loop for the current outer loop pass.\n\nStep 8: Next Pass\n- After completing all comparisons and swaps for the current outer loop pass, the largest unsorted element will have moved to its correct position.\n- Increment the outer loop counter `i` and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nStep 9: Terminate the Algorithm\n- The algorithm terminates once the outer loop has completed `n-1` passes, indicating that all elements are in ascending order.\n\nStep 10: Output the Sorted Array\n- The array is now sorted in ascending order. Output the sorted array.\n\nExample Walkthrough:\nGiven array: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n\nPass 1:\n- Compare 5 and 2, swap -> `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n- Compare 5 and 9, no swap\n- Compare 9 and 1, swap -> `[2, 5, 1, 9, 5, 6]`\n- Compare 9 and 5, swap -> `[2, 5, 1, 5, 9, 6]`\n- Compare 9 and 6, swap -> `[2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 9]`\n\nPass 2:\n- Compare 2 and 5, no swap\n- Compare 5 and 1, swap -> `[2, 1, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n- Compare 5 and 5, no swap\n- Compare 5 and 6, no swap\n\nPass 3:\n- Compare 2 and 1, swap -> `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n- Compare 2 and 5, no swap\n- Compare 5 and 5, no swap\n\nPass 4:\n- Compare 1 and 2, no swap\n- Compare 2 and 5, no swap\n\nPass 5:\n- Compare 1 and 2, no swap\n\nThe array is now sorted: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`.",

For example, if the array is `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`, then `n = 5`.\n\n3. **Outer Loop for Passes**:\n   - Use a loop to iterate over the array `n-1` times. This is because after `n-1` passes, the array will be sorted.\n   - For example, `for i from 0 to n-2`.\n\n4. **Inner Loop for Comparisons**:\n   - Inside the outer loop, use another loop to iterate through the array from the beginning to `n-i-2`. This loop will compare adjacent elements and swap them if needed.\n   - For example, `for j from 0 to n-i-2`.\n\n5. **Compare and Swap**:\n   - Within the inner loop, compare the current element with the next element.\n   - If the current element (`array[j]`) is greater than the next element (`array[j+1]`), swap them.\n   - Example: If `array[j] > array[j+1]`, then swap `array[j]` and `array[j+1]`.\n\n6. **Repeat Until Sorted**:\n   - Continue the process for all elements in the array for each pass. After each pass, the largest element in the unsorted section of the array bubbles up to its correct position.\n\n7. **End of Algorithm**:\n   - After completing `n-1` passes, the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\n8. **Return or Output the Sorted Array**:\n   - The final sorted array can be returned or printed.\n\n**Example of Execution**:\n- Given array: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`\n- Pass 1 (i=0):\n  - Compare 5 and 3, swap: `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`\n  - Compare 5 and 8, no swap: `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`\n  - Compare 8 and 4, swap: `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]`\n  - Compare 8 and 2, swap: `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`\n- Pass 2 (i=1):\n  - Compare 3 and 5, no swap: `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`\n  - Compare 5 and 4, swap: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]`\n  - Compare 5 and 2, swap: `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n  - (8 is already in correct position)\n- Pass 3 (i=2):\n  - Compare 3 and 4, no swap: `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n  - Compare 4 and 2, swap: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n  - (5 and 8 are already in correct positions)\n- Pass 4 (i=3):\n  - Compare 3 and 2, swap: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`\n  - (4, 5, and 8 are already in correct positions)\n\nFinal sorted array: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.",

The outer loop runs from the first index to the second-to-last index of the array (`for i in range(n-1)`).\n\n4. **Inner Loop for Comparisons**:\n   - Inside the outer loop, use another loop to perform the comparisons and swaps. This inner loop runs from the first index to `n-1-i` (`for j in range(0, n-1-i)`). The `i` in `n-1-i` ensures that with each pass, the last `i` elements are already sorted and do not need to be checked again.\n\n5. **Compare Adjacent Elements**:\n   - Inside the inner loop, compare each pair of adjacent elements. If the element at index `j` is greater than the element at index `j+1`, then swap these two elements. This ensures that the larger elements \"bubble up\" to the end of the array.\n\n6. **Perform the Swap if Necessary**:\n   - If `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`, then perform the swap:\n     ```\n     temp = arr[j]\n     arr[j] = arr[j+1]\n     arr[j+1] = temp\n     ```\n\n7. **Repeat for All Elements**:\n   - The inner loop completes one pass of the array, ensuring the largest unsorted element is bubbled to its correct position. The outer loop then moves to the next pass, gradually reducing the range of elements to be compared.\n\n8. **Check for Sorted Array (Optional Optimization)**:\n   - (Optional) Introduce a flag to check if any swaps were made during a pass. If no swaps are made, the array is already sorted, and you can exit the loop early.\n\n9. **End of Sorting**:\n   - After completing all the passes, the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\n10. **Return or Output the Sorted Array**:\n    - The final step is to return or output the sorted array.\n\nExample Pseudocode:\n```\nfunction bubbleSort(arr):\n    n = length(arr)\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        swapped = false\n        for j from 0 to n-1-i:\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                // Swap elements\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[j+1]\n                arr[j+1] = temp\n                swapped = true\n        // If no elements were swapped, the array is sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\nIn summary, the bubble sort algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

This inner loop runs from the first index to `n-1-i` (`for j in range(0, n-1-i)`). The `i` in `n-1-i` ensures that with each pass, the last `i` elements are already sorted and do not need to be checked again.\n\n5. **Compare Adjacent Elements**:\n   - Inside the inner loop, compare each pair of adjacent elements. If the element at index `j` is greater than the element at index `j+1`, then swap these two elements. This ensures that the larger elements \"bubble up\" to the end of the array.\n\n6. **Perform the Swap if Necessary**:\n   - If `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`, then perform the swap:\n     ```\n     temp = arr[j]\n     arr[j] = arr[j+1]\n     arr[j+1] = temp\n     ```\n\n7. **Repeat for All Elements**:\n   - The inner loop completes one pass of the array, ensuring the largest unsorted element is bubbled to its correct position. The outer loop then moves to the next pass, gradually reducing the range of elements to be compared.\n\n8. **Check for Sorted Array (Optional Optimization)**:\n   - (Optional) Introduce a flag to check if any swaps were made during a pass. If no swaps are made, the array is already sorted, and you can exit the loop early.\n\n9. **End of Sorting**:\n   - After completing all the passes, the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\n10. **Return or Output the Sorted Array**:\n    - The final step is to return or output the sorted array.\n\nExample Pseudocode:\n```\nfunction bubbleSort(arr):\n    n = length(arr)\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        swapped = false\n        for j from 0 to n-1-i:\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                // Swap elements\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[j+1]\n                arr[j+1] = temp\n                swapped = true\n        // If no elements were swapped, the array is sorted\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\nIn summary, the bubble sort algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Each pass through the list places the next largest element in its correct position, and this process repeats until the list is sorted.",
            "Answer: \n\nStep-by-Step Procedure for Bubble Sort:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start with an array of integers `arr` of length `n`.\n   - Let `n` be the number of elements in the array.\n\n2. **Outer Loop**:\n   - Create an outer loop that runs from the first element to the last element of the array. This loop will track the number of passes needed to ensure the array is sorted.\n   - Let `i` be the loop variable for the outer loop, which starts at 0 and will run until `n-1`.\n\n3. **Inner Loop**:\n   - Inside the outer loop, create an inner loop that runs from the first element to the `n-i-1` element. This loop is responsible for comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - Let `j` be the loop variable for the inner loop, which starts at 0 and will run until `n-i-2`.\n\n4. **Comparison and Swapping**:\n   - Within the inner loop, compare the current element `arr[j]` with the next element `arr[j+1]`.\n   - If `arr[j]` is greater than `arr[j+1]`, swap these two elements. This ensures that the larger element moves towards the end of the array.\n\n5. **End of Inner Loop**:\n   - The inner loop will complete one pass through the array, ensuring that the largest unsorted element of the array is moved to its correct position at the end of the array.\n\n6. **End of Outer Loop**:\n   - The outer loop will repeat the process for the next largest unsorted element, ensuring that each pass moves the next largest unsorted element to its correct position.\n   - Continue this process until the entire array is sorted, which will take a maximum of `n-1` passes.\n\n7. **Completion**:\n   - After the outer loop completes, the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n   - The algorithm terminates, and the sorted array is the final result.\n\nExample:\nConsider the array `arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.\n\n- Pass 1: Compare and swap elements\n  - `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]` (swap 5 and 3)\n  - `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]` (no swap)\n  - `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]` (swap 8 and 4)\n  - `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]` (swap 8 and 2)\n- Pass 2: Compare and swap elements\n  - `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]` (no swap)\n  - `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]` (swap 5 and 4)\n  - `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]` (swap 5 and 2)\n- Pass 3: Compare and swap elements\n  - `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]` (no swap)\n  - `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]` (swap 4 and 2)\n- Pass 4: Compare and swap elements\n  - `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]` (swap 3 and 2)\n- The array is now sorted: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`.\n\nFollowing this procedure, any array of integers can be sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm."

            "Answer: \n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: The goal is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, which is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Initialize Variables**: Let the two integers be `a` and `b`. Assume `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, swap the values of `a` and `b`.\n\n3. **Begin the Euclidean Algorithm**:\n    - **Step 1**: Check if `b` is zero.\n        - If `b` is zero, the GCD is the value of `a`. Terminate the algorithm.\n        - If `b` is not zero, proceed to the next step.\n    \n4. **Perform Division**: Divide `a` by `b` and find the remainder `r`.

When `b` is zero, the current value of `a` is the GCD of the original pair of integers.\n\n8. **Output the Result**: The final value of `a` is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that each iteration gets you closer to the solution, and the algorithm will always terminate with the correct GCD.",

If \\( a < b \\), swap their values to ensure \\( a \\geq b \\).\n\n2. **Base Case Check**:\n   - If \\( b \\) is zero, then the GCD is \\( a \\). This is because any number divided by zero is undefined, and the GCD of a number with zero is the number itself.\n\n3. **Division Step**:\n   - Divide \\( a \\) by \\( b \\) and calculate the remainder \\( r \\). This can be represented as:\n     \\[\n     r = a \\mod b\n     \\]\n   - The operation \\( a \\mod b \\) gives the remainder when \\( a \\) is divided by \\( b \\).\n\n4. **Update Variables**:\n   - Replace \\( a \\) with \\( b \\) and \\( b \\) with \\( r \\).

            "Answer: \nStep 1: Understand the Problem\n- The task is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nStep 2: Explain the Euclidean Algorithm\n- The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm uses repeated division to reduce the problem size.\n\nStep 3: Initialize the Variables\n- Let the two integers be A and B. Assume A >= B (if not, swap A and B).\n\nStep 4: Check if B is Zero\n- If B is zero, then the GCD is A. This is because any number is the GCD of itself and zero.\n\nStep 5: Perform Division and Find Remainder\n- Divide A by B to get the remainder R (i.e., R = A % B).\n\nStep 6: Update the Values\n- Replace A with B and B with R.\n\nStep 7: Repeat the Process\n- Repeat steps 4 to 6 until B becomes zero.\n\nStep 8: Return the Result\n- When B becomes zero, A contains the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\nStep 9: Example\n- For example, to find the GCD of 48 and 18:\n  a.
