            "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). Normally, the hormone insulin helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. In Type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to insulin's effects, and your pancreas can't make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. This leads to high blood sugar levels, which can cause various health problems over time.\n\nSeveral factors can increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, including being overweight, having a family history of diabetes, being physically inactive, and having high blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol levels. Age and ethnicity can also play roles, with older individuals and certain ethnic groups being more susceptible.\n\nCommon symptoms of Type 2 diabetes include frequent urination, excessive thirst, unexplained weight loss, extreme hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow-healing sores or frequent infections. However, some people may not experience noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages.\n\nManaging Type 2 diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and regular monitoring. Key strategies include:\n\n1. **Healthy Eating:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit sugary foods and refined carbs.\n2. **Physical Activity:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking, swimming, or cycling.\n3. **Weight Management:** Losing even a small amount of weight can significantly improve blood sugar control.\n4. **Medications:** These may include oral medications or insulin injections to help control blood sugar levels.\n5. **Regular Monitoring:** Keep track of your blood sugar levels, and have regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nBy understanding and managing Type 2 diabetes, individuals can lead healthier lives and reduce the risk of complications.",
