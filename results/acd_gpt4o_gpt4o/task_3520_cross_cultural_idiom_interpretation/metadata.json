They can understand and generate human-like text and have access to vast amounts of data, which often includes idiomatic expressions and their contexts.\n- **Human Difficulty:** While interpreting idiomatic expressions from different cultures may be difficult for humans unfamiliar with those cultures, it is not particularly surprising if an LLM succeeds, especially if it has been trained on diverse and extensive datasets.\n- **Task Implementation:** The task implementation appears correct, and the use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to score the task seems appropriate, given that it evaluates the accuracy and cultural nuance of the interpretation and explanation.\n- **Example Provided:** The idiom \"Break the ice\" is quite common and well-documented in English, and explaining it in the context of a social setting is straightforward for an LLM.\n\n**Decision: No**\nThe success of the LLM in interpreting and explaining the idiom \"Break the ice\" is not surprising, given the capabilities of modern LLMs and the nature of the task."
