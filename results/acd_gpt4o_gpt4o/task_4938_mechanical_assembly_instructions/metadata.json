They can understand and output detailed instructions if the task is well-defined.\n- **Spatial Reasoning**: While LLMs can handle descriptive tasks well, spatial reasoning and the precise description of physical assembly steps can be more challenging.\n- **Sequential Steps**: The ability to maintain a logical and sequential flow in instructions is within the capabilities of advanced LLMs, though maintaining context over multiple steps can sometimes be an issue.\n\nGiven that the task is difficult and involves spatial reasoning, the fact that the LLM succeeded could be noteworthy. However, considering the current advancements in LLMs, especially in generating structured and coherent text, the success is not entirely surprising.\n\n**Decision: No**"
