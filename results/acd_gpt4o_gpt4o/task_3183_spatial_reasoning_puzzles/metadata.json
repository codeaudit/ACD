When the large cube is painted, every face of the cube gets paint. \n3. To find the number of 1x1x1 cubes that have paint on exactly one face, we need to consider only the cubes that are on the faces of the large cube but not on the edges or corners. These are the face-center cubes.\n4. Each face of the 3x3x3 cube has a total of 9 small cubes (3 * 3 = 9).\n5. On each face, the cubes on the edges and corners are not counted for our requirement. The corners have 1 cube each and the edges have 1 cube each along the sides of the face.\n6. For a 3x3 grid, the only cubes that have paint on exactly one face are the center cubes of each face. \n7. Each face of the cube has 1 central cube left after excluding the edge and corner cubes.\n8. Since a cube has 6 faces, the total number of 1-unit cubes with paint on exactly one face is 6 (1 for each face).\n\nDiagrams/Visualizations (if any):\n[Imagine a 3x3 face of the cube, where the center cube of each face is the one being counted.]\n\nFinal Answer:\n6",

            "Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. First, let's understand the structure of the 3x3x3 cube. This large cube is made up of 27 smaller 1x1x1 cubes (since 3 * 3 * 3 = 27).\n2. When the large cube is painted, every face of the cube gets paint. \n3. To find the number of 1x1x1 cubes that have paint on exactly one face, we need to consider only the cubes that are on the faces of the large cube but not on the edges or corners. These are the face-center cubes.\n4. Each face of the 3x3x3 cube has a total of 9 small cubes (3 * 3 = 9).\n5. On each face, the cubes on the edges and corners are not counted for our requirement. The corners have 1 cube each and the edges have 1 cube each along the sides of the face.\n6. For a 3x3 grid, the only cubes that have paint on exactly one face are the center cubes of each face. \n7. Each face of the cube has 1 central cube left after excluding the edge and corner cubes.\n8. Since a cube has 6 faces, the total number of 1-unit cubes with paint on exactly one face is 6 (1 for each face).\n\nDiagrams/Visualizations (if any):\n[Imagine a 3x3 face of the cube, where the center cube of each face is the one being counted.]\n\nFinal Answer:\n6",
            "Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Cube**: The original cube has a side length of 3 units, so it can be divided into 3x3x3 smaller cubes, resulting in a total of 27 smaller cubes (since \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\)).\n\n2. **Determine the Position of Cubes with One Painted Face**:\n    - A smaller cube will have exactly one face painted if it is located on the face of the larger cube but not on the edges or corners. \n    - The faces of the larger cube are 3x3 grids. To have only one face painted, the smaller cubes must be within the middle 1x1 section of each face.\n\n3. **Count the One-Face Painted Cubes per Face**:\n    - Each face of the larger cube has a 3x3 grid. The middle section (not on the edges or corners) is a 1x1 grid.\n    - Therefore, each face has only 1 smaller cube with exactly one painted face.\n\n4. **Multiply by the Number of Faces**:\n    - Since a cube has 6 faces and each face contributes 1 smaller cube with exactly one painted face, we multiply the number of such cubes per face by the number of faces:\n    \\[ 1 \\text{ cube per face} \\times 6 \\text{ faces} = 6 \\text{ cubes} \\]\n\nDiagrams/Visualizations (if any):\n- Imagine a 3x3 grid on each face of the cube. Only the center cube of each face will have one painted face, and this is clearly visible when drawing out each face and marking the center cube.\n\nFinal Answer:\nAnswer: 6",
            "Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. **Understanding the problem:**\n   - We have a cube with a side length of 3 units.\n   - The cube is painted on all its surfaces and then cut into 1-unit cubes.\n   - We need to determine how many 1-unit cubes have paint on exactly one face.\n\n2. **Analyzing the structure:**\n   - When the cube is cut into 1-unit cubes, it will result in \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) smaller cubes.\n   - We need to identify which of these smaller cubes will have paint on exactly one face.\n\n3. **Identifying the smaller cubes with one painted face:**\n   - The smaller cubes with paint on exactly one face are those located in the center of each face of the original cube.\n   - Each face of the original cube is a \\(3 \\times 3\\) grid, and the center cube within this grid will have paint on one face.\n   - There are 6 faces on the cube and each face has exactly one center cube with one painted face.\n\n4. **Counting the 1-unit cubes with paint on exactly one face:**\n   - Since each of the 6 faces has one 1-unit cube with paint on exactly one face, we multiply the number of faces by the number of such cubes per face.\n\nDiagrams/Visualizations (if any):\n- Imagine a 3x3 grid on each face of the cube. The center cube in each grid is the one with paint on exactly one face.\n\nFinal Answer:\nAnswer: 6",
            "Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. **Understand the structure of the cube**: The original cube has a side length of 3 units, so it is composed of \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) smaller 1-unit cubes.\n\n2. **Determine the positions of the 1-unit cubes**: The smaller cubes can be categorized into three types based on their positions:\n   - Corner cubes (each with 3 painted faces)\n   - Edge cubes (each with 2 painted faces)\n   - Face-center cubes (each with 1 painted face)\n   - Internal cubes (no painted faces)\n\n3. **Identify the face-center cubes**: These are the cubes that lie in the center of each face of the larger cube. Since the large cube has 6 faces, we need to find how many face-center cubes are on each face.\n\n4. **Calculate the face-center cubes on one face**: On a 3x3 face, the face-center cubes are the ones in the middle of the edges. For a 3x3 grid, each face has 1 face-center cube per face (the center cube of the 3x3 grid).\n\n5. **Sum up the total number of face-center cubes**: Since there are 6 faces and each face has 1 face-center cube, there are \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\) face-center cubes.\n\nDiagrams/Visualizations (if any):\n```\nConsider the 3x3 face of the cube:\n\n[ ] [ ] [ ]\n[ ] [X] [ ]\n[ ] [ ] [ ]\n\nThe 'X' represents the face-center cube on one face. Each of the 6 faces of the cube has one such center cube.\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\nAnswer: 6",
            "Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. **Understand the structure of the cube**: The original cube has a side length of 3 units, which means it is made up of 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 smaller 1-unit cubes.\n2. **Determine where the painted faces are**: Painting the entire surface of the cube means that all six faces of the cube are painted.\n3. **Identify cubes with paint on exactly one face**: These cubes must come from the center of each face of the larger cube. Each face of the larger cube is a 3x3 grid of smaller cubes.\n4. **Count the center cubes on each face**: For a 3x3 face, the center cube is the only one with exactly one face painted. Since there are 6 faces on the cube, and each face has exactly one center cube with one face painted, we multiply to find the total.\n\nDiagrams/Visualizations (if any):\n```\nTop Face (3x3 grid):\n[ P ][ P ][ P ]\n[ P ][ C ][ P ]\n[ P ][ P ][ P ]\n\nWhere P represents painted cubes and C represents the center cube with exactly one face painted.\n```\nSimilarly, each of the six faces of the cube will have a center cube (C) like this.\n\nFinal Answer:\nAnswer: 6"
