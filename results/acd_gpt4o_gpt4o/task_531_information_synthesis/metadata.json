Its effects include rising sea levels, extreme weather, ecosystem disruptions, and adverse impacts on human health and agriculture. Mitigating climate change necessitates global efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to evolving circumstances, and move towards sustainable energy solutions.",
            "Answer: Climate change encompasses long-term alterations in Earth's temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, driven by both natural processes like volcanic eruptions and solar radiation variations, and human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Its consequences include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, ecosystem and wildlife shifts, and impacts on human health and agriculture. Combating climate change necessitates global cooperation to cut greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to new conditions, and shift to sustainable energy sources.",
