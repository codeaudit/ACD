Prior to the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 1700s, manufacturing was often done in peopleâ€™s homes, using hand tools or basic machines. Industrialization marked a shift to powered, special-purpose machinery, factories and mass production.",

While industrialization brought about an increased volume and variety of manufactured goods and an improved standard of living for some, it also resulted in often grim employment and living conditions for the poor and working classes."

These changes can be caused by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, variations in solar radiation, and changes in Earth's orbit, as well as by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.",

Addressing climate change requires global cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to changing conditions, and transition to sustainable energy sources."
