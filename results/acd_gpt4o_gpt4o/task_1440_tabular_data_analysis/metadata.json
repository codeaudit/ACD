The provided example instructions and data are straightforward and involve basic arithmetic operations (summing and averaging) and simple comparisons. These are well within the capabilities of modern LLMs, which are generally proficient in handling structured text and performing elementary calculations.\n\nAdditionally, the example response provided is clear, and the task's requirements are unambiguous. The use of an LLM judge to evaluate the correctness of the result and explanation seems appropriate, as the criteria for success are clearly defined and can be validated through textual analysis.\n\nGiven the state of current LLM capabilities and the nature of the task, it is reasonable to expect that an LLM would succeed in this task without much difficulty.\n\nDecision: No"
