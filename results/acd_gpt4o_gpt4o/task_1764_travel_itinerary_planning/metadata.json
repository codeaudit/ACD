Provide your response in the following format:\n\nDay 1:\n- Activity 1: [Description, Cost]\n- Activity 2: [Description, Cost]\n\nDay 2:\n- Activity 1: [Description, Cost]\n- Activity 2: [Description, Cost]\n\n...\"\"\"\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:\n        from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge\n        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)\n        criteria = [\n            \"The itinerary should include daily activities.\",\n            \"Each activity should have a brief description and an estimated cost.\",\n            \"The plan should be practical and feasible within the given constraints.\",\n            \"The total cost should not exceed the budget.\"\n        ]\n        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0\n\n\"\"\"\n\nRecall that the evaluated LLM agent is only shown the instructions from `get_instructions` and automatically scored via the `score` method.\nDouble check the task's code implementation for correctness, if there are any serious issues that would affect evaluation, ignore this example and return \"No\".\nConsider whether or not an LLM judge is suitable for evaluating the task if the function `eval_with_llm_judge` is called in the `score` method.\n\nIs the success or failure of the LLM agent on this task surprising or noteworthy, and thus should be highlighted?"

            "content": "Given the task family \"travel_itinerary_planning,\" it involves creating a comprehensive travel itinerary based on specific preferences, constraints, and points of interest. This task requires the LLM to synthesize information, reason about logistics and budget, and make decisions to formulate a practical travel plan.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Information Synthesis**: LLMs are generally capable of synthesizing information from various sources, especially when it involves structured data like travel preferences and constraints.\n2. **Reasoning**: The task requires the LLM to reason about how to fit activities within the given constraints (e.g., time, budget), which LLMs have shown varying degrees of success in similar scenarios.\n3. **Decision-Making**: The LLM must make choices about which activities to include and how to structure the days, which involves a level of planning and prioritizing.\n\n### Estimated Human Difficulty:\n- **Difficult**: This is a challenging task for humans due to the need to balance preferences, constraints, and practical feasibility while ensuring the plan is coherent and within budget.\n\n### LLM Capabilities:\n- LLMs have demonstrated capabilities in planning and structuring text based on given criteria.\n- They can estimate costs and provide descriptions based on available data, but ensuring the practical feasibility and adherence to budget constraints can be more challenging.\n\n### Scoring and Evaluation:\n- The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to score the task is reasonable, as it allows for automated evaluation based on predefined criteria.\n- The criteria focus on practical and feasible planning within constraints, which are clear and measurable.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven that an LLM succeeded at this task, it shows its capability to handle complex planning and decision-making, which can be considered a higher-order cognitive function. While LLMs are expected to perform well in text generation and synthesis, the practical aspects and budget constraints add a layer of complexity.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
