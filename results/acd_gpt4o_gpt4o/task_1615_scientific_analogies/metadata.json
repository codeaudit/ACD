These models are typically proficient in generating creative content and have access to extensive knowledge bases, enabling them to understand and explain scientific concepts.\n\nHowever, the task involves not only generating creative analogies but also ensuring that these analogies accurately and clearly convey the intended scientific concepts. This requires a nuanced understanding of both the concept and how to effectively communicate it using an analogy, which can be challenging and subjective.\n\nThe evaluation method using `eval_with_llm_judge` introduces some concerns.
