Additionally, they are not capable of conducting physical examinations or interpreting nuanced clinical signs that are critical in medical diagnosis.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated using an LLM-based judge, which introduces variability and potential inaccuracies in the evaluation. Using an LLM to judge another LLM's medical diagnosis may not capture the subtleties and correctness required for such a critical task.\n\n4. **Success on the Task**: The agent succeeded at diagnosing a complex medical condition (e.g., myocardial infarction in the first example) based on symptoms. This is noteworthy because even though LLMs can generate plausible responses, accurately diagnosing such specific conditions based on symptoms alone is challenging and typically outside the expected capabilities of current LLMs without specialized medical training.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
