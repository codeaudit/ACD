Tighten them as much as you can.\n\n8. **Completely Lower the Car:**\n   - **Fully Lower the Car:** Lower the car completely to the ground and remove the jack.\n   - **Tighten the Lug Nuts Again:** Give the lug nuts another round of tightening with the lug wrench to ensure they are secure.\n\n9. **Final Steps:**\n   - **Replace the Hubcap:** If applicable, put the hubcap or wheel cover back on the spare tire.\n   - **Stow Away Tools and Flat Tire:** Put your tools and the flat tire back in your vehicle.\n   - **Check Tire Pressure:** Ensure the spare tire is properly inflated. Most spare tires are temporary and are not meant for long distances or high speeds.\n\n10. **Drive Safely:**\n    - **Drive to a Repair Shop:** As soon as possible, drive to a professional to have your flat tire repaired or replaced. Remember that spare tires are often not intended for long-term use.\n\nAlways refer to your vehicle's owner manual for specific details related to your car model.",
            "Answer: \nTo change a flat tire on a car, follow these detailed step-by-step instructions:\n\n**Tools and Materials Needed:**\n1. Spare tire\n2. Car jack\n3. Lug wrench\n4. Wheel chocks or heavy object (brick, stone)\n5. Vehicle owner's manual\n6. Gloves (optional)\n7. Flashlight (if needed)\n\n**Safety Precautions:**\n1. Ensure the car is parked on a flat, stable surface away from traffic.\n2. Turn on your hazard lights.\n3. Apply the parking brake.\n4. Place wheel chocks or a heavy object behind the wheels that are not being lifted to prevent the car from rolling.\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Car:**\n   - Park the car on a level surface and activate the hazard lights.\n   - Apply the parking brake and place wheel chocks or heavy objects behind the wheels not being lifted.\n\n2. **Locate the Spare Tire, Jack, and Lug Wrench:**\n   - Refer to the owner's manual if you are unsure where these are located in your vehicle.\n   - Typically, these are found in the trunk, under the floor mat, or in a compartment on the side of the trunk.\n\n3. **Loosen the Lug Nuts:**\n   - Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire. Turn them counterclockwise, but do not remove them completely yet. Loosening them while the car is still on the ground prevents the tire from spinning.\n\n4. **Position the Jack:**\n   - Refer to the owner's manual for the correct jacking points on your vehicle.\n   - Place the jack under the vehicle at the recommended jacking point near the flat tire.\n\n5. **Lift the Vehicle:**\n   - Use the jack to lift the car until the flat tire is about 6 inches off the ground. Make sure the car is stable on the jack before proceeding.\n\n6. **Remove the Lug Nuts and Flat Tire:**\n   - Finish unscrewing the lug nuts and keep them in a safe place.\n   - Carefully remove the flat tire and place it under the car as a precaution in case the jack fails.\n\n7. **Mount the Spare Tire:**\n   - Align the spare tire with the lug bolts and push it onto the wheel hub.\n   - Hand-tighten the lug nuts as much as possible.\n\n8. **Lower the Vehicle:**\n   - Use the jack to slowly lower the car until the spare tire is just touching the ground.\n   - Tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern using the lug wrench. This ensures even tightening.\n\n9. **Fully Lower the Vehicle:**\n   - Lower the car completely to the ground and remove the jack.\n   - Re-tighten the lug nuts in the same star pattern to ensure they are secure.\n\n10. **Store the Tools and Flat Tire:**\n    - Place the flat tire, jack, and lug wrench back in their storage locations.\n    - If the flat tire is repairable, take it to a tire repair shop as soon as possible.\n\n11. **Check the Spare Tire:**\n    - Ensure the spare tire is properly inflated before driving.\n    - Drive to a tire repair shop to have the flat tire repaired or replaced, and to check the condition of the spare tire.\n\nBy following these steps, you can safely and effectively change a flat tire on your car.",

These are straightforward tasks for an LLM given its extensive training data.\n\n3. **Moderate Difficulty**: The task is rated as having moderate difficulty for humans, which likely translates to relatively low difficulty for a well-trained LLM.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` to evaluate the generated instructions based on clarity, logical ordering, and completeness is reasonable. However, the reliability of LLM-based evaluation can sometimes be questioned due to potential biases or misunderstandings in nuances.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the above reasoning, the LLM agent's success in generating detailed procedural instructions is not surprising, as this falls well within the expected capabilities of an LLM. The task is relatively straightforward and does not involve complex reasoning or deep domain-specific knowledge.\n\n**Decision: No**"
