            "Step-by-step Explanation:\n1. First, we need to determine how far the car travels in the first 1.5 hours.\n2. Next, we need to account for the 15-minute break. Since the break does not affect the total travel distance or speed, it will not be included in the distance calculation.\n3. Finally, we need to calculate how far the car travels in the remaining time after the break. To do this, we subtract the time already traveled (1.5 hours) from the total travel time (2.5 hours) to find the remaining travel time.\n\nCalculations:\n1. Distance traveled in the first 1.5 hours:\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 1.5 hours\n   Distance = 90 miles\n\n2. Total travel time is 2.5 hours. The break of 15 minutes (which is 0.25 hours) does not affect the total travel time, so we continue with the remaining time:\n   Remaining time = Total time - Time already traveled\n   Remaining time = 2.5 hours - 1.5 hours\n   Remaining time = 1.0 hour\n\n3. Distance traveled in the remaining 1.0 hour:\n   Distance = Speed \u00d7 Time\n   Distance = 60 miles/hour \u00d7 1.0 hour\n   Distance = 60 miles\n\n4. Total distance traveled:\n   Total distance = Distance in the first 1.5 hours + Distance in the remaining 1.0 hour\n   Total distance = 90 miles + 60 miles\n   Total distance = 150 miles\n\nFinal Answer:\nAnswer: 150 miles",
