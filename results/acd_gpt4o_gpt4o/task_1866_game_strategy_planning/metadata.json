            "1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - As the first player (X), the optimal opening move is to place your mark in the center cell (position 5). This central position offers the highest number of opportunities to create a winning line (four potential lines: three in any direction plus the two diagonals).\n   - As the second player (O), if the opponent chooses the center, take one of the corners (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9). Corners also provide multiple opportunities to create winning lines and can help you block the opponent's strategies.\n\n2. **Mid-game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - Focus on creating two potential lines of three that intersect. This dual-threat forces your opponent to block one line while you can capitalize on the other.\n   - Always be on the lookout to block your opponent's attempts to align three in a row. Prioritize defense if the opponent has two marks aligned with an empty third spot.\n   - Control the corners and edges to increase your winning chances. Corners are crucial as they are part of three winning lines, and edges are part of two.\n\n3. **End-game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - In the end-game, if you have two marks in a row, place your third mark to complete the line and win.\n   - If you cannot win, block any immediate threats from your opponent by placing your mark in the empty cell of their potential winning line.\n   - Aim to create a situation where you have multiple winning lines, forcing your opponent into an impossible position and securing your win.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - If the opponent starts or places a mark in the center, your response should focus on claiming a corner to maximize your chances of creating multiple winning paths.\n   - If the opponent takes a corner, aim for the center or an opposite corner to balance the board and prepare for dual-threat tactics.\n   - Be wary of traps where the opponent sets up two possible winning lines simultaneously. Always prioritize blocking these moves.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - Against a less skilled opponent, you can focus more on offensive strategies, as they are less likely to anticipate and block your dual-threat tactics effectively.\n   - Against a highly skilled opponent, prioritize defense while looking for opportunities to create dual-threats. Skilled opponents will often look to set traps or force you into defensive positions, so maintaining a balanced approach is key.\n   - If the starting position is different (e.g., opponent starts with a non-center move), adapt by taking control of key positions like the center and corners to maintain strategic advantage.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can enhance your chances of winning or securing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe, regardless of your opponent's skill level.",
            "1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - As the first player (X), the optimal opening move is to place an X in the center cell (5). This provides the highest number of potential winning lines (four: two diagonals, one vertical, and one horizontal).\n   - If the center is taken by the opponent (O), place an X in a corner (1, 3, 7, or 9). Corners provide multiple pathways to victory and can force the opponent into a defensive stance.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - Control the center and corners: If you started in the center, aim to occupy the corners next. If you started in a corner, aim for the center.\n   - Create double threats: Position your marks to create two potential ways to win simultaneously. This forces the opponent to block one, leaving the other open for your victory.\n   - Block the opponent's attempts to form lines: Always be vigilant about the opponent's moves and block any two-in-a-row they create.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - Focus on filling lines that have two of your marks with the third cell empty.\n   - If a win is not possible, ensure to block all of the opponent's potential winning moves.\n   - If both players are skilled and it reaches the end-game with no clear winner, aim to fill the remaining cells in a manner that ensures no three-in-a-row for either player, forcing a draw.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - If the opponent starts and places O in the center, respond by taking a corner to maximize your winning lines.\n   - If the opponent starts with a corner, take the center to disrupt their strategy.\n   - If the opponent plays defensively (blocking your moves), use this to your advantage by creating situations where they must block multiple potential winning lines.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Impact of Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions:**\n   - Against a less skilled opponent, prioritize aggressive tactics and capitalize on their mistakes, such as missing opportunities to block your moves.\n   - Against a skilled opponent, a more balanced approach is necessary. Focus on maintaining control of the center and key positions while preventing their winning strategies.\n   - Adapt your strategy based on the opponent's patterns of play. If they favor certain openings or tactics, adjust your moves to counteract effectively.\n   - If you start second, always respond to the first player's move by targeting the center or corner cells to disrupt their strategy. Adapt your moves based on their skill and patterns to maintain control and push for a win or draw.\n\nBy following these strategies and adjusting based on your opponent's actions and skill level, you can significantly improve your chances of winning or at least forcing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe.",

Focus on not making mistakes and forcing a draw if necessary.\n- **Against a Less Skilled Opponent:** Take advantage of any mistakes such as missed blocks or poorly chosen placements. Look for opportunities to create two-way threats that they may overlook.\n- **Different Starting Positions:** Adjust your strategy based on the opponent\u2019s first move. If they vary their opening, adapt by prioritizing blocking and creating flexible lines that can pivot based on their responses.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can maximize your chances of winning or at least securing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe, regardless of your opponent\u2019s skill level.",
            "1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - **Center First:** If you're the first player, placing your mark (X) in the center (position 5) is the best opening move. This positions you to create multiple lines of attack (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and provides the most flexibility.\n   - **Corner First:** If the center is taken by the opponent, placing your mark in one of the corners (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is the next best move. This maximizes your chances to create multiple two-way threats on your next turn.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - **Forks:** Create opportunities to form a \"fork,\" which is a position where you have two potential winning moves and the opponent can only block one.\n   - **Blocking Forks:** Always be on the lookout for potential forks from your opponent and block them immediately.\n   - **Prioritize Winning Moves:** If you have an immediate opportunity to win (three in a row), take it.\n   - **Block Opponent's Winning Moves:** If the opponent has an immediate winning move, block it.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - **Force the Win:** By the end game, you should be able to set up a winning move that the opponent cannot block.\n   - **Secure a Draw:** If winning becomes impossible, focus on ensuring the opponent cannot win either. This might involve blocking their moves and filling any remaining spaces strategically to avoid giving them an advantage.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - **Opponent Takes Center First:** If the opponent starts in the center, respond by taking a corner. This reduces their flexibility and increases your chances of creating multiple threats.\n   - **Opponent Takes a Corner First:** If the opponent starts in a corner, take the center to maximize your control over the game.\n   - **Opponent Takes an Edge First:** If the opponent starts on an edge (non-corner, non-center), take the center first. This forms a strong base for creating multiple attack lines.\n\n5. **Analysis of Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - **Against a Skilled Opponent:** Expect them to block your obvious winning moves and set up forks. Be cautious and try to play defensively to avoid falling into traps. Skilled players often force a draw if both play optimally.\n   - **Against a Less Skilled Opponent:** They might miss opportunities to block your winning moves or set up their own strategic positions. Take advantage of any mistakes and aim to create forks that they might not see.\n   - **Different Starting Positions:** Whether starting first or second, adapt your strategy based on the initial move. Always aim to control the center or create multiple potential lines of attack.\n\nBy following a structured approach and adapting based on the opponent\u2019s actions and skill level, you can increase your chances of winning or at least securing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe.",
            "1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - **Center Move (if you are the first player):** Placing your mark in the center (position 5) is a strong opening move because it maximizes your control over the board. From the center, you can potentially complete a row, column, or diagonal.\n   - **Corner Move (if you are the second player):** If the opponent starts with the center, placing your mark in any corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is advantageous. Corners provide multiple pathways for creating rows, columns, or diagonals.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - **Fork Creation:** Try to create opportunities where you can form two potential winning lines simultaneously (a fork). This forces your opponent to defend in two places at once, which is impossible.\n   - **Block Opponent's Forks:** Always be vigilant to block your opponent's potential forks. If the opponent has a chance to create a fork, prioritize blocking it over making your own move.\n   - **Control the Center and Corners:** Maintain control over the center and corners, as these positions provide the most options for creating winning lines.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - **Immediate Win:** If you have two marks aligned and the third cell is empty, place your mark there to win.\n   - **Block Opponent\u2019s Win:** If the opponent has two marks aligned and the third cell is empty, place your mark there to block them.\n   - **Force a Draw:** If winning is not possible, focus on blocking all of the opponent\u2019s winning opportunities to force a draw.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - **Opponent Takes Center First:** If the opponent starts with the center, place your mark in a corner to maximize your future options.\n   - **Opponent Takes a Corner First:** If the opponent starts with a corner, take the center to block their most powerful position.\n   - **Opponent Takes an Edge First:** If the opponent starts with an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8), take the center to control the board and create multiple winning paths.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - **Against a Skilled Opponent:** Skilled opponents will likely anticipate your strategies and try to counter them. In this case, focus on maintaining control of the center and corners while being vigilant about forks and blocks.\n   - **Against a Less Skilled Opponent:** Less skilled opponents may make mistakes, such as missing potential wins or failing to block your forks. In this scenario, capitalize on their mistakes by creating and exploiting forks and ensuring you block their potential wins.\n   - **Different Starting Positions:** If the game rules change and you start from a different position, adjust your strategy to prioritize control of the most influential cells (center and corners). Adaptation and flexibility are key in these scenarios.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, you can maximize your chances of winning or at least securing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe."

            "**1. Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n- **Center Column First Move:** Start by placing a disc in the center column (column 4). This central position gives you the most flexibility to create horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.\n- **Second Move Response:** If playing second, try to place your first disc directly above the opponent\u2019s disc in the center column if possible. Otherwise, place it in one of the adjacent columns (3 or 5) to maintain control of the center.\n\n**2. Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n- **Control the Center:** Continue to prioritize the center columns (3, 4, and 5). Controlling the center allows you to branch out in multiple directions and makes it harder for your opponent to block your potential connections.\n- **Build Multiple Threats:** Aim to create multiple lines of three discs that can turn into a winning move. This way, your opponent can only block one at a time, increasing your chances to win.\n- **Defensive Play:** Pay close attention to your opponent\u2019s moves and block potential lines of four discs. Always be on the lookout for any three-in-a-row formations by your opponent.\n\n**3. End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n- **Force Moves:** If you have multiple potential winning moves, try to force your opponent into a position where they have to block one, allowing you to complete another line of four on your next turn.\n- **Avoid Giving Away Winning Moves:** Be careful not to place your disc in a way that sets up your opponent for a win on their next turn. Always consider the implications of each move you make.\n- **Drawing the Game:** If winning seems unlikely, focus on blocking all of your opponent\u2019s potential winning moves to force a draw.\n\n**4. Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n- **Blocking Center Control:** Expect your opponent to contest the center columns. Be prepared to block their moves directly above or adjacent to your center discs.\n- **Immediate Threats:** Opponents often try to create immediate threats by forming lines of three discs. Always look ahead to see potential connections and block them preemptively.\n- **Diagonal Traps:** Be wary of diagonal traps where an opponent sets up two potential diagonal wins. Focus on disrupting their pattern early.\n\n**5. Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent\u2019s Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n- **Against Novices:** Novice players might not focus on the center or strategic blocks. Use this to your advantage by dominating the central columns and setting up multiple threats.\n- **Against Experienced Players:** Experienced players will contest the center and look for complex win patterns. Be more cautious and deliberate with your moves, focusing on blocking and creating multiple threats.\n- **Different Starting Positions:** If you start second, your strategy should focus more on reactive play initially, blocking the opponent\u2019s first move advantage and then shifting to control the center as soon as possible.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into your gameplay, you can develop a well-rounded strategy for Connect Four that adapts to different situations and opponent skill levels.",
            "1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - Start by placing your first disc in the center column (column 4). This move maximizes your reach for potential vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections. The center column provides the highest number of potential ways to connect four discs.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - Focus on creating multiple threats simultaneously. Aim to build discs in such a way that you have more than one potential Connect Four opportunity.\n   - Control the center of the board by placing discs in columns 3, 4, and 5. This positioning enhances your ability to create and block vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.\n   - Block your opponent's attempts to form Connect Four by placing your discs strategically, especially if they are building sequences of three discs.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - If you are close to winning, try to create a situation where you have two potential winning moves that your opponent cannot block simultaneously.\n   - If you cannot win, focus on blocking your opponent's winning moves while setting up potential future winning opportunities.\n   - Pay close attention to the remaining empty spaces and anticipate the potential moves your opponent can make. Use these insights to place your discs in positions that either block their winning moves or create opportunities for yourself.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - Watch for your opponent trying to take control of the center column and counter by placing your discs there as well.\n   - Be aware of common tactics such as attempting to build diagonals from the corners or edges of the board. Place your discs to interrupt these sequences early.\n   - If your opponent is focusing on one side of the board, consider spreading your discs on the opposite side to create alternative threats and force them to divide their attention.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - Against a less skilled opponent, you can afford to be more aggressive and focus on building multiple potential Connect Four opportunities.\n   - Against a highly skilled opponent, prioritize a more balanced approach, focusing on both offense (creating opportunities) and defense (blocking their potential Connect Fours).\n   - If you do not start first, adapt by mirroring the opponent's center column control strategy and look for opportunities to disrupt their sequences while building your own.\n\nBy maintaining flexibility and adapting to the game\u2019s flow, you can increase your chances of securing a win or forcing a draw in Connect Four.",
            "1. Key Opening Moves and their Rationale:\n   - First move should be to drop a disc into the center column (column 4). This move maximizes your reach for future connections since the center column is part of more potential winning alignments (both horizontally and diagonally) than any other column.\n   - If the opponent starts, respond by placing your disc directly above their disc in the center column if possible, to contest the central control.\n\n2. Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:\n   - Focus on building multiple threats simultaneously. This means setting up a scenario where you are one move away from winning in more than one direction.\n   - Aim to control the middle columns (columns 3 through 5) as they provide the most options for forming vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.\n   - Place discs in such a way that you have defensive options to block your opponent's potential connections while still advancing your strategy.\n\n3. End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:\n   - In the end-game, pay close attention to the number of empty slots remaining and prioritize moves that either directly lead to a win or block the opponent from winning.\n   - When you are ahead, force your opponent into making defensive moves by constantly creating threats.\n   - If a win seems unattainable, focus on creating a stalemate by ensuring that every move you make blocks a potential winning move for your opponent.\n\n4. Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:\n   - Be vigilant about the opponent's attempts to create three-in-a-row setups and block them preemptively.\n   - If the opponent is also heavily focused on the center, try to divert their focus by creating threats on the wings (columns 1, 2, 6, and 7) while maintaining your control of the center.\n   - Watch for diagonal threats, as they can often be overlooked. Make sure to block any diagonal three-in-a-row setups as soon as you notice them.\n\n5. Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions:\n   - Against a less skilled opponent, focus on basic strategies like maintaining center control and building multiple threats, as they are more likely to miss critical defensive moves.\n   - Against a highly skilled opponent, be prepared for deeper strategic play, including more complex setups and counter-plays. In such cases, try to anticipate their long-term strategies and disrupt their plans early.\n   - If starting from a non-standard position (e.g., an already partially filled board), first assess the current threats and opportunities for both players and adapt your strategy accordingly. Prioritize immediate threats and then revert to your standard positioning tactics.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can maximize your chances of winning in Connect Four, adapt to different levels of opponent skill, and handle various starting scenarios effectively.",
            "1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - Start by placing your first disc in the center column (column 4). This is advantageous because it maximizes your potential to create vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.\n   - If your opponent does not contest the center column, continue to build vertically in this column to establish a strong central presence.\n   - If your opponent contests the center column, branch out to the adjacent columns (columns 3 and 5) to maintain control of the center while also preparing for horizontal and diagonal connections.\n\n2. **Mid-game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - Focus on creating multiple threats simultaneously. For example, place your discs in positions that can contribute to more than one potential line of four.\n   - Maintain flexibility by avoiding over-committing to a single line unless it is a guaranteed win. This makes it harder for your opponent to block all your potential winning moves.\n   - Pay attention to your opponent\u2019s moves and identify their potential winning lines early. Block their attempts to connect four while continuing to build your own lines.\n   - Utilize the edges of the board to create additional threats. The corners and sides can be powerful positions if used strategically.\n\n3. **End-game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - As the game progresses and the board fills up, focus on creating traps where your opponent has to choose between blocking one of two possible winning moves for you.\n   - If winning seems unlikely, shift your strategy to force a draw by ensuring that no four-in-a-row is possible for either player. This involves careful placement to block all potential winning lines.\n   - Control the tempo of the game by managing the pace at which you and your opponent place discs. Sometimes, it is beneficial to delay certain moves to create more openings for yourself later.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-strategies:**\n   - Anticipate that opponents will also aim for the center column. Be prepared to contest it and establish a strong central presence early in the game.\n   - Watch for diagonal threats, as these can be less obvious but equally dangerous. Counter diagonal threats by placing discs in positions that block multiple potential diagonal connections.\n   - If your opponent tries to build vertically in one column, place your discs to block their progress while simultaneously creating horizontal or diagonal threats of your own.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - Against a skilled opponent, expect more sophisticated strategies and be prepared to adapt quickly. Focus on creating multiple threats and maintaining flexibility in your play.\n   - Against a less experienced opponent, basic strategies like controlling the center and blocking obvious threats will often suffice to secure a win.\n   - If starting positions are different (e.g., a handicapped game), adjust your initial moves to optimize control based on the given constraints. For instance, if you start with fewer initial discs, prioritize securing the center as soon as possible.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can improve your chances of winning at Connect Four by making informed decisions at each stage of the game.",

            "Answer: \n\n1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - **Center First:** If you're the first player, placing your mark (X) in the center (position 5) is the best opening move. This positions you to create multiple lines of attack (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and provides the most flexibility.\n   - **Corner First:** If the center is taken by the opponent, placing your mark in one of the corners (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is the next best move. This maximizes your chances to create multiple two-way threats on your next turn.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - **Forks:** Create opportunities to form a \"fork,\" which is a position where you have two potential winning moves and the opponent can only block one.\n   - **Blocking Forks:** Always be on the lookout for potential forks from your opponent and block them immediately.\n   - **Prioritize Winning Moves:** If you have an immediate opportunity to win (three in a row), take it.\n   - **Block Opponent's Winning Moves:** If the opponent has an immediate winning move, block it.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - **Force the Win:** By the end game, you should be able to set up a winning move that the opponent cannot block.\n   - **Secure a Draw:** If winning becomes impossible, focus on ensuring the opponent cannot win either. This might involve blocking their moves and filling any remaining spaces strategically to avoid giving them an advantage.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - **Opponent Takes Center First:** If the opponent starts in the center, respond by taking a corner. This reduces their flexibility and increases your chances of creating multiple threats.\n   - **Opponent Takes a Corner First:** If the opponent starts in a corner, take the center to maximize your control over the game.\n   - **Opponent Takes an Edge First:** If the opponent starts on an edge (non-corner, non-center), take the center first. This forms a strong base for creating multiple attack lines.\n\n5. **Analysis of Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - **Against a Skilled Opponent:** Expect them to block your obvious winning moves and set up forks. Be cautious and try to play defensively to avoid falling into traps. Skilled players often force a draw if both play optimally.\n   - **Against a Less Skilled Opponent:** They might miss opportunities to block your winning moves or set up their own strategic positions. Take advantage of any mistakes and aim to create forks that they might not see.\n   - **Different Starting Positions:** Whether starting first or second, adapt your strategy based on the initial move. Always aim to control the center or create multiple potential lines of attack.\n\nBy following a structured approach and adapting based on the opponent\u2019s actions and skill level, you can increase your chances of winning or at least securing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe.",
            "Answer: \n1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - **Center Move (if you are the first player):** Placing your mark in the center (position 5) is a strong opening move because it maximizes your control over the board. From the center, you can potentially complete a row, column, or diagonal.\n   - **Corner Move (if you are the second player):** If the opponent starts with the center, placing your mark in any corner (positions 1, 3, 7, or 9) is advantageous. Corners provide multiple pathways for creating rows, columns, or diagonals.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - **Fork Creation:** Try to create opportunities where you can form two potential winning lines simultaneously (a fork). This forces your opponent to defend in two places at once, which is impossible.\n   - **Block Opponent's Forks:** Always be vigilant to block your opponent's potential forks. If the opponent has a chance to create a fork, prioritize blocking it over making your own move.\n   - **Control the Center and Corners:** Maintain control over the center and corners, as these positions provide the most options for creating winning lines.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - **Immediate Win:** If you have two marks aligned and the third cell is empty, place your mark there to win.\n   - **Block Opponent\u2019s Win:** If the opponent has two marks aligned and the third cell is empty, place your mark there to block them.\n   - **Force a Draw:** If winning is not possible, focus on blocking all of the opponent\u2019s winning opportunities to force a draw.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - **Opponent Takes Center First:** If the opponent starts with the center, place your mark in a corner to maximize your future options.\n   - **Opponent Takes a Corner First:** If the opponent starts with a corner, take the center to block their most powerful position.\n   - **Opponent Takes an Edge First:** If the opponent starts with an edge (positions 2, 4, 6, or 8), take the center to control the board and create multiple winning paths.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - **Against a Skilled Opponent:** Skilled opponents will likely anticipate your strategies and try to counter them. In this case, focus on maintaining control of the center and corners while being vigilant about forks and blocks.\n   - **Against a Less Skilled Opponent:** Less skilled opponents may make mistakes, such as missing potential wins or failing to block your forks. In this scenario, capitalize on their mistakes by creating and exploiting forks and ensuring you block their potential wins.\n   - **Different Starting Positions:** If the game rules change and you start from a different position, adjust your strategy to prioritize control of the most influential cells (center and corners). Adaptation and flexibility are key in these scenarios.\n\nBy adhering to these strategies, you can maximize your chances of winning or at least securing a draw in Tic-Tac-Toe."

            "Answer: \n\n**1. Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n- **Center Column First Move:** Start by placing a disc in the center column (column 4). This central position gives you the most flexibility to create horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.\n- **Second Move Response:** If playing second, try to place your first disc directly above the opponent\u2019s disc in the center column if possible. Otherwise, place it in one of the adjacent columns (3 or 5) to maintain control of the center.\n\n**2. Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n- **Control the Center:** Continue to prioritize the center columns (3, 4, and 5). Controlling the center allows you to branch out in multiple directions and makes it harder for your opponent to block your potential connections.\n- **Build Multiple Threats:** Aim to create multiple lines of three discs that can turn into a winning move. This way, your opponent can only block one at a time, increasing your chances to win.\n- **Defensive Play:** Pay close attention to your opponent\u2019s moves and block potential lines of four discs. Always be on the lookout for any three-in-a-row formations by your opponent.\n\n**3. End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n- **Force Moves:** If you have multiple potential winning moves, try to force your opponent into a position where they have to block one, allowing you to complete another line of four on your next turn.\n- **Avoid Giving Away Winning Moves:** Be careful not to place your disc in a way that sets up your opponent for a win on their next turn. Always consider the implications of each move you make.\n- **Drawing the Game:** If winning seems unlikely, focus on blocking all of your opponent\u2019s potential winning moves to force a draw.\n\n**4. Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n- **Blocking Center Control:** Expect your opponent to contest the center columns. Be prepared to block their moves directly above or adjacent to your center discs.\n- **Immediate Threats:** Opponents often try to create immediate threats by forming lines of three discs. Always look ahead to see potential connections and block them preemptively.\n- **Diagonal Traps:** Be wary of diagonal traps where an opponent sets up two potential diagonal wins. Focus on disrupting their pattern early.\n\n**5. Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent\u2019s Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n- **Against Novices:** Novice players might not focus on the center or strategic blocks. Use this to your advantage by dominating the central columns and setting up multiple threats.\n- **Against Experienced Players:** Experienced players will contest the center and look for complex win patterns. Be more cautious and deliberate with your moves, focusing on blocking and creating multiple threats.\n- **Different Starting Positions:** If you start second, your strategy should focus more on reactive play initially, blocking the opponent\u2019s first move advantage and then shifting to control the center as soon as possible.\n\nBy incorporating these elements into your gameplay, you can develop a well-rounded strategy for Connect Four that adapts to different situations and opponent skill levels.",
            "Answer: \n1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - Start by placing your first disc in the center column (column 4). This move maximizes your reach for potential vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections. The center column provides the highest number of potential ways to connect four discs.\n\n2. **Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - Focus on creating multiple threats simultaneously. Aim to build discs in such a way that you have more than one potential Connect Four opportunity.\n   - Control the center of the board by placing discs in columns 3, 4, and 5. This positioning enhances your ability to create and block vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.\n   - Block your opponent's attempts to form Connect Four by placing your discs strategically, especially if they are building sequences of three discs.\n\n3. **End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - If you are close to winning, try to create a situation where you have two potential winning moves that your opponent cannot block simultaneously.\n   - If you cannot win, focus on blocking your opponent's winning moves while setting up potential future winning opportunities.\n   - Pay close attention to the remaining empty spaces and anticipate the potential moves your opponent can make. Use these insights to place your discs in positions that either block their winning moves or create opportunities for yourself.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:**\n   - Watch for your opponent trying to take control of the center column and counter by placing your discs there as well.\n   - Be aware of common tactics such as attempting to build diagonals from the corners or edges of the board. Place your discs to interrupt these sequences early.\n   - If your opponent is focusing on one side of the board, consider spreading your discs on the opposite side to create alternative threats and force them to divide their attention.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - Against a less skilled opponent, you can afford to be more aggressive and focus on building multiple potential Connect Four opportunities.\n   - Against a highly skilled opponent, prioritize a more balanced approach, focusing on both offense (creating opportunities) and defense (blocking their potential Connect Fours).\n   - If you do not start first, adapt by mirroring the opponent's center column control strategy and look for opportunities to disrupt their sequences while building your own.\n\nBy maintaining flexibility and adapting to the game\u2019s flow, you can increase your chances of securing a win or forcing a draw in Connect Four.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. Key Opening Moves and their Rationale:\n   - First move should be to drop a disc into the center column (column 4). This move maximizes your reach for future connections since the center column is part of more potential winning alignments (both horizontally and diagonally) than any other column.\n   - If the opponent starts, respond by placing your disc directly above their disc in the center column if possible, to contest the central control.\n\n2. Mid-Game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:\n   - Focus on building multiple threats simultaneously. This means setting up a scenario where you are one move away from winning in more than one direction.\n   - Aim to control the middle columns (columns 3 through 5) as they provide the most options for forming vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.\n   - Place discs in such a way that you have defensive options to block your opponent's potential connections while still advancing your strategy.\n\n3. End-Game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:\n   - In the end-game, pay close attention to the number of empty slots remaining and prioritize moves that either directly lead to a win or block the opponent from winning.\n   - When you are ahead, force your opponent into making defensive moves by constantly creating threats.\n   - If a win seems unattainable, focus on creating a stalemate by ensuring that every move you make blocks a potential winning move for your opponent.\n\n4. Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-Strategies:\n   - Be vigilant about the opponent's attempts to create three-in-a-row setups and block them preemptively.\n   - If the opponent is also heavily focused on the center, try to divert their focus by creating threats on the wings (columns 1, 2, 6, and 7) while maintaining your control of the center.\n   - Watch for diagonal threats, as they can often be overlooked. Make sure to block any diagonal three-in-a-row setups as soon as you notice them.\n\n5. Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions:\n   - Against a less skilled opponent, focus on basic strategies like maintaining center control and building multiple threats, as they are more likely to miss critical defensive moves.\n   - Against a highly skilled opponent, be prepared for deeper strategic play, including more complex setups and counter-plays. In such cases, try to anticipate their long-term strategies and disrupt their plans early.\n   - If starting from a non-standard position (e.g., an already partially filled board), first assess the current threats and opportunities for both players and adapt your strategy accordingly. Prioritize immediate threats and then revert to your standard positioning tactics.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can maximize your chances of winning in Connect Four, adapt to different levels of opponent skill, and handle various starting scenarios effectively.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - Start by placing your first disc in the center column (column 4). This is advantageous because it maximizes your potential to create vertical, horizontal, and diagonal connections.\n   - If your opponent does not contest the center column, continue to build vertically in this column to establish a strong central presence.\n   - If your opponent contests the center column, branch out to the adjacent columns (columns 3 and 5) to maintain control of the center while also preparing for horizontal and diagonal connections.\n\n2. **Mid-game Tactics and Positioning Strategies:**\n   - Focus on creating multiple threats simultaneously. For example, place your discs in positions that can contribute to more than one potential line of four.\n   - Maintain flexibility by avoiding over-committing to a single line unless it is a guaranteed win. This makes it harder for your opponent to block all your potential winning moves.\n   - Pay attention to your opponent\u2019s moves and identify their potential winning lines early. Block their attempts to connect four while continuing to build your own lines.\n   - Utilize the edges of the board to create additional threats. The corners and sides can be powerful positions if used strategically.\n\n3. **End-game Strategies to Secure a Win or Force a Draw:**\n   - As the game progresses and the board fills up, focus on creating traps where your opponent has to choose between blocking one of two possible winning moves for you.\n   - If winning seems unlikely, shift your strategy to force a draw by ensuring that no four-in-a-row is possible for either player. This involves careful placement to block all potential winning lines.\n   - Control the tempo of the game by managing the pace at which you and your opponent place discs. Sometimes, it is beneficial to delay certain moves to create more openings for yourself later.\n\n4. **Anticipation of Common Opponent Moves and Counter-strategies:**\n   - Anticipate that opponents will also aim for the center column. Be prepared to contest it and establish a strong central presence early in the game.\n   - Watch for diagonal threats, as these can be less obvious but equally dangerous. Counter diagonal threats by placing discs in positions that block multiple potential diagonal connections.\n   - If your opponent tries to build vertically in one column, place your discs to block their progress while simultaneously creating horizontal or diagonal threats of your own.\n\n5. **Analysis of the Potential Impact of the Opponent's Skill Level or Different Starting Positions on Your Strategy:**\n   - Against a skilled opponent, expect more sophisticated strategies and be prepared to adapt quickly. Focus on creating multiple threats and maintaining flexibility in your play.\n   - Against a less experienced opponent, basic strategies like controlling the center and blocking obvious threats will often suffice to secure a win.\n   - If starting positions are different (e.g., a handicapped game), adjust your initial moves to optimize control based on the given constraints. For instance, if you start with fewer initial discs, prioritize securing the center as soon as possible.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can improve your chances of winning at Connect Four by making informed decisions at each stage of the game.",
            "Answer: \n\n1. **Key Opening Moves and Their Rationale:**\n   - **Center Column Dominance:** Start by placing a disc in the center column (column 4).
