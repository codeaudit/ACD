            "To solve this spatial puzzle, we need to identify a pattern in the sequence of shapes provided:\n\n1. Circle\n2. Square\n3. Triangle\n4. Hexagon\n5. Pentagon\n6. Octagon\n\nFirst, we observe the number of sides or vertices of each shape:\n- Circle: 0 sides (or infinite, depending on interpretation, but for simplicity, we can consider it as 0)\n- Square: 4 sides\n- Triangle: 3 sides\n- Hexagon: 6 sides\n- Pentagon: 5 sides\n- Octagon: 8 sides\n\nThe sequence does not follow a simple numeric progression based on the number of sides. However, if we re-arrange the sequence based on the number of sides, we notice the following:\n- Circle (0 sides)\n- Triangle (3 sides)\n- Square (4 sides)\n- Pentagon (5 sides)\n- Hexagon (6 sides)\n- Octagon (8 sides)\n\nGiven the current sequence progression, the shape that fits into the missing spot to continue the pattern of increasing number of sides is the shape with 7 sides. This shape is a heptagon.\n\nAnswer: Missing shape: heptagon",
            "To solve the puzzle, we need to analyze the sequence of shapes given: circle, square, triangle, hexagon, pentagon, octagon.\n\nFirst, let's list the number of sides for each shape:\n- Circle: 0 sides\n- Square: 4 sides\n- Triangle: 3 sides\n- Hexagon: 6 sides\n- Pentagon: 5 sides\n- Octagon: 8 sides\n\nThe sequence of the number of sides is: 0, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8.\n\nWe observe that the numbers alternate between even and odd:\n- 0 (even)\n- 4 (even)\n- 3 (odd)\n- 6 (even)\n- 5 (odd)\n- 8 (even)\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next shape should have an odd number of sides. The sequence of odd numbers in the pattern is 3, 5, so the next odd number following 5 is 7.\n\nTherefore, the shape with 7 sides is a heptagon.\n\nAnswer: Missing shape: heptagon",

Triangle (3 sides)\n4. Hexagon (6 sides)\n5. Pentagon (5 sides)\n6. Octagon (8 sides)\n\nWhen looking at the sequence of sides in each shape, we have: 0 (circle), 4 (square), 3 (triangle), 6 (hexagon), 5 (pentagon), 8 (octagon). The pattern doesn't follow a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, but it is alternating between even and odd numbers of sides:\n\n- Circle (0 sides) - even\n- Square (4 sides) - even\n- Triangle (3 sides) - odd\n- Hexagon (6 sides) - even\n- Pentagon (5 sides) - odd\n- Octagon (8 sides) - even\n\nFollowing this alternating even-odd pattern, the next shape should have an odd number of sides.
