LLMs are inherently text-based and do not have a built-in visual processing capability.\n\n2. **Expected Capabilities**: LLMs are excellent at understanding and generating text, but they typically struggle with tasks that require visual-spatial reasoning without additional training or auxiliary models (like vision transformers). Describing geometric transformations accurately could be challenging for them because it involves a mental manipulation of shapes and an understanding of spatial relationships.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used for scoring, which relies on another LLM to evaluate the response based on given criteria. This introduces a layer of subjectivity and potential inaccuracies, as an LLM judge might not perfectly understand or evaluate spatial descriptions due to similar limitations in visual-spatial reasoning.\n\n4. **Success of the Agent**: Given the complexity of the task and the typical limitations of LLMs in handling visual-spatial reasoning, an LLM successfully completing this task would be quite surprising.\n\nDecision: Yes"
