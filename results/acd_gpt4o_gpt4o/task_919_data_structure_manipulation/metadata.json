            "To delete the element 15 from the given binary search tree, we need to follow the deletion process specific to binary search trees. The steps to delete a node with two children (such as node 15 in this case) involve finding the in-order successor or predecessor to replace the node, and then deleting the in-order successor or predecessor. \n\nHere\u2019s the initial structure of the binary search tree based on the inserted elements:\n\n```\n        10\n       /  \\\n      5   15\n     / \\  / \\\n    3  7 12 18\n```\n\nTo delete the node with the value 15:\n1. Find the in-order successor of 15. The in-order successor is the smallest node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted. Here, the right subtree of 15 is the subtree rooted at 18.\n2. The in-order successor is 18 because it is the smallest value in the right subtree of 15.\n3. Replace the value of node 15 with the value of its in-order successor, which is 18.\n4. Remove node 18 from the tree.\n\nAfter replacing 15 with 18 and deleting the original node 18, the tree structure is altered as follows:\n\n```\n        10\n       /  \\\n      5   18\n     / \\  /\n    3  7 12\n```\n\nLet's describe the resulting structure in detail:\n\n- The root of the tree remains the same with a value of 10.\n- The left child of the root is still 5, and it has two children: 3 (left child) and 7 (right child).\n- The right child of the root, which was initially 15, is now replaced by 18.\n- The new right child, 18, has one child, which is 12 (left child), and no right child.\n- Nodes 3, 7, and 12 have no children, remaining as leaf nodes.\n\nIn summary, the binary search tree after deleting the element 15 has 10 as the root with a left subtree containing nodes 5, 3, and 7, and a right subtree containing nodes 18 and 12. The tree maintains the binary search tree property where each left child is less than its parent node, and each right child is greater than its parent node.",

The node with the value 15 has two children (12 and 18). In such cases, we find the in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree), which is 18 in this case, and replace the node to be deleted with the in-order successor's value. After replacing, we remove the in-order successor node, which is a leaf node and can be removed directly.\n\nAfter replacing the value of node 15 with 18 and removing the leaf node 18, the tree structure becomes:\n\n```\n       10\n      /  \\\n     5   18\n    / \\  /\n   3  7 12\n```\n\nIn this final tree structure:\n- The root node is 10.\n- The left child of the root is 5, which has two children: 3 (left) and 7 (right).\n- The right child of the root is now 18, which has one left child: 12.\n\nThis resulting tree retains the properties of a binary search tree, where each left child node is smaller than its parent, and each right child node is larger than its parent.",

When a node with two children is deleted, it is typically replaced by its in-order successor (the smallest node in its right subtree) or its in-order predecessor (the largest node in its left subtree). In this case, the in-order successor of the node 15 is 18. Thus, we replace 15 with 18 and then delete the original node 18, which is a leaf node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1.
