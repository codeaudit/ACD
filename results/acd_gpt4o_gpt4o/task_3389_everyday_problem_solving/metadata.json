Given the previous tasks, I noticed that while many tasks focus on creativity, reasoning, and spatial understanding, there hasn't been a deep dive into practical problem-solving in real-world contexts. \n\nI propose a task family that focuses on \"everyday problem-solving\" where the agent needs to solve common, practical challenges that one might encounter in day-to-day life.

As a last resort, consider breaking a small window or door to gain entry, but be aware of the cost and effort to repair the damage.",
            "Answer: \n1. **Check for an Unlocked Entry Point**: Walk around your house and check if any doors or windows are unlocked. Sometimes you might forget to lock a door or window which can provide easy access.\n\n2. **Contact a Household Member**: If you live with someone else, try to contact them to see if they can come home and let you in. This could be a family member, roommate, or partner.\n\n3. **Call a Friend or Neighbor**: If you have given a spare key to a trusted friend or neighbor, contact them to help you get inside.\n\n4. **Use a Hidden Spare Key**: If you have a hidden spare key somewhere outside (under a mat, in a plant pot, etc.), retrieve it and use it to unlock the door.\n\n5. **Use a Credit Card**: If you have a door without a deadbolt, you might be able to use a credit card to slide the latch open. This method works best with spring bolt locks but should be used with caution to avoid damage.\n\n6. **Contact a Locksmith**: If all else fails, call a professional locksmith. They can unlock your door without causing damage and help you regain access.\n\n7. **Break a Window (Last Resort)**: If you need to get inside urgently and no other option is available, you might consider breaking a small window to reach inside and unlock the door from the inside. This should be a last resort due to the cost and danger involved.",
            "Answer: \n1. Check for any unlocked doors or windows: Sometimes a door or window may have been left unlocked by accident.\n\n2. Contact a family member or roommate: If you share the house with someone, try to get in touch with them to see if they can let you in.\n\n3. Use a hidden spare key: If you have a spare key hidden somewhere outside, retrieve it and use it to unlock the door.\n\n4. Call a trusted neighbor or friend: See if they can help you with tools, a phone, or a place to wait.\n\n5. Contact a locksmith: If none of the above options work, call a professional locksmith who can help you regain access to your home.\n\n6. Use a credit card or similar object: For older doors with simple locks, you might be able to slide a credit card between the door and the frame to unlock it.\n\n7. Remove the door knob: If you have access to tools, you might be able to remove the door knob and gain entry.\n\n8. Check if you have access to a garage door: If your garage door has a keypad or you have a remote in your car, you might be able to enter through the garage.\n\n9. Consider climbing through a window: If it is safe to do so, you might be able to climb through an open window.\n\n10. As a last resort, break a window: If there is an urgent need to get inside (e.g., a pet or person in danger), and all other options have failed, consider breaking a window. Ensure it is a small, low-cost window if possible."

They can generate contextually relevant and feasible solutions to everyday problems by leveraging their extensive training data, which includes a wide range of practical situations.\n\n2. **Task Complexity**: The problems presented in the task family are moderately difficult and involve common scenarios (e.g., being locked out of the house, low phone battery). These scenarios are within the realm of knowledge that LLMs are typically trained on. \n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is automatically scored using an LLM-based evaluation (`eval_with_llm_judge`). If the LLM judge is reliable, it will accurately assess the feasibility and practicality of the solutions provided.\n\nConsidering these points, the fact that the LLM agent succeeded in solving the task is not surprising. The problems are well within the capabilities of modern LLMs, and the evaluation method is designed to assess the same kind of practical reasoning the agent is expected to perform.\n\n**Decision: No**"
