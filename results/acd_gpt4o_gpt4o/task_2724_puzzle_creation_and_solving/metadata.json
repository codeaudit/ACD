Each of them makes a statement about the number of candies, but only one of them is telling the truth.\n\n1. Alice says, \"There are exactly 50 candies in the jar.\"\n2. Bob says, \"There are more than 50 candies in the jar.\"\n3. Charlie says, \"There are fewer than 50 candies in the jar.\"\n\nGiven that exactly one of them is telling the truth, determine the exact number of candies in the jar.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet's analyze the statements:\n- If Alice is telling the truth (there are exactly 50 candies), then both Bob and Charlie must be lying. This means:\n  - Bob's statement that there are more than 50 candies is false, which is true if there are exactly 50 candies.\n  - Charlie's statement that there are fewer than 50 candies is false, which is true if there are exactly 50 candies.\n  Therefore, if Alice is telling the truth, the statements of Bob and Charlie being false align with the puzzle's conditions.\n\nThis means Alice's statement is the only possible truth, and therefore, the exact number of candies in the jar is 50.\n\nAnswer: There are exactly 50 candies in the jar.",
            "Puzzle: \n\nFour friends - Alice, Bob, Claire, and David - each have a different favorite color: red, blue, green, and yellow. They also each have a unique pet: cat, dog, bird, and fish. Use the following clues to determine each person's favorite color and their pet.\n\n1. Alice's favorite color is not red.\n2. The person who likes blue has a cat.\n3. David has a dog.\n4. Claire's favorite color is either green or yellow.\n5. Bob's favorite color is yellow.\n6. The person who has a bird likes red.\n\nSolution:\n\nFrom clue 5, we know Bob's favorite color is yellow.\n\nFrom clue 1, Alice's favorite color is not red, so it must be blue, green, or yellow. Since Bob's favorite color is yellow, Alice's favorite color must be blue or green.\n\nFrom clue 2, the person who likes blue has a cat. Since Alice's favorite color is either blue or green and Bob's favorite color is yellow, Alice's favorite color must be blue, and she must have a cat.\n\nFrom clue 3, David has a dog. \n\nFrom clue 4, Claire's favorite color is either green or yellow. Since Bob's favorite color is yellow, Claire's favorite color must be green.\n\nFrom clue 6, the person who has a bird likes red.

            "Puzzle: \n\nYou are a detective investigating a case where a valuable artifact is stolen from a museum. There are four suspects: Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diana. Each of them makes a statement:\n\n1. Alice says, \"I did not steal the artifact. Bob did.\"\n2. Bob says, \"I did not steal the artifact. Diana did.\"\n3. Charlie says, \"Diana did not steal the artifact.\"\n4. Diana says, \"Bob is lying.\"\n\nYou know that exactly one of the suspects is telling the truth while the other three are lying. Who stole the artifact?\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this puzzle, analyze the statements made by each suspect and identify the one statement that is true while ensuring that the other three statements are false.\n\n1. If Alice is telling the truth, then Bob stole the artifact. However, if Alice is telling the truth, then Bob's statement must be false. This would mean Diana did not steal the artifact, which contradicts Alice's statement that Bob did. Therefore, Alice cannot be telling the truth.\n\n2. If Bob is telling the truth, then Diana stole the artifact. If Bob is telling the truth, Diana's statement that Bob is lying would be false, meaning Bob is not lying. This contradiction indicates that Bob cannot be telling the truth.\n\n3. If Charlie is telling the truth, then Diana did not steal the artifact. If Charlie is telling the truth, then Alice's statement and Bob's statement must be false. If Alice's statement is false, then Bob did not steal the artifact. If Bob's statement is false, then Diana did not steal the artifact. Both conditions are consistent with Charlie telling the truth. Hence, Charlie's statement could be true.\n\n4. If Diana is telling the truth, then Bob is lying. If Diana is telling the truth, then Bob's statement that Diana stole the artifact must be false. However, if Diana is telling the truth, then Charlie's statement that Diana did not steal the artifact would also be true, which means there would be more than one true statement. Therefore, Diana cannot be telling the truth.\n\nSince Charlie is the only one whose statement can be true without contradiction, Charlie is telling the truth, and Diana did not steal the artifact. Given that only one statement is true and the other three are false:\n\n- Alice's false statement means Bob did not steal the artifact.\n- Bob's false statement means Diana did not steal the artifact.\n- Charlie's true statement means Diana did not steal the artifact.\n- Diana's false statement means Bob is not lying, but since Bob's statement is false, this doesn't create a contradiction.\n\nThus, since Alice, Bob, and Diana are all lying, and Charlie is telling the truth, the only suspect left who could have stolen the artifact is Alice.\n\nAnswer: Alice stole the artifact.",
