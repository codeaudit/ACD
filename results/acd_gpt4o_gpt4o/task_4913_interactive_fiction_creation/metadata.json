            "You are Detective Alex Harper, a seasoned investigator known for your sharp instincts and relentless determination. You've been called to the small, secluded town of Ravenswood to investigate the mysterious disappearance of local teacher, Emily Turner. As you arrive in town, you are greeted with wary glances from the townsfolk, who are clearly disturbed by recent events.\n\nDecision Point 1:\nYou decide to start your investigation. Where will you go first?\n1. Visit Emily Turner's home.\n2. Interview the townspeople at the local diner.\n3. Check out the school where Emily worked.\n\n---\n\n1. **Visit Emily Turner's home:**\nYou arrive at Emily's quaint, ivy-covered cottage. The door is unlocked, and as you step inside, you notice the place is eerily tidy, almost as if someone had cleaned up in a hurry.\n\n- **Search the living room:** You find a hidden compartment in the coffee table containing a diary with cryptic entries about a 'secret' and 'meeting someone at the old mill.'\n\n- **Search the bedroom:** You discover a locked drawer. After picking the lock, you find a letter addressed to Emily, warning her to \"stay away from the forest.\"\n\n- **Search the kitchen:** You find a torn piece of paper with an address scribbled on it \u2013 \"112 Oak Street.\"\n\n2. **Interview the townspeople at the local diner:**\nThe diner is buzzing with conversation, but it hushes as you walk in. You approach the counter where the friendly waitress, Sally, seems willing to talk.\n\n- **Talk to Sally:** Sally mentions seeing Emily with a stranger at the old mill a few days before she disappeared.\n\n- **Talk to the regulars:** An elderly man, Mr. Thompson, tells you about strange lights and noises coming from the forest at night.\n\n- **Talk to the cook:** The cook, Jim, recalls Emily confiding in him about feeling watched and finding strange symbols carved into her front door.\n\n3. **Check out the school where Emily worked:**\nThe school is quiet, with classes currently in session. You speak with Emily's closest colleague, Ms. Parker, who looks visibly shaken.\n\n- **Talk to Ms. Parker:** She reveals that Emily had been receiving threatening notes for weeks but was too scared to go to the authorities.\n\n- **Investigate Emily's classroom:** You find a hidden stash of papers in Emily\u2019s desk, including a map of the forest with an 'X' marking a spot near the old mill.\n\n- **Speak with the principal:** The principal, Mr. Greene, reluctantly admits that Emily was involved in a secretive research project about the town's haunted history.\n\n---\n\nDecision Point 2:\nBased on your findings, where will your investigation lead you next?\n1. Head to the old mill.\n2. Follow the address on the torn piece of paper.\n3. Investigate the forest.\n\n---\n\n1. **Head to the old mill:**\nThe old mill is abandoned and creepy. As you explore, you find signs of a recent struggle and a piece of Emily\u2019s scarf caught on a nail.\n\n- **Search the mill thoroughly:** You find a hidden basement with strange symbols on the walls and a journal detailing secret meetings about protecting the town from an ancient curse.\n\n- **Stake out the mill:** You wait in the shadows and catch a shadowy figure sneaking around. After a brief chase, you apprehend the town\u2019s reclusive historian, who confesses to knowing more about Emily\u2019s disappearance.\n\n- **Follow the trail outside the mill:** The trail leads to a hidden pathway into the forest, where you find more clues pointing towards a secret society.\n\n2. **Follow the address on the torn piece of paper:**\nYou arrive at 112 Oak Street, a run-down house on the outskirts of town. The door is ajar.\n\n- **Enter the house cautiously:** Inside, you find documents linking the house\u2019s owner to a series of disappearances over the years and a map with the forest circled.\n\n- **Question the neighbors:** They tell you the house belongs to a man named Carl, who has been acting suspiciously since Emily vanished.\n\n- **Search the surroundings:** You find a hidden tunnel leading directly into the forest, suggesting a covert route for illegal activities.\n\n3. **Investigate the forest:**\nThe forest is dense and foreboding. You find a trail of broken branches and disturbed earth leading deeper into the woods.\n\n- **Follow the trail:** The trail leads to a hidden clearing with a makeshift campsite and evidence that Emily was held there.\n\n- **Search for clues:** You find more symbols carved into trees and a hidden cache of supplies, including Emily\u2019s ID and personal items.\n\n- **Set a trap:** You set up a surveillance operation and catch a group of townspeople meeting in the forest, discussing their plans to protect the town from a supposed 'evil' Emily discovered.\n\n---\n\nDecision Point 3:\nWith the evidence gathered, what will you do next?\n1.

            "You are Aelric, a young wizard who has just completed his training at the esteemed Arcane Academy. Tales of a legendary artifact known as the \"Heart of the Elements\" have intrigued you since childhood. This artifact is said to bestow its bearer with unparalleled mastery over the four elements: earth, water, fire, and air. Determined to prove your worth and secure your place in history, you embark on a quest to find this mythical object.\n\n### Chapter 1: The Journey Begins\n\nAs you set out from the familiar grounds of the Academy, you come to a crossroads. The path to the left leads through a dense, mystical forest known for its enchanting creatures and hidden dangers. The path to the right takes you through an ancient, crumbling city rumored to be haunted by spirits of the past.\n\n#### Decision Point 1:\n- **Take the path through the mystical forest.**\n- **Take the path through the ancient city.**\n\n### If you choose to take the path through the mystical forest:\n\nYou step into the forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and the sound of rustling leaves. As you navigate through the dense foliage, you encounter a group of fairies who seem to be in distress.\n\n- **Offer to help the fairies.**\n- **Ignore the fairies and continue on your path.**\n\n### If you offer to help the fairies:\n\nThe fairies explain that their queen has been captured by a dark sorcerer who resides in a nearby cave. They promise to guide you to the Heart of the Elements if you rescue their queen.\n\n- **Agree to rescue the fairy queen.**\n- **Refuse and continue your quest alone.**\n\n### If you agree to rescue the fairy queen:\n\nYou enter the cave, using your magic to navigate its labyrinthine passages. After a fierce battle with the dark sorcerer, you free the fairy queen. Grateful, she grants you a magical map that reveals the location of the Heart of the Elements.\n\n### If you refuse and continue your quest alone:\n\nYou eventually find a hidden grove where the Heart of the Elements is said to be located, but without the fairies' guidance, you fall into a trap set by the dark sorcerer, ending your quest prematurely.\n\n### If you ignore the fairies and continue on your path:\n\nYou wander aimlessly through the forest until you reach a clearing where a wise old druid offers to share his knowledge of the Heart of the Elements in exchange for a rare herb found deep within the forest.\n\n- **Accept the druid's request.**\n- **Decline and rely on your own skills.**\n\n### If you choose to take the path through the ancient city:\n\nThe ancient city's ruins are eerie, with shadows flitting across the broken walls. As you explore, you come across an old library filled with ancient tomes and scrolls.\n\n- **Investigate the library for clues.**\n- **Avoid the library and explore the city further.**\n\n### If you investigate the library for clues:\n\nYou find a dusty old book that details the history of the Heart of the Elements and hints at its location. However, the moment you take the book, a spirit guardian appears, demanding a test of your magical prowess.\n\n- **Accept the spirit guardian's challenge.**\n- **Attempt to escape with the book.**\n\n### If you accept the spirit guardian's challenge:\n\nYou engage in a magical duel with the spirit guardian. After a taxing battle, you emerge victorious, and the spirit reveals the exact location of the Heart of the Elements.\n\n### If you attempt to escape with the book:\n\nThe spirit curses you, causing your magical abilities to weaken. Despite this, you continue your quest but find yourself ill-prepared to face the challenges ahead, leading to your eventual downfall.\n\n### If you avoid the library and explore the city further:\n\nYou stumble upon a secret underground passage that leads to an ancient temple. Inside, you find inscriptions that point you towards the Heart of the Elements, but the passage is guarded by a stone golem.\n\n- **Fight the stone golem.**\n- **Find another way around the golem.**\n\n### Chapter 2: The Final Trial\n\nRegardless of the decisions you made, you eventually find yourself at the entrance of a hidden sanctuary where the Heart of the Elements is kept. However, a final trial awaits you: a riddle set by the guardians of the artifact.\n\n\"To gain the Heart, you must answer true:\nWhat binds the elements in harmony, too?\"\n\nYou ponder the riddle, knowing that your answer will determine your fate.\n\n- **Answer: \"Balance.\"**\n- **Answer: \"Power.\"**\n\n### If you answer \"Balance\":\n\nThe guardians nod in approval, and the Heart of the Elements is revealed to you. You take the artifact, feeling its immense power coursing through you. Your quest is a success, and you return to the Arcane Academy as a celebrated hero.\n\n### If you answer \"Power\":\n\nThe guardians shake their heads, and the sanctuary begins to crumble around you. You manage to escape, but the Heart of the Elements remains out of reach, your quest ending in failure.\n\n### Epilogue:\n\nIn the end, your journey is shaped by the choices you made. Whether you return triumphant or empty-handed, the lessons learned and the experiences gained will forever shape your destiny as a wizard."

This artifact is said to bestow its bearer with unparalleled mastery over the four elements: earth, water, fire, and air. Determined to prove your worth and secure your place in history, you embark on a quest to find this mythical object.\n\n### Chapter 1: The Journey Begins\n\nAs you set out from the familiar grounds of the Academy, you come to a crossroads. The path to the left leads through a dense, mystical forest known for its enchanting creatures and hidden dangers. The path to the right takes you through an ancient, crumbling city rumored to be haunted by spirits of the past.\n\n#### Decision Point 1:\n- **Take the path through the mystical forest.**\n- **Take the path through the ancient city.**\n\n### If you choose to take the path through the mystical forest:\n\nYou step into the forest, the air thick with the scent of pine and the sound of rustling leaves. As you navigate through the dense foliage, you encounter a group of fairies who seem to be in distress.\n\n- **Offer to help the fairies.**\n- **Ignore the fairies and continue on your path.**\n\n### If you offer to help the fairies:\n\nThe fairies explain that their queen has been captured by a dark sorcerer who resides in a nearby cave. They promise to guide you to the Heart of the Elements if you rescue their queen.\n\n- **Agree to rescue the fairy queen.**\n- **Refuse and continue your quest alone.**\n\n### If you agree to rescue the fairy queen:\n\nYou enter the cave, using your magic to navigate its labyrinthine passages. After a fierce battle with the dark sorcerer, you free the fairy queen. Grateful, she grants you a magical map that reveals the location of the Heart of the Elements.\n\n### If you refuse and continue your quest alone:\n\nYou eventually find a hidden grove where the Heart of the Elements is said to be located, but without the fairies' guidance, you fall into a trap set by the dark sorcerer, ending your quest prematurely.\n\n### If you ignore the fairies and continue on your path:\n\nYou wander aimlessly through the forest until you reach a clearing where a wise old druid offers to share his knowledge of the Heart of the Elements in exchange for a rare herb found deep within the forest.\n\n- **Accept the druid's request.**\n- **Decline and rely on your own skills.**\n\n### If you choose to take the path through the ancient city:\n\nThe ancient city's ruins are eerie, with shadows flitting across the broken walls.

After a taxing battle, you emerge victorious, and the spirit reveals the exact location of the Heart of the Elements.\n\n### If you attempt to escape with the book:\n\nThe spirit curses you, causing your magical abilities to weaken. Despite this, you continue your quest but find yourself ill-prepared to face the challenges ahead, leading to your eventual downfall.\n\n### If you avoid the library and explore the city further:\n\nYou stumble upon a secret underground passage that leads to an ancient temple. Inside, you find inscriptions that point you towards the Heart of the Elements, but the passage is guarded by a stone golem.\n\n- **Fight the stone golem.**\n- **Find another way around the golem.**\n\n### Chapter 2: The Final Trial\n\nRegardless of the decisions you made, you eventually find yourself at the entrance of a hidden sanctuary where the Heart of the Elements is kept. However, a final trial awaits you: a riddle set by the guardians of the artifact.\n\n\"To gain the Heart, you must answer true:\nWhat binds the elements in harmony, too?\"\n\nYou ponder the riddle, knowing that your answer will determine your fate.\n\n- **Answer: \"Balance.\"**\n- **Answer: \"Power.\"**\n\n### If you answer \"Balance\":\n\nThe guardians nod in approval, and the Heart of the Elements is revealed to you.

Whether you return triumphant or empty-handed, the lessons learned and the experiences gained will forever shape your destiny as a wizard."

They don't dynamically track choices made in one part of a story and apply them consistently later on unless explicitly designed to do so.\n\n4. **Evaluation by an LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` method introduces another layer of complexity. Judging criteria such as engagement, coherence, and logical consistency are subjective and can vary. While LLMs can evaluate text, their judgments may not perfectly align with human expectations, especially for nuanced creative tasks.\n\nGiven these points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is somewhat surprising. Maintaining narrative coherence and logical consistency across multiple branches in an interactive fiction setting is complex and typically considered a challenging task even for advanced LLMs.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
