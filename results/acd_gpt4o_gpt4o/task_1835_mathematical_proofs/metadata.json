            "Proof: Given a triangle ABC, draw a line parallel to the base BC through the vertex A. This creates two alternate interior angles with the angles at B and C, which sum to the angle at A. Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.\n\nAnalysis: The provided proof is concise but lacks some detail. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Consider triangle ABC.\n2. Draw a line parallel to side BC through vertex A. Let's call this line DE.\n3. By the properties of parallel lines, angle DAB (an angle formed by DE and AB) is equal to angle ABC (since they are alternate interior angles).\n4. Similarly, angle EAC (an angle formed by DE and AC) is equal to angle ACB (since they are also alternate interior angles).\n5. Now, consider the straight line DE. The angles DAB, BAC, and EAC form a straight line and thus sum up to 180 degrees.\n6. Since angle DAB = angle ABC and angle EAC = angle ACB, we can substitute these into our equation: angle ABC + angle BAC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.\n7. Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.\n\nThe proof uses the properties of parallel lines and alternate interior angles to show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. It logically follows from the construction and application of these properties. The proof is coherent and adheres to standard mathematical conventions, demonstrating the truth of the given statement effectively.",
            "Proof: Consider a triangle ABC. We need to show that the sum of the interior angles of triangle ABC is 180 degrees. \n\n1. Draw a line parallel to the base BC through the vertex A. Let this line be DE, where D is on the extension of line segment AB and E is on the extension of line segment AC.\n\n2. Since DE is parallel to BC, and AB and AC are transversals, we can use the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem:\n   - The angle \u2220DAB is congruent to angle \u2220ABC (alternate interior angles).\n   - The angle \u2220EAC is congruent to angle \u2220ACB (alternate interior angles).\n\n3. The angles along line DE at point A form a straight line, which measures 180 degrees. Therefore,\n   \u2220DAB + \u2220BAC + \u2220EAC = 180 degrees.\n\n4. Substituting the congruent angles, we get:\n   \u2220ABC + \u2220BAC + \u2220ACB = 180 degrees.\n\nThus, the sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees, as required.\n\nAnalysis: The provided proof is logically sound and uses standard mathematical conventions. Here are the key steps and principles used:\n\n1. **Drawing a parallel line**: By drawing a line parallel to the base of the triangle through the opposite vertex, the proof sets up the use of alternate interior angles.\n2. **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem**: This theorem states that when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the pairs of alternate interior angles are congruent. This is a crucial step to relate the angles of the triangle to those on the straight line.\n3. **Straight Angle**: The proof leverages the fact that the angles on the straight line DE sum to 180 degrees.\n4. **Substitution of Congruent Angles**: By substituting the congruent alternate interior angles back into the equation, the proof demonstrates that the sum of the interior angles of the triangle is 180 degrees.\n\nOverall, the proof is coherent and follows a clear logical progression from the construction of the parallel line to the conclusion that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.",
            "Proof: Consider a triangle ABC. To prove that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Draw a line parallel to the base BC through the vertex A. Let's call this line DE.\n2. Since DE is parallel to BC and AB is a transversal, the alternate interior angle theorem tells us that angle DAB is equal to angle ABC.\n3. Similarly, since DE is parallel to BC and AC is a transversal, the alternate interior angle theorem tells us that angle EAC is equal to angle ACB.\n4.

Therefore, our initial assumption that \u221a2 is rational must be false. Hence, \u221a2 is irrational.\n\nAnalysis: The provided proof is a classic proof by contradiction, which is a common technique in mathematics to demonstrate the irrationality of certain numbers. The proof starts by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove, that \u221a2 is rational. From this assumption, the proof expresses \u221a2 as a fraction a/b in its simplest form and derives equations based on this assumption. \n\nThe proof uses basic algebraic manipulation and the properties of even and odd numbers. Specifically, it shows that if a^2 is even, then a must be even, and subsequently, if b^2 is even, then b must be even. This leads to a contradiction because if both a and b are even, the fraction a/b is not in its simplest form, which contradicts the initial assumption. \n\nThe logical steps are clear and follow a coherent structure, demonstrating the irrationality of \u221a2 by contradiction. The proof effectively uses fundamental mathematical principles such as properties of even and odd numbers and the concept of simplest form of fractions. Overall, the proof is logically sound and well-articulated.",
            "Answer: \n\nProof: Assume that \u221a2 is rational, meaning it can be written as a fraction a/b in its simplest form, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1. \n\n1. If \u221a2 is rational, then:\n   \u221a2 = a/b\n\n2. Squaring both sides:\n   2 = a^2/b^2\n\n3. Multiplying both sides by b^2:\n   a^2 = 2b^2\n\n4. This implies that a^2 is even (since it is equal to 2 times a whole number).\n\n5. If a^2 is even, then a must also be even (because the square of an odd number is odd).\n\n6. Let a = 2k, where k is an integer.\n\n7. Substituting 2k for a in the equation a^2 = 2b^2:\n   (2k)^2 = 2b^2\n   4k^2 = 2b^2\n\n8. Dividing both sides by 2:\n   2k^2 = b^2\n\n9. This implies that b^2 is even, and hence b must also be even.\n\n10. Since both a and b are even, they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts the assumption that a/b is in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that \u221a2 is rational is incorrect. Hence, \u221a2 is irrational.\n\nAnalysis: The provided proof is a classic proof by contradiction. The logical steps are as follows:\n\n1. Assume the opposite of what we want to prove (that \u221a2 is rational).\n2. Express \u221a2 as a fraction in its simplest form a/b.\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root.\n4. Manipulate the equation to show that a must be even.\n5. Represent a as 2k (since a is even).\n6. Substitute back into the equation to show that b must also be even.\n7. Conclude that both a and b being even contradicts the assumption that a/b is in simplest form.\n\nThe proof uses principles of number theory, specifically the properties of even and odd numbers and the concept of simplest form of a fraction. The steps are logically sound, and the proof correctly reaches a contradiction, thereby proving the original statement.",
            "Answer: \n\nProof: Assume that \u221a2 is rational, meaning it can be written as a fraction a/b in its simplest form, where a and b are integers with no common factors other than 1, and b \u2260 0.

The proof uses a method of contradiction, which is a common technique in mathematics. Here are the key logical steps and principles used:\n\n1. **Assumption of Rationality**: The proof begins by assuming that \u221a2 is rational and can be expressed as a fraction a/b in its simplest form.\n2. **Squaring Both Sides**: By squaring both sides of the equation \u221a2 = a/b, the proof shows that 2 = a^2/b^2.\n3. **Multiplication to Clear the Denominator**: Multiplying both sides by b^2 leads to the equation 2b^2 = a^2.\n4. **Implication of Evenness**: The proof deduces that a^2 is even, which implies that a must be even. The evenness of a leads to the substitution a = 2k.\n5. **Recursive Evenness**: Substituting a = 2k into the equation results in b^2 = 2k^2, showing that b^2 is even, and thus b must be even.\n6. **Contradiction**: Both a and b being even contradicts the initial assumption that a/b is in its simplest form, leading to the conclusion that \u221a2 cannot be rational.\n\nOverall, the proof is coherent, clearly articulated, and effectively demonstrates that \u221a2 is irrational by contradiction.",
