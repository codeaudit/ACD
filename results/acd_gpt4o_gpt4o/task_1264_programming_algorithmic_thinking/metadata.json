            "To solve the problem of finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target, we can use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to keep track of the numbers we have seen and their corresponding indices. This approach allows us to check in constant time if the complement of the current number exists in the hash map, resulting in an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Create an empty dictionary to store the numbers we have encountered and their indices.\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number in the array, calculate its complement by subtracting the number from the target.\n3. **Check the complement**: If the complement is already in the dictionary, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. Return their indices.\n4. **Store the number**: If the complement is not in the dictionary, store the current number and its index in the dictionary.\n\n### Complete Python Code\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    num_to_index = {}\n    \n    for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_to_index:\n            return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n        num_to_index[num] = index\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nprint(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   ```python\n   num_to_index = {}\n   ```\n   We create an empty dictionary `num_to_index` to store the numbers as keys and their indices as values.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**:\n   ```python\n   for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n   ```\n   We use `enumerate` to get both the index and the number as we iterate through the array.\n\n3. **Calculate the complement**:\n   ```python\n   complement = target - num\n   ```\n   For each number, we calculate its complement, which is the number that, when added to the current number, equals the target.\n\n4. **Check if the complement is in the dictionary**:\n   ```python\n   if complement in num_to_index:\n       return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n   ```\n   If the complement is already in the dictionary, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We return their indices.\n\n5. **Store the number and its index**:\n   ```python\n   num_to_index[num] = index\n   ```\n   If the complement is not found, we store the current number and its index in the dictionary for future reference.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Each input has exactly one solution, meaning there is always a pair of numbers that add up to the target.\n- The same element cannot be used twice, ensuring we don\u2019t use the same index for both numbers.\n\nBy following this approach, we efficiently find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the specified target. The use of a dictionary ensures that we can check for the complement in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).",
            "```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the indices of the elements\n    num_to_index = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the list of numbers\n    for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n        # Calculate the complement that would add up to the target\n        complement = target - num\n        \n        # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary\n        if complement in num_to_index:\n            # If found, return the indices of the complement and the current number\n            return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n        \n        # Otherwise, store the index of the current number in the dictionary\n        num_to_index[num] = index\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nprint(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an empty dictionary `num_to_index`. This dictionary will map each number in the list to its index.\n\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each element in the list `nums` using the `enumerate` function, which provides both the index and the value of each element.\n\n3. **Complement Calculation**: For each element `num` at index `index`, we calculate its complement as `target - num`. The complement is the value that, when added to `num`, equals the target.\n\n4. **Dictionary Lookup**: We check if the complement is already in the dictionary `num_to_index`. If it is, this means we have found two numbers that add up to the target, and their indices are the current index and the index of the complement (retrieved from the dictionary).\n\n5. **Return Result**: If the complement is found in the dictionary, we return a list containing the indices of the current number and its complement.\n\n6. **Update Dictionary**: If the complement is not found in the dictionary, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- Each input will have exactly one solution.\n- We cannot use the same element twice.\n- The input array and target are always valid and do not need additional validation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the solution in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

            "To solve the problem of finding two indices in an array that add up to a given target sum, we can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the numbers we have seen so far and their respective indices. This allows us to look up the complement of the current number efficiently.\n\nHere is the complete Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the numbers we have seen and their indices\n    seen = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the array\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        # Calculate the complement that would add up to the target with the current number\n        complement = target - num\n        \n        # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary\n        if complement in seen:\n            # If it is, return the indices of the complement and the current number\n            return [seen[complement], i]\n        \n        # Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary\n        seen[num] = i\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nresult = two_sum(nums, target)\nprint(result)  # Output should be [0, 1]\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty dictionary called `seen` to store numbers and their corresponding indices as we iterate through the array.\n\n2. **Iteration**: We use a `for` loop to iterate through each number in the array. The `enumerate` function gives us both the index `i` and the value `num` of each element in the array.\n\n3. **Complement Calculation**: For each number, we calculate its complement by subtracting the number from the target sum (`complement = target - num`).\n\n4. **Check for Complement**: We check if this complement already exists in the `seen` dictionary.\n   - If it does, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We retrieve the index of the complement from the `seen` dictionary and return a list containing this index and the current index `i`.\n   - If it does not, we add the current number and its index to the `seen` dictionary for future reference.\n\n5. **Return Result**: The function will return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. Since the problem guarantees exactly one solution, we don't need to handle cases where no solution is found.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. Each input array will have exactly one solution.\n2. The same element cannot be used twice to form the target sum.\n3. The input array and target are valid and contain appropriate values.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array, since we are iterating through the array only once and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are on average O(1).",

If there are no strings, the common prefix is an empty string.\n\n2. **Initialize the Prefix**:\n   ```python\n   prefix = strs[0]\n   ```\n   We start by assuming the first string in the list is the longest common prefix. This is a logical starting point because if there is a common prefix, it must be a prefix of this initial string.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Strings**:\n   ```python\n   for string in strs[1:]:\n   ```\n   We iterate over the remaining strings in the list.\n\n4. **Compare and Shorten Prefix**:\n   ```python\n   while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix:\n       prefix = prefix[:-1]\n       if not prefix:\n           return \"\"\n   ```\n   For each string, we compare the current prefix with the beginning of the string. If they don't match, we shorten the prefix by one character from the end (using `prefix[:-1]`) and check again. This loop continues until the prefix matches the beginning of the current string or becomes empty. If the prefix becomes empty, it means there is no common prefix among the strings, so we return an empty string.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   ```python\n   return prefix\n   ```\n   After processing all strings, the remaining prefix is the longest common prefix.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The input list of strings can be empty.\n- All strings are composed of lowercase English letters.\n- The function should work efficiently even if the list contains strings of varying lengths.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately find the longest common prefix by continuously refining our candidate prefix based on the strings in the list.

If it is, there is no common prefix to find, so the function immediately returns an empty string.\n\n2. **Initialize the Prefix**:\n    - Assume the first string `strs[0]` is the longest common prefix initially. This assumption is a starting point for comparison.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Strings**:\n    - The function then iterates over the remaining strings in the list (i.e., starting from `strs[1]` to the end of the list).\n\n4. **Compare and Update the Prefix**:\n    - For each string, it checks if the current prefix is a prefix of the string by comparing substrings (using slicing `string[:len(prefix)]`).\n    - If the current prefix is not a prefix of the string, the prefix is shortened by one character from the end (`prefix = prefix[:-1]`). This process is repeated until either the prefix matches the start of the string or the prefix becomes empty.\n    - If at any point the prefix becomes empty, it means there is no common prefix among all strings, and the loop can break early.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n    - After iterating through all strings, the remaining value of `prefix` is the longest common prefix, which is returned.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The input list `strs` contains at least one string.

This allows us to look up the complement of the current number efficiently.\n\nHere is the complete Python code that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the numbers we have seen and their indices\n    seen = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over the array\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        # Calculate the complement that would add up to the target with the current number\n        complement = target - num\n        \n        # Check if the complement is already in the dictionary\n        if complement in seen:\n            # If it is, return the indices of the complement and the current number\n            return [seen[complement], i]\n        \n        # Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary\n        seen[num] = i\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nresult = two_sum(nums, target)\nprint(result)  # Output should be [0, 1]\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing an empty dictionary called `seen` to store numbers and their corresponding indices as we iterate through the array.\n\n2. **Iteration**: We use a `for` loop to iterate through each number in the array. The `enumerate` function gives us both the index `i` and the value `num` of each element in the array.\n\n3. **Complement Calculation**: For each number, we calculate its complement by subtracting the number from the target sum (`complement = target - num`).\n\n4. **Check for Complement**: We check if this complement already exists in the `seen` dictionary.\n   - If it does, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. We retrieve the index of the complement from the `seen` dictionary and return a list containing this index and the current index `i`.\n   - If it does not, we add the current number and its index to the `seen` dictionary for future reference.\n\n5. **Return Result**: The function will return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. Since the problem guarantees exactly one solution, we don't need to handle cases where no solution is found.\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. Each input array will have exactly one solution.\n2. The same element cannot be used twice to form the target sum.\n3. The input array and target are valid and contain appropriate values.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array, since we are iterating through the array only once and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are on average O(1).",
            "To solve the problem of finding two indices in an array such that the numbers at those indices add up to a specific target, we can use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to achieve an efficient solution. Here are the steps and the corresponding Python code to solve this problem:\n\n### Code:\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    num_to_index = {}  # Dictionary to store number and its index\n    for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_to_index:\n            return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n        num_to_index[num] = index\n    return []  # This line will never be reached because the problem guarantees exactly one solution.\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nprint(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize an empty dictionary called `num_to_index`. This dictionary will be used to store the numbers from the array as keys and their respective indices as values.\n\n2. **Iteration Over the Array**:\n   - We loop through the array using the `enumerate` function, which gives us both the index and the value of each element.\n   - For each element `num` at index `index`, we calculate its complement as `target - num`.\n\n3. **Checking for the Complement**:\n   - We check if the complement exists in the `num_to_index` dictionary.\n   - If it exists, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target, and we return their indices: `[num_to_index[complement], index]`.\n   - If it does not exist, we add the current number and its index to the `num_to_index` dictionary for future reference.\n\n4. **Guaranteed Solution**:\n   - The problem guarantees that there is exactly one solution, so we are assured that the function will return a result before the loop ends.\n\n### Assumptions Made:\n- Each input array has exactly one solution, as stated in the problem.\n- We are not allowed to use the same element twice, which is implicitly handled by only considering each element once during the loop and checking for its complement among previously seen elements.\n- The input array and the target are valid and the array contains at least two elements.\n\nBy using a hash map, we achieve an average time complexity of O(n) since each look-up and insertion operation in a dictionary is O(1) on average. This is much more efficient than a brute-force solution which would have a time complexity of O(n^2).",
            "To solve the problem of finding two indices in an array whose elements sum up to a given target, we can use a hash map (dictionary in Python). This approach allows us to efficiently check if the complement of the current element (i.e., target - current element) has already been seen.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize a dictionary**: We will use this to store the elements we have already seen, along with their indices.\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element, compute its complement with respect to the target.\n3. **Check the dictionary**: If the complement is already in the dictionary, we have found our solution. If not, add the current element and its index to the dictionary.\n4. **Return the result**: Once we find the pair, we return their indices.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only pass through the array once, giving us a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.\n\n### Complete Code:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    # Dictionary to store the number and its index\n    num_to_index = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the list\n    for index, num in enumerate(nums):\n        # Calculate the complement\n        complement = target - num\n        \n        # Check if the complement exists in the dictionary\n        if complement in num_to_index:\n            # If it exists, return the indices\n            return [num_to_index[complement], index]\n        \n        # Otherwise, add the number and its index to the dictionary\n        num_to_index[num] = index\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nresult = two_sum(nums, target)\nprint(result)  # Output: [0, 1]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Dictionary Initialization**: `num_to_index = {}` initializes an empty dictionary to store the number and its index.\n2. **Loop Through Array**:\n   - `for index, num in enumerate(nums):` iterates through the array with both index and value.\n   - `complement = target - num` calculates the complement of the current number with respect to the target.\n3. **Check for Complement in Dictionary**:\n   - `if complement in num_to_index:` checks if the complement is already in the dictionary.\n   - If the complement is found, `return [num_to_index[complement], index]` returns the indices of the complement and the current number.\n4. **Update Dictionary**: `num_to_index[num] = index` adds the current number and its index to the dictionary if the complement is not found.\n\n### Assumptions:\n\n- The input array contains exactly one solution.\n- The same element cannot be used twice.\n\nBy following this approach, we ensure that our solution is both efficient and correct. The use of a dictionary allows us to achieve constant time lookups, making the overall time complexity linear."

            "To solve the problem of finding the longest common prefix among an array of strings, we'll use the following approach:\n\n1. **Edge Cases Handling**: First, we'll handle edge cases such as an empty list of strings.\n2. **Initialize the Prefix**: We'll take the first string as the initial prefix.\n3. **Iterate Over the Strings**: For each subsequent string, we'll compare it character by character with the current prefix and shorten the prefix if characters don't match.\n4. **Return the Result**: Once all strings have been processed, the remaining prefix will be the longest common prefix.\n\nHere's the complete Python code for the solution:\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonPrefix(strs):\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Start by assuming the first string is the common prefix\n    prefix = strs[0]\n    \n    # Compare the prefix with each string in the array\n    for string in strs[1:]:\n        # Reduce the prefix length until it matches the start of the string\n        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix:\n            prefix = prefix[:-1]\n            if not prefix:\n                return \"\"\n    \n    return prefix\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**:\n   ```python\n   if not strs:\n       return \"\"\n   ```\n   This handles the edge case where the input list is empty. If there are no strings, the common prefix is an empty string.\n\n2. **Initialize the Prefix**:\n   ```python\n   prefix = strs[0]\n   ```\n   We start by assuming the first string in the list is the longest common prefix. This is a logical starting point because if there is a common prefix, it must be a prefix of this initial string.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Strings**:\n   ```python\n   for string in strs[1:]:\n   ```\n   We iterate over the remaining strings in the list.\n\n4. **Compare and Shorten Prefix**:\n   ```python\n   while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix:\n       prefix = prefix[:-1]\n       if not prefix:\n           return \"\"\n   ```\n   For each string, we compare the current prefix with the beginning of the string. If they don't match, we shorten the prefix by one character from the end (using `prefix[:-1]`) and check again. This loop continues until the prefix matches the beginning of the current string or becomes empty. If the prefix becomes empty, it means there is no common prefix among the strings, so we return an empty string.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   ```python\n   return prefix\n   ```\n   After processing all strings, the remaining prefix is the longest common prefix.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The input list of strings can be empty.\n- All strings are composed of lowercase English letters.\n- The function should work efficiently even if the list contains strings of varying lengths.\n\nThis approach ensures that we accurately find the longest common prefix by continuously refining our candidate prefix based on the strings in the list. It is efficient because it reduces the prefix length only as needed and stops early if it determines that no common prefix exists.",
            "To solve the problem of finding the longest common prefix amongst an array of strings, we can follow a systematic approach. Here is the complete solution in Python along with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonPrefix(strs):\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Start by assuming the whole first string is the common prefix\n    prefix = strs[0]\n    \n    # Compare this prefix with each string in the list\n    for string in strs[1:]:\n        # Update the prefix to the common prefix between the current prefix and the string\n        while string[:len(prefix)] != prefix and prefix:\n            prefix = prefix[:-1]\n        if not prefix:\n            break\n    \n    return prefix\n\n# Example usage\nstrs = ['flower', 'flow', 'flight']\nprint(longestCommonPrefix(strs))  # Output: 'fl'\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Check**: \n    - The function first checks if the input list `strs` is empty. If it is, there is no common prefix to find, so the function immediately returns an empty string.\n\n2. **Initialize the Prefix**:\n    - Assume the first string `strs[0]` is the longest common prefix initially. This assumption is a starting point for comparison.\n\n3. **Iterate Through the Strings**:\n    - The function then iterates over the remaining strings in the list (i.e., starting from `strs[1]` to the end of the list).\n\n4. **Compare and Update the Prefix**:\n    - For each string, it checks if the current prefix is a prefix of the string by comparing substrings (using slicing `string[:len(prefix)]`).\n    - If the current prefix is not a prefix of the string, the prefix is shortened by one character from the end (`prefix = prefix[:-1]`). This process is repeated until either the prefix matches the start of the string or the prefix becomes empty.\n    - If at any point the prefix becomes empty, it means there is no common prefix among all strings, and the loop can break early.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n    - After iterating through all strings, the remaining value of `prefix` is the longest common prefix, which is returned.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The input list `strs` contains at least one string. If the list is empty, the function returns an empty string.\n- All strings in the list consist of lowercase English letters (since the problem does not specify otherwise).\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(S) where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.

Thus, we start by identifying the shortest string.\n2. **Iterate Over the Characters**: Iterate over the characters of the shortest string and compare each character with the corresponding character in all other strings.\n3. **Check for Mismatches**: If a mismatch is found at any position, the common prefix ends there.\n4. **Return the Result**: If no mismatches are found during the iteration, the shortest string itself is the longest common prefix.\n\nHere is the complete Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonPrefix(strs):\n    if not strs:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Find the shortest string in the list\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n        for other_str in strs:\n            if other_str[i] != char:\n                return shortest_str[:i]\n    \n    return shortest_str\n\n# Example usage\nstrs = ['flower', 'flow', 'flight']\nprint(longestCommonPrefix(strs))  # Output: 'fl'\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**:\n   ```python\n   if not strs:\n       return \"\"\n   ```\n   - If the input list is empty, return an empty string since there are no strings to compare.\n\n2. **Find the Shortest String**:\n   ```python\n   shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)\n   ```\n   - Use the `min` function with the `key=len` argument to find the shortest string in the array. This string limits the length of the possible common prefix.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Characters of the Shortest String**:\n   ```python\n   for i, char in enumerate(shortest_str):\n       for other_str in strs:\n           if other_str[i] != char:\n               return shortest_str[:i]\n   ```\n   - Use `enumerate` to get both the index and character of each character in the shortest string.\n   - For each character, compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.\n   - If a mismatch is found, return the substring of the shortest string up to the current index `i`.\n\n4. **Return the Shortest String If No Mismatches**:\n   ```python\n   return shortest_str\n   ```\n   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it means the entire shortest string is a common prefix.\n\n### Assumptions\n- The input is a list of strings.\n- The strings are non-empty.\n- The function handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty string.\n\nBy following this approach, we ensure that we efficiently find the longest common prefix by limiting comparisons to the length of the shortest string and stopping early as soon as a mismatch is found.",
