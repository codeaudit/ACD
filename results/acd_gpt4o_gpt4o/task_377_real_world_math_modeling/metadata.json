Solution to the Model\n\nTo find the optimal production quantities, we can graph the feasible region defined by the constraints and locate the vertices.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n1. **Graph the constraints:**\n   - For \\( 2x + y = 300 \\):\n     - When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 300 \\)\n     - When \\( y = 0 \\), \\( x = 150 \\)\n   - For \\( x + 2y = 200 \\):\n     - When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = 100 \\)\n     - When \\( y = 0 \\), \\( x = 200 \\)\n\n2. **Identify the feasible region:** The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap, including the non-negativity constraints.\n\n3. **Find the vertices of the feasible region:**\n   - Intersection of \\( 2x + y = 300 \\) and \\( x + 2y = 200 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\begin{cases}\n     2x + y = 300 \\\\\n     x + 2y = 200\n     \\end{cases}\n     \\]\n     Solving these simultaneously:\n     \\[\n     y = 300 - 2x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x + 2(300 - 2x) = 200\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x + 600 - 4x = 200\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -3x + 600 = 200\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -3x = -400\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{400}{3} \\approx 133.33\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y = 300 - 2(\\frac{400}{3}) = 300 - \\frac{800}{3} = \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.33\n     \\]\n\n   - Other vertices: (0,0), (0,100), (150,0).\n\n4. **Evaluate the objective function at each vertex:**\n   - At (0,0): \\( P = 40(0) + 30(0) = 0 \\)\n   - At (0,100): \\( P = 40(0) + 30(100) = 3000 \\)\n   - At (150,0): \\( P = 40(150) + 30(0) = 6000 \\)\n   - At \\( (\\frac{400}{3}, \\frac{100}{3}) \\approx (133.33, 33.33) \\):\n     \\[\n     P = 40 \\left(\\frac{400}{3}\\right) + 30 \\left(\\frac{100}{3}\\right) \\approx 40(133.33) + 30(33.33) = 5333.2\n     \\]\n\n### 3. Interpretation of the Results\n\n- The maximum profit occurs at the vertex (150,0), meaning the optimal solution is to produce 150 units of product A and 0 units of product B.\n- The maximum achievable profit is $6000.\n\n### Practical Implications and Recommendations\n\n- The company should focus entirely on producing product A to maximize its profit, given the current constraints on labor and materials.\n- It might be worth investigating if increasing the availability of labor or materials could allow for a more profitable mix that includes product B, especially if future market conditions or resource costs change.",
            "To address the task, we will formulate a linear programming model to maximize the company's profit given the constraints on labor and materials.

It may also explore the possibility of slight adjustments to these numbers to closely match the resource constraints while maximizing profit."

The average distance to a park location \\(L_i\\) is then the sum of these distances divided by the number of neighborhoods.\n\nLet's denote the average distance to a park location \\(L_i\\) as \\(D_{avg}(L_i)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Solution to the Model\n\nWe have three potential park locations: \\(L1(2,4)\\), \\(L2(5,6)\\), and \\(L3(4,3)\\), and four neighborhoods: \\(N1(1,3)\\), \\(N2(4,5)\\), \\(N3(3,7)\\), \\(N4(6,2)\\).\n\n#### Calculations\n\n1. **Distance from neighborhoods to L1(2,4):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   d_{N1-L1} &= \\sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (4-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2} \\\\\n   d_{N2-L1} &= \\sqrt{(2-4)^2 + (4-5)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n   d_{N3-L1} &= \\sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (4-7)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 9} = \\sqrt{10} \\\\\n   d_{N4-L1} &= \\sqrt{(2-6)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20}\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Average distance to L1:\n   \\[\n   D_{avg}(L1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{20}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Distance from neighborhoods to L2(5,6):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   d_{N1-L2} &= \\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (6-3)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\\\\n   d_{N2-L2} &= \\sqrt{(5-4)^2 + (6-5)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2} \\\\\n   d_{N3-L2} &= \\sqrt{(5-3)^2 + (6-7)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n   d_{N4-L2} &= \\sqrt{(5-6)^2 + (6-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17}\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Average distance to L2:\n   \\[\n   D_{avg}(L2) = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{5} + \\sqrt{17}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distance from neighborhoods to L3(4,3):**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   d_{N1-L3} &= \\sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (3-3)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 0} = 3 \\\\\n   d_{N2-L3} &= \\sqrt{(4-4)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 4} = 2 \\\\\n   d_{N3-L3} &= \\sqrt{(4-3)^2 + (3-7)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17} \\\\\n   d_{N4-L3} &= \\sqrt{(4-6)^2 + (3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1} = \\sqrt{5}\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n   Average distance to L3:\n   \\[\n   D_{avg}(L3) = \\frac{3 + 2 + \\sqrt{17} + \\sqrt{5}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Interpretation of the Results\n\nTo determine which location minimizes the average distance, we need to compare \\(D_{avg}(L1)\\), \\(D_{avg}(L2)\\), and \\(D_{avg}(L3)\\).\n\nCalculating the approximate values:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nD_{avg}(L1) &\\approx \\frac{1.41 + 2.24 + 3.16 + 4.47}{4} \\approx \\frac{11.28}{4} \\approx 2.82 \\\\\nD_{avg}(L2) &\\approx \\frac{5 + 1.41 + 2.24 + 4.12}{4} \\approx \\frac{12.77}{4} \\approx 3.19 \\\\\nD_{avg}(L3) &\\approx \\frac{3 + 2 + 4.12 + 2.24}{4} \\approx \\frac{11.36}{4} \\approx 2.84\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- \\(D_{avg}(L1) \\approx 2.82\\)\n- \\(D_{avg}(L2) \\approx 3.19\\)\n- \\(D_{avg}(L3) \\approx 2.84\\)\n\nThe location that minimizes the average distance for residents is **L1 (2,4)**.\n\nAnswer: The best location for the new park is L1 (2,4), as it minimizes the average distance for residents to travel to the park.",
