Below the roof, the house's facade features a central door, directly in the middle of the building, serving as the main entry point. The door is rectangular and proportionate to the size of the house.\n\nFlanking the door are two windows, one on each side. These windows are identical in size and shape, creating a sense of symmetry and harmony. The windows are rectangular and positioned at the same height, providing a uniform look.\n\nTo the left of the house stands a tree. The tree has a sturdy trunk and a full canopy, with leaves that spread out generously, adding a touch of nature to the scene. The tree is positioned close to the house but not touching it, creating a pleasant balance between the built environment and natural elements.\n\nIn the top right corner of the sky, the sun is shining brightly. The sun is depicted as a simple circle with rays extending outward, symbolizing a sunny day.

It has two doors, one on each side, with handles positioned in the middle of each door. On top of the car, there is a sunroof that is centered and rectangular in shape. Behind the car stands a tall and leafy tree, its branches spreading wide with a multitude of green leaves. The tree trunk is sturdy and brown, with the base slightly wider than the top. Above the tree, in the sky, a bird is depicted flying. The bird has outstretched wings and is in mid-flight, with its body angled slightly upward, suggesting movement and freedom.\n\n2. Drawing Instructions:\n1. Start by drawing the outline of a car. Begin with a long rectangle for the car's body.\n2. Add four circles at the bottom corners of the car for the wheels, ensuring they are evenly spaced.\n3. Inside the rectangle, draw two vertical rectangles on the sides for the doors. Place a small horizontal line on each door for the handles.\n4. On top of the car, draw a small rectangle in the center to represent the sunroof.\n5. Behind the car, draw a tall, vertical rectangle for the tree trunk. Make it slightly wider at the bottom.\n6. Add a large, irregular oval or cloud-like shape on top of the trunk to create the tree's foliage.\n7. Finally, in the sky above the tree, draw a bird. Sketch a small oval for the bird's body, and add two outstretched wings on either side. Make the wings slightly curved to suggest the bird is in flight."

They can often handle spatial reasoning and descriptive tasks reasonably well, especially with clear and structured input.\n\nThe use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring the task might introduce some variability, but it is generally acceptable for such text-based tasks where the criteria are clear and the expected outputs are well-defined.\n\nGiven the outlined task and considering that it involves well-structured text input and output, the success of the LLM agent on this task does not seem surprising. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance in similar descriptive and instructional tasks.\n\nDecision: No"
