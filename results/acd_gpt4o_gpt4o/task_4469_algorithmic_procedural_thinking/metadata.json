            "1. **Introduction to the Problem:**\n   The problem is how to prepare a simple and nutritious breakfast: scrambled eggs with toast. This is a quick and easy meal that can be made in under 10 minutes, providing a good balance of protein and carbohydrates to start the day.\n\n2. **Materials or Ingredients Needed:**\n   - 2 large eggs\n   - 2 slices of bread\n   - 1 tablespoon of butter (or margarine)\n   - Salt (to taste)\n   - Pepper (to taste)\n   - 1 tablespoon of milk (optional, for creamier eggs)\n   - Cooking spray or a small amount of oil\n   - A non-stick skillet\n   - A toaster\n   - A spatula\n   - A small bowl\n   - A fork or whisk\n\n3. **Detailed, Step-by-Step Procedure:**\n   1. **Preparation:**\n      - Gather all the ingredients and cooking tools listed above.\n      - Crack the two eggs into a small bowl.\n      - Add a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, and 1 tablespoon of milk (if desired) to the eggs.\n      - Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are fully combined.\n\n   2. **Toast Preparation:**\n      - Place the two slices of bread into the toaster.\n      - Set the toaster to your desired level of browning and start toasting.\n\n   3. **Cooking the Eggs:**\n      - Place the non-stick skillet on the stovetop and turn the heat to medium.\n      - Add a small amount of cooking spray or oil to the skillet to prevent the eggs from sticking.\n      - Once the skillet is hot (test by sprinkling a few drops of water - if they sizzle, it\u2019s ready), add the tablespoon of butter and let it melt, coating the bottom of the skillet.\n      - Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet.\n\n   4. **Scrambling the Eggs:**\n      - Allow the eggs to sit without stirring for about 30 seconds, until they start to set around the edges.\n      - Use the spatula to gently push the eggs from the edges of the skillet toward the center. Continue to cook, gently stirring and pushing the eggs around the skillet until they form soft curds.\n      - Cook until the eggs are just set but still slightly runny, as they will continue to cook a bit after being removed from the heat.\n      - Remove the skillet from the heat to stop the cooking process.\n\n   5. **Final Steps:**\n      - Check the toaster to see if the bread is toasted to your liking. If not, toast until done.\n      - Once the toast is ready, spread a small amount of butter or margarine on each slice if desired.\n      - Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate using the spatula.\n      - Place the toast on the same plate or a separate plate.\n\n4. **Final Check or Summary of the Process:**\n   - Ensure the scrambled eggs are cooked to your preferred consistency.\n   - Confirm the toast is browned to your liking and buttered if desired.\n   - Serve the scrambled eggs and toast immediately while they are still warm.\n   - Optionally, garnish the scrambled eggs with additional salt, pepper, or herbs if desired.\n\nBy following these steps, you will have prepared a delicious and nutritious breakfast of scrambled eggs with toast. Enjoy your meal!",
            "### Introduction:\nThe problem is how to prepare a simple and healthy breakfast: making a bowl of oatmeal with fresh fruit and nuts. This breakfast is nutritious, easy to prepare, and can be customized to suit individual preferences.\n\n### Materials/Ingredients Needed:\n1. Rolled oats (1 cup)\n2. Water or milk (2 cups)\n3. Fresh fruit (e.g., banana, berries, apple)\n4. Nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts)\n5. Honey or maple syrup (optional)\n6. Salt (a pinch)\n7. Cooking pot\n8. Spoon\n9. Bowl\n10. Knife and cutting board (if needed)\n11. Measuring cup\n\n### Procedure:\n1. **Gather Ingredients and Tools:**\n   - Collect all necessary ingredients and tools listed above. Ensure you have everything within reach before starting.\n\n2. **Measure Oats and Liquid:**\n   - Measure 1 cup of rolled oats and 2 cups of water or milk using the measuring cup.\n\n3. **Combine Oats and Liquid:**\n   - Pour the measured oats and liquid into a cooking pot.\n\n4. **Add a Pinch of Salt:**\n   - Add a pinch of salt to the pot to enhance the flavor of the oats.\n\n5. **Heat the Mixture:**\n   - Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. \n\n6. **Bring to a Boil:**\n   - Stir the mixture occasionally to prevent sticking. Allow the mixture to come to a boil.\n\n7. **Reduce Heat and Simmer:**\n   - Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let the oats simmer. Continue stirring occasionally.\n\n8. **Cook Until Desired Consistency:**\n   - Let the oats cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until they reach your desired consistency.
