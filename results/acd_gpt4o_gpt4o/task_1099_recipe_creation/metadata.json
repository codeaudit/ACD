            "Recipe:\nIngredients:\n- 2 chicken breasts\n- 1 lemon (zested and juiced)\n- 3 cloves of garlic (minced)\n- 3 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary (chopped)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. In a small bowl, combine the lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, chopped rosemary, salt, and pepper.\n3. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Let it marinate for about 10 minutes while the oven is preheating.\n4. Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a tablespoon of olive oil.\n5. Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off, and place the chicken breasts in the skillet. Sear each side for 2-3 minutes until golden brown.\n6. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C).\n7. Remove the skillet from the oven and let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\nExplanation:\nThe combination of lemon, garlic, and rosemary creates a flavorful and aromatic marinade that complements the chicken breast well. Lemon adds a bright, tangy flavor, while garlic provides depth and warmth. Rosemary, a classic herb for poultry, adds an earthy, pine-like aroma that pairs beautifully with the citrus and garlic.\n\nThe choice to sear the chicken breasts before baking helps develop a rich, golden-brown crust, enhancing both the texture and flavor of the dish. Using an oven-safe skillet allows for a seamless transition from stovetop to oven, minimizing the number of dishes used and keeping the cooking process efficient.\n\nThe overall prep time is kept under 30 minutes by using a quick marinade and a combined searing and baking method, ensuring the chicken is cooked through without being dry. This makes for a quick yet delicious main course that is both easy to prepare and satisfying.",

In a small bowl, mix the lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, chopped rosemary, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n2. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish and pour the lemon-garlic marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Marinate for 10 minutes.\n3. While the chicken is marinating, preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.\n4. Brush the grill or grill pan with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to prevent sticking.\n5. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it on the grill. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C) and the chicken is fully cooked.\n6. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.\n\nExplanation:\nThe recipe utilizes simple, fresh ingredients that complement each other well. Lemon and garlic are classic pairings with chicken, adding a bright and aromatic flavor. Rosemary provides an earthy note that balances the acidity of the lemon. Olive oil is used both in the marinade and for grilling to ensure the chicken stays moist and doesn't stick to the grill. The prep time is kept under 30 minutes by using quick-marinating chicken breasts and a fast cooking method like grilling, which also adds a nice charred flavor to the dish.",

Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. In a small bowl, mix together the lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, olive oil, and chopped rosemary.\n3. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.\n4. Place the chicken breasts in a baking dish and pour the lemon, garlic, olive oil, and rosemary mixture over them, making sure they are well coated.\n5. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center.\n6. Remove from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\nExplanation:\nThe choice of ingredients and cooking techniques are designed to create a flavorful and aromatic main course while adhering to the given constraints. Lemon and garlic are classic pairings with chicken, providing a bright and zesty flavor that complements the mildness of the chicken breast. Olive oil ensures the chicken remains moist and aids in the caramelization process during baking. Fresh rosemary adds a woody, fragrant note that enhances the overall flavor profile. The recipe is straightforward and efficient, ensuring the prep time stays under 30 minutes while delivering a delicious and satisfying main course.",

Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. In a small bowl, combine the lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, chopped rosemary, salt, and pepper to create a marinade.\n3. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Let it marinate for 10-15 minutes.\n4. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a little olive oil to coat the bottom.\n5. Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Sear the chicken breasts in the skillet for about 2-3 minutes on each side, until they develop a golden-brown crust.\n6. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n7. Remove the skillet from the oven and let the chicken rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nExplanation:\nThe choice of ingredients aims to create a flavorful, aromatic, and healthy main course that can be prepared quickly. Chicken breast is a lean protein that cooks relatively fast, making it ideal for a dish with a prep time under 30 minutes. Lemon adds a fresh, tangy flavor that pairs well with chicken and helps tenderize the meat. Garlic and rosemary are classic complementary flavors that enhance the dish's aroma and taste. Olive oil is used both in the marinade and for searing the chicken, adding a rich, smooth texture.\n\nMarinating the chicken briefly infuses it with flavor without requiring a long wait. Searing the chicken in a skillet before baking helps develop a delicious crust while finishing the cooking in the oven ensures the meat is evenly cooked and juicy. This method balances speed and flavor, ensuring the dish is ready within the given time constraint.",

Serve the tofu and broccoli stir-fry hot, optionally garnished with sesame seeds.\n\nExplanation:\nThe choice of ingredients and cooking techniques aims to create a balanced, flavorful, and nutritious vegan dish. Tofu serves as the protein base, while broccoli adds essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Sesame oil is used for its rich, nutty flavor which complements the soy sauce and ginger beautifully.\n\nTo ensure the tofu has a desirable texture, pressing it removes excess moisture, allowing it to crisp up nicely when pan-fried. Using both sesame oil and olive oil for frying provides a good balance of flavor and heat stability.\n\nGinger is saut\u00e9ed first to release its aromatic compounds, enhancing the overall flavor profile of the dish. The broccoli is then stir-fried to retain its bright color and slight crunch, contributing to both the visual appeal and texture of the meal.\n\nMixing soy sauce with water creates a simple, yet effective sauce that coats the tofu and broccoli evenly, ensuring every bite is flavorful without being overpoweringly salty.\n\nFinally, the optional sesame seeds add an extra layer of texture and a slight nutty taste, rounding out the dish. This recipe is designed to be straightforward yet delicious, making it an excellent vegan option for at least two people.",
            "Answer: \n\nRecipe:\nIngredients:\n- 1 block of firm tofu (about 14 ounces)\n- 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated\n- 2 cups broccoli florets\n- 2 tablespoons sesame oil\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil (optional, for crisping tofu)\n- 1/4 cup water\n- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Press the tofu to remove excess water by wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel and placing a heavy object on top. Let it sit for about 15 minutes.\n2. While the tofu is pressing, prepare the sauce by mixing the soy sauce and grated ginger in a small bowl.\n3. Cut the pressed tofu into 1-inch cubes.\n4. Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil (or olive oil for extra crispiness) in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes and cook until golden brown on all sides, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside.\n5. In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of sesame oil. Add the broccoli florets and stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes until they are bright green and slightly tender.\n6. Return the tofu to the skillet and pour the soy sauce and ginger mixture over the tofu and broccoli.\n7. Add 1/4 cup of water to the skillet, stir well, and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly and coats the tofu and broccoli evenly.\n8. Serve the tofu and broccoli stir-fry hot, garnished with sesame seeds if desired.\n\nExplanation:\nThis recipe leverages the complementary flavors of tofu, soy sauce, and ginger, which are commonly used together in many Asian dishes to create a savory and aromatic profile. Firm tofu is ideal because it holds its shape well during stir-frying. Pressing the tofu removes excess moisture, allowing it to crisp up better when cooked.\n\nBroccoli is chosen as it pairs well with the tofu and adds a nutritious, crunchy element to the dish. Stir-frying the broccoli ensures it retains its vibrant color and slight crunch, which contrasts nicely with the soft texture of the tofu.\n\nSesame oil is used for its distinctive, nutty flavor that enhances the overall taste of the dish. The optional olive oil can help to crisp the tofu further if desired, adding a delightful texture.\n\nThe soy sauce and ginger mixture acts as a simple yet flavorful sauce that brings all the elements together. Adding water helps to deglaze the pan and create a light coating sauce that binds the tofu and broccoli.\n\nThe sesame seeds are optional but add a pleasant visual appeal and a slight crunch to the finished dish. This recipe is straightforward, quick to prepare, and adheres to the vegan constraint while serving at least two people generously."
