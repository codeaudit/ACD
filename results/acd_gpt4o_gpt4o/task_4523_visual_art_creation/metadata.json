This will be the horizon where the sky meets the sea.\n2. **Sketch the Sun**: Draw a semi-circle just above the horizon line in the center or slightly to the left or right. This will be the setting sun. Make sure it's large enough to be noticeable but not too overwhelming.\n3. **Draw the Waves**: Below the horizon line, draw a series of wavy lines that get progressively smaller as they approach the shore at the bottom of your paper. These will be the waves. Make sure to keep the waves closer together as they get nearer to the horizon line to create a sense of distance.\n4. **Position the Palm Tree**: On the left or right side of your paper, draw the trunk of the palm tree. Start with two slightly curved lines that converge at the bottom. The trunk should be about one-third the height of your paper. Add textured lines along the trunk to give it a realistic look.\n5. **Add Palm Leaves**: At the top of the trunk, draw several long, curved lines extending outwards to form the leaves. Each leaf should have a series of smaller lines branching off from the main line to create the fronds. Ensure the leaves are spread out evenly around the top of the trunk.\n6. **Draw the Beach Umbrella**: Near the bottom of the paper, draw a small circle or oval for the top of the umbrella. From the circle, draw lines extending outward to form the umbrella's canopy, making sure it looks like a semi-circle. Add vertical lines from the edges to the center to give it a ribbed appearance.

The pole should be about half the height of the palm tree trunk.\n\n7. **Draw the Umbrella Canopy:**\n   - At the top of the pole, draw a semi-circle or dome shape. Add panels by drawing lines from the top of the pole to the edge of the canopy. Optionally, you can add a wavy edge to the canopy for more detail.\n\n8. **Create the Sandcastle Base:**\n   - Near the bottom center of the paper, draw a simple square or rectangular shape. This will be the base of the sandcastle. Make sure it is proportionate to the umbrella and palm tree.\n\n9. **Add Details to the Sandcastle:**\n   - Draw smaller rectangles or squares on top of the base to form towers. Add lines and small shapes to represent windows and doors. You can also draw tiny flags on top of the towers for extra detail.\n\n10. **Draw the Beach Sand:**\n    - Below the horizon line and around the base of the palm tree, umbrella, and sandcastle, draw a wavy line to represent the edge of the beach. Fill this area with small dots or short lines to texture the sand.\n\n11. **Add Shells and Beach Details:**\n    - Scatter small shell shapes, pebbles, and perhaps a starfish around the sand for added detail.\n\n12. **Finalize the Scene with Shadows and Highlights:**\n    - Add shadows to the palm tree, umbrella, sandcastle, and other objects to create depth. Highlight the waves with white or lighter lines to show the sun reflecting off the water.\n\n13. **Color Your Drawing:**\n    - If desired, color the sky with shades of orange, pink, and purple to represent the setting sun. Color the waves with shades of blue and white, the palm tree with brown and green, and the sand with light tan or yellow. The umbrella and sandcastle can be colored with bright, vivid colors to make them stand out.\n\nAnswer: \n1. Draw the Horizon Line.\n2. Draw the Setting Sun.\n3. Sketch the Waves.\n4.
