This requires spatial reasoning, visualization, and linguistic articulation.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, which suggests a high level of complexity in terms of spatial reasoning and clear articulation.\n\n3. **LLM Capabilities**: LLMs, especially advanced ones, have shown capabilities in understanding and generating text descriptions based on given instructions. However, spatial reasoning and the ability to visualize and articulate spatial relationships are not their strongest suits. This type of task may present a challenge for the model, as it requires not just linguistic understanding but also spatial comprehension.\n\n4. **Scoring Method**: The task is automatically scored using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which evaluates based on predefined criteria. While LLM judges can assess clarity and format adherence, their ability to evaluate the accuracy of spatial descriptions may not be perfect.\n\nConsidering that the task is described as difficult for humans and requires advanced spatial reasoning in addition to linguistic skills, it would generally be challenging for an LLM to succeed consistently at this task. The success of the LLM at this task suggests a noteworthy achievement as it indicates that the model can handle complex spatial reasoning and articulate it accurately.\n\nDecision: Yes"
