Initially, the activation energy is provided by a spark or flame, which breaks the molecular bonds in H2 and O2. This results in the formation of highly reactive hydrogen and oxygen radicals. These radicals then combine to form water molecules, releasing energy in the process. The overall reaction can be broken down into the following elementary steps:\n1. H2 -> 2H (dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atoms)\n2. O2 -> 2O (dissociation of oxygen molecules into atoms)\n3. H + O2 -> HO2 (formation of a hydroperoxyl radical)\n4. HO2 + H -> 2OH (formation of hydroxyl radicals)\n5. OH + H2 -> H2O + H (formation of water and hydrogen radicals)\n6. OH + H -> H2O (formation of water)",

It is highly exothermic, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of heat and light.\nMechanism: The reaction mechanism involves the breaking of the H-H and O=O bonds in the hydrogen and oxygen molecules, respectively, followed by the formation of O-H bonds to produce water. This reaction proceeds via a radical chain mechanism, where initial radicals generated by the spark or flame propagate the reaction, leading to the rapid formation of water molecules.",

Initiation: A spark or flame provides the activation energy needed to break the H-H and O=O bonds.\n2. Propagation: The resultant hydrogen and oxygen radicals react with each other to form water molecules.\n3.
