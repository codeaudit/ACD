The intersecting lines create an impression of depth and perspective, leading the brain to misinterpret the parallel lines as diverging or converging.",
            "Recognition:\n- Name: The Hering Illusion\n- Description: A set of parallel lines appears to be non-parallel due to the presence of radiating or converging lines in the background. The parallel lines seem to bow outward or inward depending on the direction of the background lines.\n- Perceptual Explanation: This illusion occurs because the visual system interprets the converging lines as a perspective cue, creating a false sense of depth. The brain perceives the parallel lines as part of a 3D scene rather than a flat 2D image, leading to a distortion in their perceived orientation.",

The slight misalignment of the bricks creates a visual distortion, making the parallel lines seem as if they are sloping or wavy. The high contrast and positioning trick the brain into misinterpreting the spatial relationships.",

The short diagonal lines create a context that suggests a false perspective, leading the brain to perceive the parallel lines as if they are diverging or converging. This misperception is due to the brain's attempt to interpret the overall scene in a three-dimensional space, causing the parallel lines to appear skewed.",
