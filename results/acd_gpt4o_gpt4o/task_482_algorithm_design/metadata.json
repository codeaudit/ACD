            "To find the longest palindromic substring efficiently, we can use an algorithm called \"Expand Around Center.\" This algorithm leverages the property of palindromes to check for palindromic substrings by expanding from the center outward. The key idea is that a palindrome mirrors around its center.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - `start` and `end` variables to keep track of the beginning and end indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n\n2. **Helper Function (expandAroundCenter)**:\n   - Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right)` that takes the string `s` and two indices `left` and `right`. This function will expand around these indices while the substring remains a palindrome.\n   - Inside this function, use a while loop to check if `s[left] == s[right]` and expand outwards by decrementing `left` and incrementing `right` until the characters are no longer equal or the indices go out of bounds.\n   - Return the length of the palindrome found by the expansion, which is `right - left - 1`.\n\n3. **Main Loop**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the string using an index `i`.\n   - For each character, consider it as the center of a palindrome. There are two cases:\n     - Odd-length palindromes, where the center is a single character (`left = i, right = i`).\n     - Even-length palindromes, where the center is between two characters (`left = i, right = i + 1`).\n   - For each case, call the `expandAroundCenter` function and calculate the length of the palindrome.\n   - Update the `start` and `end` indices if the current palindrome length is greater than the previous maximum length found.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After iterating through the string, use the `start` and `end` indices to return the longest palindromic substring.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. Although this might seem inefficient, it is much faster than the brute-force approach and is often acceptable for practical purposes.\n\nHere is the algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    def expandAroundCenter(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n\n    if not s or len(s) < 1:\n        return \"\"\n\n    start, end = 0, 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)         # Odd-length palindromes\n        len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)     # Even-length palindromes\n        max_len = max(len1, len2)\n        if max_len > end - start:\n            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n            end = i + max_len // 2\n\n    return s[start:end + 1]\n```\n\nIn summary, this algorithm efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring by expanding around potential centers and has a time complexity of O(n^2).",
            "To solve the problem of finding the longest palindromic substring efficiently, we can use an algorithm known as the \"Expand Around Center\" approach. This algorithm is both intuitive and efficient. Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including its steps, logic, and time complexity:\n\n### Algorithm Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define a function `longestPalindrome(s)` that takes a string `s` as input.\n   - Initialize two variables, `start` and `end`, to keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n\n2. **Helper Function:**\n   - Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right)` that takes the string `s` and two indices `left` and `right` as input.\n   - This function will expand around the center indices `left` and `right` to find the longest palindrome centered at these indices.\n   - While expanding, check if the characters at the current `left` and `right` indices are equal. If they are, continue expanding by decrementing `left` and incrementing `right`.\n   - Return the length of the palindrome found.\n\n3. **Main Logic:**\n   - Iterate through each character in the string `s` using a loop.\n   - For each character, consider two cases for the center of the palindrome:\n     - Single center (`i, i`): This is for odd-length palindromes.\n     - Double center (`i, i + 1`): This is for even-length palindromes.\n   - For each center, use the `expandAroundCenter` function to find the longest palindrome centered at those indices.\n   - Update the `start` and `end` indices if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - After iterating through all characters, return the substring of `s` from `start` to `end + 1` as the longest palindromic substring.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    start, end = 0, 0\n    \n    def expandAroundCenter(s, left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)\n        len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)\n        max_len = max(len1, len2)\n        \n        if max_len > end - start:\n            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n            end = i + max_len // 2\n    \n    return s[start:end + 1]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The time complexity of the \"Expand Around Center\" approach is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we potentially expand around each character and its adjacent pair, and each expansion can take up to `O(n)` time in the worst case.\n- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we only use a few extra variables and do not require additional space proportional to the input size.\n\nThus, the \"Expand Around Center\" approach provides an efficient and straightforward solution to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.",
            "To find the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently, we can use an algorithm known as \"Expand Around Center.\" This algorithm is both intuitive and has a reasonable time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.\n\n### Algorithm Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables, `start` and `end`, to keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n\n2. **Expand Around Center**: For each character in the string, consider it as the center of a potential palindrome. There are two cases to consider:\n   - **Odd-length palindromes**: A single character center.\n   - **Even-length palindromes**: A two-character center.\n   \n   For each center, expand outwards while the characters on both sides are the same (i.e., the substring remains a palindrome).\n\n3. **Update Longest Palindrome**: If the length of the palindrome found by expanding around the current center is greater than the length of the previously found longest palindrome, update the `start` and `end` indices.\n\n4. **Result**: After iterating through all possible centers, the longest palindromic substring can be obtained from the original string using the `start` and `end` indices.\n\n### Steps Involved:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   ```python\n   def longest_palindromic_substring(s):\n       if not s:\n           return \"\"\n       \n       start, end = 0, 0\n       \n       for i in range(len(s)):\n           len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)     # Odd-length palindromes\n           len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1) # Even-length palindromes\n           max_len = max(len1, len2)\n           \n           if max_len > (end - start):\n               start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n               end = i + max_len // 2\n       \n       return s[start:end + 1]\n   ```\n\n2. **Helper Function (Expand Around Center)**:\n   ```python\n   def expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n       while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n           left -= 1\n           right += 1\n       return right - left - 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Time Complexity**: The `expand_around_center` function runs in O(n) time for each center, and we have 2n - 1 possible centers (n single characters and n-1 pairs). Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).\n\n### Example:\n\nFor the string \"babad\":\n- Center at index 0: \"b\" (len1 = 1)\n- Center at index 1 and 2: \"bab\" and \"aba\" (len2 = 3)\n- Center at index 3: \"a\" (len1 = 1)\n- Center at index 4: \"d\" (len1 = 1)\n\nThe longest palindromic substring is \"bab\" or \"aba\".\n\nThis algorithm ensures that we efficiently find the longest palindromic substring with a clear and logical approach, leveraging the property of palindromes expanding symmetrically from their center.",

This function will expand around these two indices as long as the characters at `left` and `right` are equal and within the bounds of the string.\n   - Initialize two variables to keep track of the start and end indices of the longest palindromic substring found.\n\n2. **Expand Around Each Center**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the string, using each character (and the gap between each pair of characters) as a potential center for a palindrome.\n   - For each character at index `i`, expand around it considering it as the center of an odd-length palindrome.\n   - Also, expand around the gap between index `i` and `i+1` to consider even-length palindromes.\n\n3. **Update the Longest Palindrome**:\n   - For each center, use the `expand_around_center` function to find the longest palindrome centered at that point.\n   - Update the start and end indices if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Extract the substring from the start to the end indices and return it as the longest palindromic substring.\n\n### Pseudocode:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s):\n    def expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return left + 1, right - 1\n\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n\n    start, end = 0, 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd-length palindromes\n        left1, right1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)\n        # Even-length palindromes\n        left2, right2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)\n\n        if right1 - left1 > end - start:\n            start, end = left1, right1\n        if right2 - left2 > end - start:\n            start, end = left2, right2\n\n    return s[start:end + 1]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis:\n- The `expand_around_center` function runs in \\(O(n)\\) in the worst case, where \\(n\\) is the length of the string.\n- Since we call this function twice for each of the \\(n\\) characters, the overall time complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\).\n\n### Space Complexity Analysis:\n- The space complexity is \\(O(1)\\) since we are only using a few extra variables for indices and not using any additional data structures that scale with input size.\n\nThis algorithm is straightforward and leverages the property of palindromes being symmetric to efficiently find the longest palindromic substring.",
            "To find the longest palindromic substring in a given string efficiently, we can use the \"expand around center\" approach. This method is more optimal compared to the brute-force method, which has a time complexity of O(n^3). The \"expand around center\" approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is suitable for most practical purposes.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation and steps involved in this algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right)` that takes the string `s` and two indices `left` and `right`, and expands around these indices to find the longest palindromic substring centered at `left` and `right`.\n   - Initialize two variables `start` and `end` to keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindromic substring found.\n\n2. **Expanding Around Each Possible Center**:\n   - Iterate through the string with an index `i` from 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the string).\n     - For each index `i`, consider it as the center of a palindrome.\n     - Call the `expandAroundCenter` function twice: once with `left` and `right` both set to `i` (for odd-length palindromes), and once with `left` set to `i` and `right` set to `i+1` (for even-length palindromes).\n     - Compare the lengths of the palindromes obtained from both calls and update the `start` and `end` indices if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n3. **Helper Function**:\n   - The `expandAroundCenter` function will:\n     - Start with the given `left` and `right` indices.\n     - Expand outwards while the characters at `left` and `right` are equal, decrementing `left` and incrementing `right`.\n     - Return the length of the palindrome found by subtracting the final values of `left` and `right`.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - After iterating through the entire string, the longest palindromic substring can be obtained using the `start` and `end` indices.\n\n### Detailed Algorithm\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    def expandAroundCenter(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n    \n    start, end = 0, 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)       # Odd-length palindromes\n        len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)   # Even-length palindromes\n        max_len = max(len1, len2)\n        if max_len > end - start:\n            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n            end = i + max_len // 2\n    \n    return s[start:end + 1]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, we potentially expand around it to the entire length of the string, leading to a nested loop effect.\n\n### Space Complexity\nThe space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space for variables `start`, `end`, `left`, `right`, and some helper variables. The input string itself is not modified, ensuring minimal additional space usage.\n\nIn summary, this \"expand around center\" approach provides an efficient and clear solution to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string with a time complexity of O(n^2)."

            "To optimize the algorithm for sorting an array of integers to achieve a time complexity of O(n log n) or better, I will describe an optimized version of the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best). Here is a detailed explanation of the optimized Merge Sort algorithm and the techniques used:\n\n### Merge Sort Algorithm\n\n#### Overview\nMerge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting each sub-array, and then merging the sorted sub-arrays to produce the final sorted array.\n\n#### Steps Involved\n1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.\n3. **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves to produce the sorted array.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation\n\n1. **Divide**:\n   - If the array has more than one element, split it into two halves. This can be done by finding the middle index of the array.\n   - For an array `arr` of size `n`, the middle index is `mid = n // 2`.\n   \n2. **Conquer**:\n   - Recursively apply the Merge Sort algorithm to each half.\n   - This step ensures that the sub-arrays are broken down until they contain only one element (a single element array is trivially sorted).\n\n3. **Merge**:\n   - Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\n   - This involves comparing the elements of the sub-arrays and arranging them in order.\n   - Use two pointers to traverse the sub-arrays and build the merged array by selecting the smaller element from the current position of the pointers.\n\n#### Optimization Techniques\n\n1. **In-Place Merge**:\n   - Traditional Merge Sort uses O(n) extra space for merging sub-arrays. An in-place merge can reduce the space complexity.\n   - Use a technique called \"in-place merge\" to merge sorted sub-arrays without extra space.\n   - This technique involves shifting elements in the array to create space for merging, thereby reducing the need for additional arrays.\n\n2. **Iterative Merge Sort**:\n   - Instead of using recursive calls, which can lead to significant overhead due to function call stack usage, an iterative version can be implemented.\n   - Use a bottom-up approach where the array is sorted in small segments and then merged iteratively.\n\n3. **Hybrid Approach**:\n   - Combine Merge Sort with another sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort for small sub-arrays.\n   - Insertion Sort is efficient for small arrays due to low overhead. When the sub-array size is below a certain threshold (e.g., 32 elements), use Insertion Sort instead of Merge Sort.\n\n### Time Complexity\n- **Divide**: Each division operation takes O(1) time and there are log(n) levels of division.\n- **Conquer**: Each recursive call processes n elements, leading to O(n) work at each level.\n- **Merge**: Merging two sorted sub-arrays takes O(n) time.\n\nSince the array is split in half logarithmically and merging each level takes linear time, the overall time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n    \n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    merged = []\n    left_index, right_index = 0, 0\n    \n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n    \n    merged.extend(left[left_index:])\n    merged.extend(right[right_index:])\n    \n    return merged\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThe optimized Merge Sort algorithm described above achieves the desired time complexity of O(n log n) by using efficient division and merging techniques. The hybrid approach further optimizes performance by incorporating Insertion Sort for small sub-arrays, ensuring that the overall sorting process is as efficient as possible.",

We can set a threshold (e.g., 32 elements) below which Insertion Sort is used. This reduces the overhead of recursive function calls and takes advantage of the low overhead of Insertion Sort for small arrays.\n   - **Avoid Unnecessary Copies**: During the merge process, we can avoid unnecessary copying of elements by using an auxiliary array only once. We alternate the roles of the original array and the auxiliary array during merging.\n   - **Natural Merge Sort**: Detect already sorted subarrays (runs) and merge them directly. This can help when the input array has some existing order.\n\n3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - **Step 1: Divide**: Recursively divide the array into halves until subarrays of size less than or equal to the threshold (e.g., 32) are obtained.\n   - **Step 2: Sort Small Subarrays**: Use Insertion Sort to sort these small subarrays.\n   - **Step 3: Merge**: Merge the sorted subarrays back together, alternating between the original array and an auxiliary array to minimize copying.\n\n4. **Detailed Explanation**:\n   - **Threshold for Insertion Sort**: Choose a small value, such as 32. When the subarray size is less than or equal to this threshold, apply Insertion Sort.\n   - **Auxiliary Array**: Allocate an auxiliary array of the same size as the original array. During merging, alternate between using the original array and the auxiliary array to avoid excessive copying.\n   - **Merge Function**: Implement a merge function that combines two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. Ensure the merge function is efficient by minimizing the number of element comparisons and moves.\n   - **Natural Merge Sort**: Traverse the array to identify already sorted runs and merge these runs directly. This can significantly speed up sorting for partially sorted inputs.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```plaintext\nfunction hybridMergeSort(arr):\n    if length of arr <= 32:\n        insertionSort(arr)\n        return\n\n    auxiliary = copy of arr\n    sort(arr, auxiliary, 0, length of arr - 1)\n\nfunction sort(arr, aux, low, high):\n    if high <= low:\n        return\n    if high - low <= 32:\n        insertionSort(arr, low, high)\n        return\n\n    mid = low + (high - low) / 2\n    sort(aux, arr, low, mid)\n    sort(aux, arr, mid + 1, high)\n    merge(arr, aux, low, mid, high)\n\nfunction merge(arr, aux, low, mid, high):\n    i = low\n    j = mid + 1\n    for k = low to high:\n        if i > mid:\n            arr[k] = aux[j++]\n        else if j > high:\n            arr[k] = aux[i++]\n        else if aux[j] < aux[i]:\n            arr[k] = aux[j++]\n        else:\n            arr[k] = aux[i++]\n\nfunction insertionSort(arr, low, high):\n    for i = low + 1 to high:\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= low and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j = j - 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe overall time complexity of the optimized Merge Sort remains O(n log n) due to the divide-and-conquer approach. The use of Insertion Sort for small subarrays does not affect the worst-case time complexity but improves the constant factors, making the algorithm more efficient in practice.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy combining Merge Sort with Insertion Sort for small subarrays and optimizing the merge process with an auxiliary array and natural merge sort techniques, we achieve an efficient and practical sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n).

This reduces the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation, which can be significant for large arrays.\n\n3. **Natural Mergesort**:\n   - As we traverse the array, identify runs of already sorted elements. Merge these runs instead of fixed-size subarrays, which can reduce the number of merge operations.\n\n4. **Skip Unnecessary Merges**:\n   - During the merge step, if the largest element in the left half is smaller than the smallest element in the right half, the two halves are already in order, and we can skip the merge.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- **Divide Step**: Each division takes O(log n) steps.\n- **Conquer Step**: Sorting each subarray takes O(n) in the worst case due to the merge process.\n- **Merge Step Optimization**: The merge step still takes O(n), but practical performance is improved by reducing unnecessary operations.\n\nThus, the overall time complexity of the Optimized Merge Sort remains O(n log n), adhering to the given constraint while improving practical performance through various optimizations.\n\nBy combining these techniques, the Optimized Merge Sort algorithm efficiently sorts an array of integers with a time complexity of O(n log n), leveraging practical performance improvements to handle real-world data more effectively."

            "Answer: To find the longest palindromic substring efficiently, we can use an algorithm called \"Expand Around Center.\" This algorithm leverages the property of palindromes to check for palindromic substrings by expanding from the center outward. The key idea is that a palindrome mirrors around its center.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - `start` and `end` variables to keep track of the beginning and end indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n\n2. **Helper Function (expandAroundCenter)**:\n   - Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right)` that takes the string `s` and two indices `left` and `right`. This function will expand around these indices while the substring remains a palindrome.\n   - Inside this function, use a while loop to check if `s[left] == s[right]` and expand outwards by decrementing `left` and incrementing `right` until the characters are no longer equal or the indices go out of bounds.\n   - Return the length of the palindrome found by the expansion, which is `right - left - 1`.\n\n3. **Main Loop**:\n   - Iterate through each character in the string using an index `i`.\n   - For each character, consider it as the center of a palindrome. There are two cases:\n     - Odd-length palindromes, where the center is a single character (`left = i, right = i`).\n     - Even-length palindromes, where the center is between two characters (`left = i, right = i + 1`).\n   - For each case, call the `expandAroundCenter` function and calculate the length of the palindrome.\n   - Update the `start` and `end` indices if the current palindrome length is greater than the previous maximum length found.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - After iterating through the string, use the `start` and `end` indices to return the longest palindromic substring.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. Although this might seem inefficient, it is much faster than the brute-force approach and is often acceptable for practical purposes.\n\nHere is the algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    def expandAroundCenter(s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n\n    if not s or len(s) < 1:\n        return \"\"\n\n    start, end = 0, 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)         # Odd-length palindromes\n        len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)     # Even-length palindromes\n        max_len = max(len1, len2)\n        if max_len > end - start:\n            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n            end = i + max_len // 2\n\n    return s[start:end + 1]\n```\n\nIn summary, this algorithm efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring by expanding around potential centers and has a time complexity of O(n^2).",
            "Answer: To solve the problem of finding the longest palindromic substring efficiently, we can use an algorithm known as the \"Expand Around Center\" approach. This algorithm is both intuitive and efficient. Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including its steps, logic, and time complexity:\n\n### Algorithm Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Define a function `longestPalindrome(s)` that takes a string `s` as input.\n   - Initialize two variables, `start` and `end`, to keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.\n\n2. **Helper Function:**\n   - Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter(s, left, right)` that takes the string `s` and two indices `left` and `right` as input.\n   - This function will expand around the center indices `left` and `right` to find the longest palindrome centered at these indices.\n   - While expanding, check if the characters at the current `left` and `right` indices are equal. If they are, continue expanding by decrementing `left` and incrementing `right`.\n   - Return the length of the palindrome found.\n\n3. **Main Logic:**\n   - Iterate through each character in the string `s` using a loop.\n   - For each character, consider two cases for the center of the palindrome:\n     - Single center (`i, i`): This is for odd-length palindromes.\n     - Double center (`i, i + 1`): This is for even-length palindromes.\n   - For each center, use the `expandAroundCenter` function to find the longest palindrome centered at those indices.\n   - Update the `start` and `end` indices if a longer palindrome is found.\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - After iterating through all characters, return the substring of `s` from `start` to `end + 1` as the longest palindromic substring.\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    start, end = 0, 0\n    \n    def expandAroundCenter(s, left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)\n        len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)\n        max_len = max(len1, len2)\n        \n        if max_len > end - start:\n            start = i - (max_len - 1) // 2\n            end = i + max_len // 2\n    \n    return s[start:end + 1]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The time complexity of the \"Expand Around Center\" approach is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we potentially expand around each character and its adjacent pair, and each expansion can take up to `O(n)` time in the worst case.\n- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we only use a few extra variables and do not require additional space proportional to the input size.\n\nThus, the \"Expand Around Center\" approach provides an efficient and straightforward solution to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.",

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).\n\n### Example:\n\nFor the string \"babad\":\n- Center at index 0: \"b\" (len1 = 1)\n- Center at index 1 and 2: \"bab\" and \"aba\" (len2 = 3)\n- Center at index 3: \"a\" (len1 = 1)\n- Center at index 4: \"d\" (len1 = 1)\n\nThe longest palindromic substring is \"bab\" or \"aba\".\n\nThis algorithm ensures that we efficiently find the longest palindromic substring with a clear and logical approach, leveraging the property of palindromes expanding symmetrically from their center.",

Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) but performs well for small `n`.\n   ```python\n   def insertion_sort(arr, left, right):\n       for i in range(left + 1, right + 1):\n           key = arr[i]\n           j = i - 1\n           while j >= left and arr[j] > key:\n               arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n               j -= 1\n           arr[j + 1] = key\n   ```\n\n2. **Avoiding Additional Memory Allocation**:\n   - Use a single auxiliary array for merging, which is passed along the recursive calls.\n   ```python\n   def merge(arr, aux, left, mid, right):\n       for i in range(left, right + 1):\n           aux[i] = arr[i]\n       i, j, k = left, mid + 1, left\n       while i <= mid and j <= right:\n           if aux[i] <= aux[j]:\n               arr[k] = aux[i]\n               i += 1\n           else:\n               arr[k] = aux[j]\n               j += 1\n           k += 1\n       while i <= mid:\n           arr[k] = aux[i]\n           i += 1\n           k += 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Natural Merge Sort**:\n   - Enhance the algorithm to detect and utilize existing ordered sequences within the array.\n   ```python\n   def natural_merge_sort(arr):\n       aux = [0] * len(arr)\n       run = 1\n       while run < len(arr):\n           left = 0\n           while left < len(arr):\n               mid = min(left + run - 1, len(arr) - 1)\n               right = min((left + 2 * run - 1), (len(arr) - 1))\n               if mid < right:\n                   merge(arr, aux, left, mid, right)\n               left += 2 * run\n           run *= 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Parallel Processing**:\n   - Implement threading to parallelize the merge process.\n   ```python\n   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n   \n   def parallel_merge_sort(arr, aux, left, right):\n       if right - left + 1 <= 32:\n           insertion_sort(arr, left, right)\n           return\n       mid = (left + right) // 2\n       with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n           executor.submit(parallel_merge_sort, arr, aux, left, mid)\n           executor.submit(parallel_merge_sort, arr, aux, mid + 1, right)\n       merge(arr, aux, left, mid, right)\n   ```\n\n### Time Complexity:\n- **Divide Step**: O(log n) due to the recursive division.\n- **Merge Step**: O(n) for merging all levels of the recursion.\n- Thus, the overall time complexity remains O(n log n).\n\nBy incorporating these optimizations, the Merge Sort algorithm becomes more efficient and performs better in practical scenarios, particularly for large arrays and arrays with existing order.",
            "Answer: \n\nTo optimize the algorithm for sorting an array of integers to achieve a time complexity of O(n log n) or better, I will describe an optimized version of the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best). Here is a detailed explanation of the optimized Merge Sort algorithm and the techniques used:\n\n### Merge Sort Algorithm\n\n#### Overview\nMerge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting each sub-array, and then merging the sorted sub-arrays to produce the final sorted array.\n\n#### Steps Involved\n1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.\n3. **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves to produce the sorted array.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation\n\n1. **Divide**:\n   - If the array has more than one element, split it into two halves. This can be done by finding the middle index of the array.\n   - For an array `arr` of size `n`, the middle index is `mid = n // 2`.\n   \n2. **Conquer**:\n   - Recursively apply the Merge Sort algorithm to each half.\n   - This step ensures that the sub-arrays are broken down until they contain only one element (a single element array is trivially sorted).\n\n3. **Merge**:\n   - Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\n   - This involves comparing the elements of the sub-arrays and arranging them in order.\n   - Use two pointers to traverse the sub-arrays and build the merged array by selecting the smaller element from the current position of the pointers.\n\n#### Optimization Techniques\n\n1. **In-Place Merge**:\n   - Traditional Merge Sort uses O(n) extra space for merging sub-arrays. An in-place merge can reduce the space complexity.\n   - Use a technique called \"in-place merge\" to merge sorted sub-arrays without extra space.\n   - This technique involves shifting elements in the array to create space for merging, thereby reducing the need for additional arrays.\n\n2. **Iterative Merge Sort**:\n   - Instead of using recursive calls, which can lead to significant overhead due to function call stack usage, an iterative version can be implemented.\n   - Use a bottom-up approach where the array is sorted in small segments and then merged iteratively.\n\n3. **Hybrid Approach**:\n   - Combine Merge Sort with another sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort for small sub-arrays.\n   - Insertion Sort is efficient for small arrays due to low overhead. When the sub-array size is below a certain threshold (e.g., 32 elements), use Insertion Sort instead of Merge Sort.\n\n### Time Complexity\n- **Divide**: Each division operation takes O(1) time and there are log(n) levels of division.\n- **Conquer**: Each recursive call processes n elements, leading to O(n) work at each level.\n- **Merge**: Merging two sorted sub-arrays takes O(n) time.\n\nSince the array is split in half logarithmically and merging each level takes linear time, the overall time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```python\ndef merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    mid = len(arr) // 2\n    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])\n    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])\n    \n    return merge(left_half, right_half)\n\ndef merge(left, right):\n    merged = []\n    left_index, right_index = 0, 0\n    \n    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):\n        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:\n            merged.append(left[left_index])\n            left_index += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(right[right_index])\n            right_index += 1\n    \n    merged.extend(left[left_index:])\n    merged.extend(right[right_index:])\n    \n    return merged\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThe optimized Merge Sort algorithm described above achieves the desired time complexity of O(n log n) by using efficient division and merging techniques. The hybrid approach further optimizes performance by incorporating Insertion Sort for small sub-arrays, ensuring that the overall sorting process is as efficient as possible.",
            "Answer: \nTo optimize the sorting of an array of integers with a time complexity of O(n log n), we can leverage the Merge Sort algorithm, which inherently has this time complexity. However, we can introduce several optimizations to improve its practical performance. Below, I outline the steps involved, the logic behind the algorithm, and the optimizations used:\n\n### Merge Sort Algorithm with Optimizations\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer**: The basic idea of Merge Sort is to divide the array into two halves, sort each half recursively, and then merge the sorted halves back together.\n\n2. **Optimizations**:\n   - **Insertion Sort for Small Subarrays**: For small subarrays, it is more efficient to use Insertion Sort instead of Merge Sort. We can set a threshold (e.g., 32 elements) below which Insertion Sort is used. This reduces the overhead of recursive function calls and takes advantage of the low overhead of Insertion Sort for small arrays.\n   - **Avoid Unnecessary Copies**: During the merge process, we can avoid unnecessary copying of elements by using an auxiliary array only once. We alternate the roles of the original array and the auxiliary array during merging.\n   - **Natural Merge Sort**: Detect already sorted subarrays (runs) and merge them directly. This can help when the input array has some existing order.\n\n3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - **Step 1: Divide**: Recursively divide the array into halves until subarrays of size less than or equal to the threshold (e.g., 32) are obtained.\n   - **Step 2: Sort Small Subarrays**: Use Insertion Sort to sort these small subarrays.\n   - **Step 3: Merge**: Merge the sorted subarrays back together, alternating between the original array and an auxiliary array to minimize copying.\n\n4. **Detailed Explanation**:\n   - **Threshold for Insertion Sort**: Choose a small value, such as 32. When the subarray size is less than or equal to this threshold, apply Insertion Sort.\n   - **Auxiliary Array**: Allocate an auxiliary array of the same size as the original array. During merging, alternate between using the original array and the auxiliary array to avoid excessive copying.\n   - **Merge Function**: Implement a merge function that combines two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. Ensure the merge function is efficient by minimizing the number of element comparisons and moves.\n   - **Natural Merge Sort**: Traverse the array to identify already sorted runs and merge these runs directly. This can significantly speed up sorting for partially sorted inputs.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```plaintext\nfunction hybridMergeSort(arr):\n    if length of arr <= 32:\n        insertionSort(arr)\n        return\n\n    auxiliary = copy of arr\n    sort(arr, auxiliary, 0, length of arr - 1)\n\nfunction sort(arr, aux, low, high):\n    if high <= low:\n        return\n    if high - low <= 32:\n        insertionSort(arr, low, high)\n        return\n\n    mid = low + (high - low) / 2\n    sort(aux, arr, low, mid)\n    sort(aux, arr, mid + 1, high)\n    merge(arr, aux, low, mid, high)\n\nfunction merge(arr, aux, low, mid, high):\n    i = low\n    j = mid + 1\n    for k = low to high:\n        if i > mid:\n            arr[k] = aux[j++]\n        else if j > high:\n            arr[k] = aux[i++]\n        else if aux[j] < aux[i]:\n            arr[k] = aux[j++]\n        else:\n            arr[k] = aux[i++]\n\nfunction insertionSort(arr, low, high):\n    for i = low + 1 to high:\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= low and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j = j - 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n```\n\n### Time Complexity\nThe overall time complexity of the optimized Merge Sort remains O(n log n) due to the divide-and-conquer approach. The use of Insertion Sort for small subarrays does not affect the worst-case time complexity but improves the constant factors, making the algorithm more efficient in practice.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy combining Merge Sort with Insertion Sort for small subarrays and optimizing the merge process with an auxiliary array and natural merge sort techniques, we achieve an efficient and practical sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n). This approach leverages the strengths of both Merge Sort and Insertion Sort to provide better performance for a wide range of input sizes and characteristics.",
            "Answer: To optimize the algorithm for sorting an array of integers while ensuring a time complexity of O(n log n) or better, we can focus on enhancing existing algorithms. One of the most efficient and widely-used sorting algorithms with O(n log n) time complexity is Merge Sort. However, we can incorporate some optimizations from other sorting techniques to further improve its practical performance. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation of the optimized algorithm, which we will call \"Optimized Merge Sort\":\n\n### Optimized Merge Sort Algorithm\n\n1. **Divide and Conquer**:\n   - Similar to the standard Merge Sort, the array is recursively divided into two halves until each subarray contains a single element.\n\n2. **Insertion Sort for Small Subarrays**:\n   - For very small subarrays (e.g., arrays with fewer than 16 elements), use Insertion Sort instead of Merge Sort. Insertion Sort is generally faster for small arrays due to its lower overhead.\n   \n3. **Merge Step Optimization**:\n   - Instead of creating new arrays for each merge step, use a single auxiliary array that is reused for merging. This reduces the overhead of multiple memory allocations.\n   - Use a technique called \"natural mergesort,\" which takes advantage of existing runs (i.e., already sorted sequences) within the array to minimize the number of merges required.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Merges**:\n   - If the largest element in the left half is smaller than the smallest element in the right half, skip the merge step because the halves are already in order.\n\n### Steps Involved\n\n1. **Divide**:\n   - If the size of the subarray is less than a threshold (e.g., 16), use Insertion Sort to sort the subarray.\n   - Otherwise, divide the array into two halves.\n\n2. **Conquer**:\n   - Recursively sort the two halves using the optimized merge sort.\n\n3. **Merge**:\n   - Use the auxiliary array to merge the two halves.\n   - If the last element of the left half is smaller than the first element of the right half, skip the merge step.\n\n### Detailed Explanation\n\n1. **Insertion Sort for Small Subarrays**:\n   - Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), but for small n, the constant factors are smaller compared to other algorithms, making it faster in practice.\n\n2. **Single Auxiliary Array**:\n   - Allocate a single auxiliary array of the same size as the input array once and reuse it for each merge step. This reduces the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation, which can be significant for large arrays.\n\n3. **Natural Mergesort**:\n   - As we traverse the array, identify runs of already sorted elements. Merge these runs instead of fixed-size subarrays, which can reduce the number of merge operations.\n\n4. **Skip Unnecessary Merges**:\n   - During the merge step, if the largest element in the left half is smaller than the smallest element in the right half, the two halves are already in order, and we can skip the merge.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- **Divide Step**: Each division takes O(log n) steps.\n- **Conquer Step**: Sorting each subarray takes O(n) in the worst case due to the merge process.\n- **Merge Step Optimization**: The merge step still takes O(n), but practical performance is improved by reducing unnecessary operations.\n\nThus, the overall time complexity of the Optimized Merge Sort remains O(n log n), adhering to the given constraint while improving practical performance through various optimizations.\n\nBy combining these techniques, the Optimized Merge Sort algorithm efficiently sorts an array of integers with a time complexity of O(n log n), leveraging practical performance improvements to handle real-world data more effectively."
