Without treatment, the patient has a 50% chance of dying from the disease. With the drug, there is a 70% chance of curing the disease. Although there is a 30% chance of severe side effects from the drug, the chance of death from these side effects is only 10%. This equates to a 3% overall risk of death from the side effects (0.30 * 0.10). Therefore, the total probability of the patient surviving if given the drug is 97% (100% - 3%). Given these probabilities, administering the drug presents a significantly higher chance of survival (97%) compared to not treating the patient (50%). Thus, the optimal decision is to administer the drug.",
