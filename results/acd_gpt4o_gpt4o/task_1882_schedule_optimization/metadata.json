These are complex skills that demand the model to balance multiple constraints and priorities effectively. The estimated difficulty for humans is high, indicating that this task requires a significant level of cognitive effort.\n\n**Reasoning about the task:**\n\n1. **Logical Reasoning:**\n   - The LLM needs to interpret constraints and guidelines accurately.\n   - It must apply logical rules to ensure that mandatory tasks are completed and that priorities are respected.\n\n2. **Practical Problem-Solving:**\n   - The model has to distribute tasks over multiple days without exceeding the maximum hours per day or the maximum number of tasks per day.\n   - It must find a feasible solution that meets all given constraints.\n\n3. **Prioritization:**\n   - Tasks must be ordered based on their priority levels.\n   - The model needs to handle conflicts where high-priority tasks might not fit within the constraints of a single day.\n\nGiven the complexity and the multiple layers of constraints that need to be satisfied, this task is indeed challenging. The fact that the model succeeded means it effectively handled the logical reasoning, practical problem-solving, and prioritization aspects.\n\n**Considering the automatic scoring:**\n- The scoring method `eval_with_llm_judge` uses criteria based on the instructions.\n- If the criteria are well-defined and the LLM agent can interpret and apply them correctly, then the scoring should be reliable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe success of an LLM on a high-difficulty task involving multiple constraints and priorities is noteworthy. This indicates a significant capability in logical reasoning and problem-solving, which are advanced skills even for state-of-the-art LLMs.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
