Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'd' (4th letter).\n     - 'b' is the 2nd letter of the alphabet. Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'e' (5th letter).\n     - 'c' is the 3rd letter of the alphabet. Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'f' (6th letter).\n     - Therefore, 'abc' becomes 'def'.\n\n   - **Example 2: 'ghi' -> 'jkl'**\n     - 'g' is the 7th letter of the alphabet.

Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'l' (12th letter).\n     - Therefore, 'ghi' becomes 'jkl'.\n\n   - **Example 3: 'mno' -> 'pqr'**\n     - 'm' is the 13th letter of the alphabet. Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'p' (16th letter).\n     - 'n' is the 14th letter of the alphabet. Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'q' (17th letter).\n     - 'o' is the 15th letter of the alphabet. Shifting it 3 places forward gives 'r' (18th letter).\n     - Therefore, 'mno' becomes 'pqr'.",

This method can be effective if the LLM judge is capable of understanding and correctly evaluating the correctness and clarity of the rules identified by the agent.\n\nGiven these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it is:\n- **Not Surprising:** LLMs are generally good at identifying and applying simple, consistent patterns, and the examples provided do not appear to be exceedingly complex.\n\nDecision: No"
