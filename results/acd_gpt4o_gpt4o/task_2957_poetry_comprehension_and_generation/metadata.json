The speaker can only speculate about the potential future of each path, acknowledging that the true nature of each option remains hidden until experienced.\n\nThe themes of this excerpt include the inevitability of choices, the regret of not being able to explore all options, and the uncertainty of the future. Notable literary devices include imagery (\"yellow wood,\" \"undergrowth\") that sets the scene and evokes the natural world, and metaphor (the roads representing life choices).\n\nOriginal Poem:\nIn life, two paths before me lay,\nEach promising a different way.\nWith heavy heart, I pondered long,\nWhich road to take, which path is wrong?",

            "Interpretation:\n\nThe poem \"Hope is the thing with feathers\" by Emily Dickinson uses the metaphor of a bird to describe hope. The bird, representing hope, perches in the soul, symbolizing that hope resides within us. The bird's song, which lacks words, suggests that hope is an inherent, wordless feeling that persists regardless of circumstances. The phrase \"never stops at all\" emphasizes the enduring nature of hope, suggesting that it is a constant presence in our lives.\n\nThemes:\n1. Hope: The central theme of the poem is the enduring nature of hope, which is depicted as a constant and uplifting force.\n2. Resilience: The bird's continuous singing symbolizes resilience and the ability to remain hopeful even in difficult times.\n\nLiterary Devices:\n1. Metaphor: The bird with feathers is a metaphor for hope, providing a vivid image of its delicate yet persistent nature.\n2.
