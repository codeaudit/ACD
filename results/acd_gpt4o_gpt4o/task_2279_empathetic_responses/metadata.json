However, achieving nuanced and genuinely empathetic responses that avoid generic statements and fit specific contexts can be challenging.\n   - The task's estimated human difficulty is marked as \"difficult,\" which suggests that it is a challenging task even for humans, implying higher expectations for nuanced understanding and expression.\n\n2. **Implementation Evaluation**:\n   - The `get_instructions` method provides clear instructions, including the requirement for the response to be supportive, emotionally intelligent, and context-specific, avoiding generic statements.\n   - The `score` method uses `eval_with_llm_judge`, which evaluates based on the criteria outlined, including emotional intelligence and contextual appropriateness.\n\n3. **Suitability of LLM Judge**:\n   - Using an LLM judge to evaluate the criteria might be reasonable. LLMs can often recognize and judge the quality of empathetic responses, but they might not be perfect in judging nuanced emotional intelligence.\n   - Given the complexity of the task, there's a non-trivial chance that the LLM judge might miss subtle aspects of empathy or context-specific nuances.\n\n4. **Success of the LLM Agent**:\n   - If the LLM agent succeeded at generating an empathetic response that meets all the criteria (supportive, emotionally intelligent, contextually appropriate, non-generic, and at least 100 words), this is a noteworthy achievement. This is especially true given the estimated human difficulty being \"difficult.\"\n\n**Decision**: Yes"
