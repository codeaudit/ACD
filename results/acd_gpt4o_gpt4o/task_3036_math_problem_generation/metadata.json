Using an LLM to evaluate another LLM can sometimes lead to issues with subjective criteria such as \"originality\" and \"clarity.\"\n\n**Code Implementation**: The provided code seems correct in terms of task generation and instruction formatting. The evaluation criteria are clear and targeted towards both solving and generating problems.\n\nGiven these considerations, an LLM's success in this task would not be particularly surprising because:\n- The task involves basic mathematical reasoning and problem generation, which LLMs are generally capable of handling.\n- The criteria for evaluation are clear and can be reasonably met by an LLM.\n- The use of an LLM judge might help in providing a consistent evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the success of the LLM agent in this task is not particularly surprising or noteworthy.\n\nDecision: No"
