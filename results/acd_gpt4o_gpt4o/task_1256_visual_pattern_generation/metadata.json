This might introduce some variability, but it is assumed to be reliable for this assessment.\n\nGiven these points, an LLM's success in generating the described visual pattern is noteworthy due to the inherent difficulty in spatial reasoning and visual representation tasks for text-based models.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
