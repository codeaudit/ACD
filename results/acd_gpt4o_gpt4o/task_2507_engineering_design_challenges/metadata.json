            "Answer: \n\n### Conceptual Design\nThe proposed water filtration system is a multi-stage filtration setup that combines sediment filtration, activated carbon filtration, and a biosand filter. This design addresses the problem by ensuring that the water is filtered through multiple stages, each targeting different types of contaminants. The system is gravity-fed to eliminate the need for electrical power, making it suitable for a rural community with limited access to resources. The stages are arranged in series to maximize efficiency and ensure thorough purification of the water.\n\n### Technical Details\n1. **Sediment Filtration Stage**: This stage consists of a coarse filter made from layered gravel and fine sand to remove large particles and sediments from the water.\n   - **Specifications**: A cylindrical container (e.g., a 55-gallon drum) filled with layers of gravel (5 cm), coarse sand (10 cm), and fine sand (15 cm).\n   - **Considerations**: The layers should be arranged from coarse to fine to maximize sediment removal efficiency.\n\n2. **Activated Carbon Filtration Stage**: This stage uses activated carbon to adsorb organic contaminants, chlorine, and other chemicals.\n   - **Specifications**: A container filled with activated carbon granules of high surface area.\n   - **Considerations**: Regular replacement of activated carbon is necessary as it becomes saturated with contaminants.\n\n3. **Biosand Filter Stage**: This stage uses a slow sand filter that also incorporates a biological layer to remove pathogens and fine particles.\n   - **Specifications**: A concrete or plastic container (e.g., 200-liter drum) filled with fine sand and gravel, with a standing water layer on top to facilitate the formation of a biofilm.\n   - **Considerations**: Requires initial conditioning period for biofilm development. Regular maintenance involves cleaning the top layer of sand without disturbing the biological layer.\n\n### Materials and Resources\n1. **Gravel and Sand**: Locally sourced materials to reduce costs.\n   - **Reason**: Readily available and effective for sediment removal.\n2. **Activated Carbon**: Commercially available activated carbon or locally produced from coconut shells.\n   - **Reason**: High adsorption capacity for organic contaminants.\n3. **Containers**: Durable plastic or metal drums.\n   - **Reason**: Cost-effective and easily sourced.\n4. **Additional Components**: PVC pipes and fittings for water flow control.\n   - **Reason**: Inexpensive and easy to install.\n\n### Feasibility\n- **Cost**: The materials (gravel, sand, activated carbon, containers) are inexpensive and often locally available, keeping the overall cost low.\n- **Maintenance**: The system is designed to be low-maintenance. The sediment filter and biosand filter require periodic cleaning, while the activated carbon needs replacement when saturated.\n- **Capacity**: The system is capable of filtering at least 500 liters of water per day. Each stage is designed to handle a portion of this capacity, ensuring the entire system can meet the daily water needs of the community.\n- **Scalability**: The design can be scaled up or down depending on the community size and water needs, making it adaptable to different situations.\n\nBy combining these stages, the water filtration system meets the requirements for low cost, ease of maintenance, and sufficient capacity, making it a viable solution for providing clean water to a small rural community."
