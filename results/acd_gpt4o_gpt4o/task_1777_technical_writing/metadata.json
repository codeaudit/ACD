            "## Setting Up Your New Smartphone\n\nWelcome to your new smartphone! Follow these steps to set up your phone for the first time.\n\n### 1. Inserting the SIM Card\n\n1. **Locate the SIM card tray**: Find the SIM card tray on the side of your phone. You may need to use the SIM ejector tool provided in the box.\n2. **Eject the SIM card tray**: Insert the SIM ejector tool into the small hole next to the SIM card tray. Gently push until the tray pops out.\n3. **Place the SIM card**: Carefully place your SIM card into the tray. Ensure the gold contacts are facing down and the card fits snugly.\n4. **Reinsert the SIM card tray**: Gently push the tray back into the phone until it clicks into place.\n\n### 2.
