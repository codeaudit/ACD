The average global temperature has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past century. This has led to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods. Scientists are urging immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, there are significant impacts on biodiversity, agriculture, and human health. For example, the melting of polar ice caps has resulted in rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities.

Given that LLMs have been trained on a wide array of text, including fitness-related content, they should be capable of generating a reasonable workout routine that meets the specified criteria.\n\nThe code implementation appears correct and the `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to provide an automated scoring based on criteria that are well-defined and relevant to the task.
