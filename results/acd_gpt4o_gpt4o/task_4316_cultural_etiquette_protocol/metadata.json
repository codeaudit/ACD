            "When attending a formal dinner in Japan hosted by a traditional Japanese family, it is important to observe the following cultural etiquettes and protocols:\n\n1. **Greeting the Host:**\n   - Upon arrival, greet the host with a bow. The depth of the bow can signify the level of respect; a deeper bow shows greater respect.\n   - It is polite to say \"Konnichiwa\" (Good day) or \"Konbanwa\" (Good evening) depending on the time of day.\n   - If the host welcomes you into their home, it is customary to remove your shoes before entering and wear the provided indoor slippers. Make sure to place your shoes neatly at the entrance, pointing them away from the door.\n\n2. **Handling the Chopsticks:**\n   - Hold the chopsticks towards their end, not in the middle or near the tips.\n   - Do not point with your chopsticks or wave them around.\n   - Avoid sticking chopsticks upright into a bowl of rice, as this resembles a funeral rite and is considered very disrespectful.\n   - When not using your chopsticks, place them on the chopstick rest. If there is no rest, lay them neatly across your dish or at the edge of your plate.\n   - Do not pass food from one set of chopsticks to another, as this also resembles a funeral custom.\n\n3. **Specific Table Manners:**\n   - Wait for the host to start eating or to say \"Itadakimasu\" (I humbly receive) before you begin. This phrase is a way to show gratitude for the food.\n   - When drinking, it is polite to wait for everyone to be served and for a toast, often signaled by the word \"Kanpai\" (Cheers).\n   - Try to eat a little of everything offered to you as a sign of appreciation.\n   - Lift small bowls to your mouth to eat, especially for rice and soup, instead of leaning over the table.\n   - Avoid placing elbows on the table while eating.\n   - When finishing your meal, place your chopsticks back on the chopstick rest or lay them neatly across your dish to signify you are done. It is also customary to say \"Gochisousama deshita\" (Thank you for the meal) to express gratitude.\n\nBy following these etiquettes, you will show respect and appreciation for the Japanese culture and your hosts.",
            "When attending a formal dinner in Japan hosted by a traditional Japanese family, follow these etiquette guidelines:\n\n1. Greeting the Host:\n   - Bow respectfully upon arrival.\n   - Remove your shoes before entering the home and wear the provided slippers.\n   - Bring a small gift, present it with both hands and a slight bow, and say, \"Tsumaranai mono desu ga.\"\n\n2. Handling Chopsticks:\n   - Pick up and hold chopsticks properly, avoid pointing or waving them.\n   - Do not stick chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice.\n   - Place chopsticks on the rest when not in use.\n   - Avoid passing food directly between chopsticks.\n\n3. Specific Table Manners:\n   - Wait for the host to say \"Itadakimasu\" before starting the meal.\n   - Try a bit of everything and finish your plate.\n   - Pour drinks for others and let them pour for you.\n   - Say \"Gochisousama deshita\" at the end of the meal to thank the host.",

If there is no rest, lay them neatly across your dish or at the edge of your plate.\n   - Do not pass food from one set of chopsticks to another, as this also resembles a funeral custom.\n\n3. **Specific Table Manners:**\n   - Wait for the host to start eating or to say \"Itadakimasu\" (I humbly receive) before you begin. This phrase is a way to show gratitude for the food.\n   - When drinking, it is polite to wait for everyone to be served and for a toast, often signaled by the word \"Kanpai\" (Cheers).\n   - Try to eat a little of everything offered to you as a sign of appreciation.\n   - Lift small bowls to your mouth to eat, especially for rice and soup, instead of leaning over the table.\n   - Avoid placing elbows on the table while eating.\n   - When finishing your meal, place your chopsticks back on the chopstick rest or lay them neatly across your dish to signify you are done.

This involves contextual understanding, cultural knowledge, and social intelligence.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: LLMs have shown to be capable of understanding and generating contextually appropriate responses in various scenarios based on their training data, which includes a vast amount of information about different cultures and social norms.\n\n2. **Cultural Knowledge**: LLMs like GPT-3 have been trained on diverse datasets that include cultural etiquette and protocols from many countries. Thus, they likely have access to the necessary information to successfully perform this task.\n\n3. **Social Intelligence**: While this is a more nuanced capability, LLMs have demonstrated a reasonable ability to mimic social intelligence through pattern recognition in text data.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The task is scored using the `eval_with_llm_judge` method, which evaluates the response based on correctness, contextual appropriateness, and detail. Given that this is an LLM-judged evaluation, it is likely to be consistent with the capabilities of the evaluated LLM.\n\nConsidering these factors, the agent's success at the task is not surprising. LLMs are known to handle such tasks reasonably well due to their extensive training data and pattern recognition capabilities.\n\nDecision: No"
