For a 4x4 magic square using the numbers 1 to 16, the magic constant (sum of each row, column, and diagonal) can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Magic constant} = \\frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the size of the square. For a 4x4 square, the magic constant is:\n\\[ \\text{Magic constant} = \\frac{4(4^2 + 1)}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 17}{2} = 34 \\]\n\n2. Step-by-step solution:\nOne method to create a 4x4 magic square is to use the Siamese method or de La Loubere method, but adapted for a 4x4 grid. Another method is to use a known 4x4 magic square pattern.

            "1. Explanation of the approach:\nA magic square is a grid of numbers where the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. For a 4x4 magic square using the numbers 1 to 16, this common sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of numbers from 1 to 16 is 136, and since there are 4 rows, each row must sum to 136 / 4 = 34. We will follow a known algorithm to fill the 4x4 grid in such a way that all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to 34.\n\n2. Step-by-step solution:\nWe can use the following algorithm to generate a 4x4 magic square, known as the \"Method of De la Loubere\":\n1. Start by placing the number 1 in the middle of the top row.\n2. The next number is placed one row up and one column to the right. If this position is occupied or goes out of bounds, place the number directly below the current number.\n3. Continue this process until the grid is filled.\n\nHowever, another method specifically for 4x4 magic squares is the \"Method of Pairing\". This method involves filling the square in a specific pattern:\n1. Fill in the numbers 1 to 16 in order, left to right, top to bottom.\n2. Swap the corners and the centers of the corners.\n3. Swap the middle numbers of the first and last rows and columns.\n\n3.
