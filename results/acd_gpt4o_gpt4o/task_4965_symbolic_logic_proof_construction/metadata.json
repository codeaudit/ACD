            "content": "Given the nature of the task family \"symbolic_logic_proof_construction,\" it requires constructing formal proofs based on given logical statements using symbolic logic. This task measures logical reasoning, abstract thinking, and mathematical proof skills.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Task Complexity**: Constructing formal proofs, especially in symbolic logic, is a complex task that even advanced students or practitioners in fields like mathematics, computer science, or philosophy may find challenging. \n2. **Capability of LLMs**: While LLMs have shown competence in various natural language processing tasks, symbolic logic proof construction requires not only understanding the logical relationships but also applying formal rules in a rigorous manner. This is a higher-order cognitive task that goes beyond typical natural language understanding and generation.\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is marked as \"very difficult,\" which means it is challenging even for experts.\n4. **Automatic Scoring**: The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring the task relies on an LLM judge to evaluate the validity and structure of the logical proofs. While LLMs can handle many text-based evaluations, assessing the correctness of symbolic logic proofs demands precise logical analysis.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the above considerations, an LLM successfully constructing a valid formal proof in symbolic logic is surprising and noteworthy. This is because it demonstrates advanced logical reasoning and the ability to apply abstract formal rules correctly, which are not typically expected capabilities of current LLMs.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
