Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as inputs.\n\n2. **Loop until remainder is zero**: The `while b:` loop continues to execute as long as `b` is not zero. This is because the Euclidean algorithm relies on iterative division until the remainder is zero.\n\n3. **Update values**: Within the loop, the line `a, b = b, a % b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Here's what happens in this line:\n   - `b` becomes the new `a`.\n   - `a % b` (the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`) becomes the new `b`.\n\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` holds the GCD of the original pair of integers.\n\n5. **Return the GCD**: The function returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of the original input integers.\n\n### Why it works:\n- **Euclidean Algorithm**: The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. By repeatedly replacing the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number, we reduce the problem size at each step.\n- **Efficiency**: This algorithm is very efficient, with a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), making it suitable for large integers.\n\nThe function ensures correctness by adhering to the Euclidean algorithm, which has been mathematically proven to find the GCD of two numbers.",
            "Python Function:\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function `gcd` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are the integers for which we want to find the GCD.\n\n2. **Euclidean Algorithm**:\n   - The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Specifically, the GCD of `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and `a % b` (where `%` is the modulo operator).\n   - This property allows us to replace the pair `(a, b)` with `(b, a % b)` repeatedly until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` will be the GCD of the original pair.\n\n3. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `b` is not zero.\n   - Inside the loop, `a` is updated to the value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the value of `a % b`. This effectively reduces the problem size in each iteration.\n\n4. **Termination**:\n   - The loop terminates when `b` becomes zero. At this stage, `a` contains the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n5. **Return Value**:\n   - The function returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor of the input integers.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), making it suitable for large integers. This method is a classical and well-known approach for computing the GCD, ensuring both correctness and efficiency.",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input parameters.\n2. **Loop until `b` is zero**: The core of the algorithm is a loop that continues to execute as long as `b` is not zero.\n    - Within each iteration, the current values of `a` and `b` are updated.\n    - The value of `a` is set to the current value of `b`.\n    - The value of `b` is set to the remainder of the division of `a` by `b` (i.e., `a % b`).\n3. **Termination**: When `b` becomes zero, the loop terminates. At this point, `a` holds the GCD of the original pair of integers.\n4. **Return the result**: The function returns the value of `a` which is the GCD of the input integers.\n\n**Why it works**:\n- The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. In each iteration, the problem is reduced by replacing the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number.

            "Python Function:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    return b\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nF(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\n\nwhere F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.\n\nTo find the nth Fibonacci number efficiently, we use an iterative approach rather than a recursive one. The recursive approach has an exponential time complexity due to the repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers. Instead, the iterative approach has linear time complexity, O(n), which is much more efficient.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n1. First, we handle the base cases: if `n` is 0, we return 0; if `n` is 1, we return 1.\n2. We initialize two variables, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1 respectively. These variables will store the last two Fibonacci numbers.\n3. We then iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, we update `a` to the value of `b`, and `b` to the sum of the previous `a` and `b`. This effectively shifts the two variables forward in the Fibonacci sequence.\n4. After completing the loop, `b` will contain the nth Fibonacci number, which we return.\n\nThis method ensures that we only use a constant amount of extra space, O(1), making it both time and space efficient.",
            "Python Function:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    return b\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe provided function `fibonacci` computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:\n\n1. **Base Cases**: \n    - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0. This handles the case where the input is non-positive.\n    - If `n` is exactly 1, the function returns 1, as the first Fibonacci number is 1.\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation**:\n    - The function initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with the values 0 and 1, respectively. These variables represent the two most recent Fibonacci numbers in the sequence.\n    - A `for` loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration, the following operations are performed:\n        - The variable `a` is assigned the value of `b`.\n        - The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a + b` (the sum of the two most recent Fibonacci numbers).\n    - This loop effectively shifts the Fibonacci sequence forward by one position in each iteration, updating `a` and `b` to the next pair of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n3. **Return Value**:\n    - After completing the loop, the variable `b` holds the value of the nth Fibonacci number, which is then returned by the function.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient**:\n- **Time Complexity**: The function runs in O(n) time, as it requires a single loop that iterates `n` times.\n- **Space Complexity**: The function uses O(1) extra space, as it only needs a constant amount of space to store the two most recent Fibonacci numbers (`a` and `b`).\n\nThis iterative method avoids the exponential time complexity of the naive recursive approach, making it suitable for computing large Fibonacci numbers efficiently."
