LLMs, especially advanced ones, are generally good at language tasks, including idiomatic expressions, due to their extensive training on diverse text corpora.\n3. **Scoring Method**: The scoring is done using an LLM judge, which is appropriate for assessing language generation and interpretation tasks as it can evaluate the relevance and correctness of idiomatic expressions within context.\n\nBased on current knowledge about LLMs, the ability to generate idiomatic expressions and interpret them accurately is within their capabilities, though it can be challenging depending on the idiom's obscurity and context specificity. However, the success in generating idiomatic expressions for common contexts and interpreting well-known idioms is expected.\n\n**Decision: No**"
