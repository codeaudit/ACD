If necessary, guide evacuees to alternate exits to avoid the smoky areas. Begin closing off the affected area to prevent people from entering.\n\nStep 3: Continue monitoring the evacuation process, ensuring that people are moving quickly and safely to the designated assembly points outside the mall. Provide updates over the public address system to keep everyone informed and calm. Ensure that staff are helping those who need assistance, such as the elderly, disabled, and children.\n\nStep 4: Dispatch security personnel to search for the missing child, starting from the last known location. Simultaneously, announce a description of the child over the public address system and request all staff and security to be on the lookout. Coordinate with the fire department to ensure that the search does not hinder firefighting efforts. Keep the parents informed and reassured while the search is ongoing.",

Ensure that all emergency exits are accessible and guide people towards the exits. Communicate with store managers to ensure all employees and customers are informed and evacuating promptly.\n\nStep 3: Coordinate with security and staff to manage the flow of people evacuating the shops. Set up a command center at a safe distance from the fire to direct the evacuation and provide information. Use the public address system to give clear, calm instructions to evacuees, emphasizing the importance of moving quickly but safely.\n\nStep 4: Immediately alert security and staff to the report of the missing child. Assign a team to search for the child, focusing on areas where children are likely to be, such as restrooms and play areas.
