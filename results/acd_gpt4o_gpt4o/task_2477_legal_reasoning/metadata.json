            "1. **Review Your Lease Agreement:** \n   - Check the lease agreement to see the terms regarding rent increases. Most leases specify if and how much the rent can be increased during the lease term.\n\n2. **Understand Local Rent Control Laws:**\n   - Research your local rent control or rent stabilization laws. Some cities and states have regulations that limit how much a landlord can increase rent. For example, in California, the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 caps rent increases at 5% plus the local rate of inflation, or 10% of the lowest gross rental rate charged for the previous 12 months, whichever is lower.\n\n3. **Contact Your Landlord:**\n   - Communicate with your landlord to discuss the reason for the rent increase. Sometimes, landlords may be willing to negotiate or may provide justification that aligns with local laws.\n\n4. **File a Complaint with a Local Housing Authority:**\n   - If the rent increase appears to violate local rent control laws, you can file a complaint with your local housing authority or rent board. They can investigate and potentially mediate the situation.\n\n5. **Seek Legal Advice:**\n   - Consult with a tenant's rights attorney or a legal aid organization that specializes in housing issues. They can provide specific advice based on your situation and local laws.\n\n6. **Consider Joining a Tenants\u2019 Union:**\n   - Joining a tenants\u2019 union can provide additional support and resources. These organizations often have experience dealing with rent increases and can offer advice and advocacy.\n\n7. **Document Everything:**\n   - Keep detailed records of all communications with your landlord and any actions you take. This documentation can be crucial if you need to take legal action.\n\n8. **Prepare for Possible Consequences:**\n   - Be aware that challenging a rent increase could strain your relationship with your landlord. However, standing up for your rights is important, especially if the increase is unlawful.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your rights as a tenant are protected and that any rent increases are reasonable and lawful.",
            "As a tenant dealing with a significant and potentially unreasonable rent increase, you can take the following legal steps:\n\n1. **Review Your Lease Agreement**: Carefully read your lease agreement to understand the terms regarding rent increases. Some leases have specific clauses that limit how much rent can be increased and when.\n\n2. **Check Local Rent Control Laws**: Investigate if your city or state has rent control or rent stabilization laws. These laws often limit how much landlords can increase rent annually. For example, cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco have rent control regulations.\n\n3. **Communicate with Your Landlord**: Open a line of communication with your landlord to discuss the rent increase. Sometimes, landlords may be willing to negotiate the increase or provide justification for it.\n\n4. **Seek Mediation**: If direct negotiation is unsuccessful, consider using a mediation service. Many local housing authorities offer mediation services to help resolve disputes between tenants and landlords.\n\n5. **File a Complaint**: If you believe the rent increase violates local laws, you can file a complaint with your local housing authority or rent board. They can investigate the matter and determine if the increase is lawful.\n\n6. **Legal Action**: If all else fails, you may need to seek legal advice from a tenant rights attorney. They can provide guidance on whether you have grounds to challenge the increase in court.\n\n7. **Research State-Specific Regulations**: Different states have various tenant protections. For instance, California's Tenant Protection Act of 2019 caps annual rent increases at 5% plus the local rate of inflation, not exceeding 10%.\n\n8. **Consider Relocation**: As a last resort, if the rent increase is lawful but unaffordable, you might need to consider finding a new apartment within your budget.\n\nPotential Consequences:\n- **Positive**: Successfully negotiating or legally challenging the rent increase can result in more manageable rent.\n- **Negative**: Strained landlord-tenant relationship and potential eviction if the landlord finds another reason to terminate your lease.\n\nRemember, it is crucial to keep all communication with your landlord documented and to act within the legal timeframes specified by your local laws.",
            "1. **Review the Lease Agreement**: Start by carefully examining your lease agreement to understand the terms and conditions related to rent increases. The lease should specify how and when rent increases can be implemented.\n\n2. **Check Local Rent Control Laws**: Research local rent control laws or regulations. Some jurisdictions have rent control or rent stabilization laws that limit the amount and frequency of rent increases. Check with your local housing authority or a legal aid organization to see if such laws apply in your area.\n\n3. **Compare with Market Rates**: Investigate the current market rates for similar apartments in your area. If the increase is significantly higher than comparable rents, this information can be useful in negotiations with your landlord.\n\n4. **Negotiate with Your Landlord**: Open a dialogue with your landlord to discuss the rent increase. Present your findings from the market comparison and any relevant rent control laws. Express your concerns and try to negotiate a more reasonable increase.\n\n5. **Seek Mediation**: If negotiations with your landlord are unsuccessful, consider seeking mediation. Many communities offer free or low-cost mediation services to help resolve disputes between tenants and landlords.\n\n6. **File a Complaint**: If the rent increase violates local rent control laws, you can file a complaint with your local housing authority or rent control board. Provide documentation of the lease, the rent increase notice, and any relevant laws that the increase violates.\n\n7. **Consult a Lawyer**: If the issue remains unresolved, seek legal advice from a lawyer specializing in tenant rights.

This can help you understand the reason behind the rise and whether it\u2019s justified based on property improvements or market conditions.\n\n4. **Compare with Market Rates:**\n   - Research the rental rates of similar apartments in your area.

            "content": "Given the nature of the task family \"legal_reasoning,\" it is designed to measure the LLM's ability to provide legal advice and interpret complex legal language. This involves a deep understanding of legal principles, the ability to apply them to specific scenarios, and clear communication.\n\n1. **Task Complexity and Human Difficulty**: The task is described as \"very difficult\" for humans, implying that it requires specialized knowledge in law and the ability to reason through complex legal issues and terminology.\n\n2. **Capabilities of Current LLMs**: While LLMs have shown an impressive ability to understand and generate text across a wide range of topics, legal reasoning and advice is a particularly challenging domain. This is due to the precise and nuanced nature of legal language and the need for a deep understanding of specific legal contexts and jurisdictions.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The evaluation criteria are clear and comprehensive, focusing on the relevance and structure of the advice or interpretation provided by the LLM. The use of an LLM judge to evaluate these criteria might introduce some variability, but if the scoring function `eval_with_llm_judge` is robust and reliable, it should be able to effectively assess the quality of the responses.\n\n4. **Surprising or Noteworthy Success**: Given the high level of difficulty and the specialized knowledge required, an LLM successfully completing this task would be quite surprising and noteworthy. It indicates that the model can not only understand complex legal scenarios but also provide coherent and relevant legal advice, which is a significant leap in capability.\n\nConsidering these points, the LLM's success in this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
