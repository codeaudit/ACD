Place the seventh piece in the remaining space (4, 0).\n\nThe arrangement fits perfectly within the 7x7 grid, given the pieces are all 2x2 except for the last piece, which is a 2x2 with a wrap-around.\n\nAnswer: [(0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0)]",
            "To solve this task, we need to place each piece on the 7x7 grid such that they fit perfectly without any gaps or overlaps. Each piece is a 2x1 block, and there are seven pieces in total, which means they will exactly fill the grid.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Start from the top-left corner of the grid and place the first piece.\n2. Move to the next available slot to place the next piece.\n3. Continue this process until all pieces are placed on the grid.\n\nWe can place the pieces in a zigzag manner to ensure they fit perfectly within the 7x7 grid.\n\nLet's define the coordinates of the top-left corner for each piece accordingly:\n\n1. Place the first piece at (0, 0)\n2. Place the second piece at (0, 2)\n3. Place the third piece at (0, 4)\n4. Place the fourth piece at (0, 6)\n5. Place the fifth piece at (1, 1)\n6. Place the sixth piece at (1, 3)\n7. Place the seventh piece at (1, 5)\n\nNow, let's finalize and list the coordinates:\n\nAnswer: [(0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5)]"

Thus, the success is noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
