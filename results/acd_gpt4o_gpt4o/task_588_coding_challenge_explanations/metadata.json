            "Code: \n```python\ndef func(s):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse each word and join them back into a string with spaces\n    reversed_words = ' '.join(word[::-1] for word in words)\n    return reversed_words\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Splitting the String into Words**:\n   - The function starts by splitting the input string `s` into individual words. This is accomplished using the `split()` method, which by default splits the string at any whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) and returns a list of words.\n   - Example: If the input string is `\"Hello World\"`, after splitting, we get the list `['Hello', 'World']`.\n\n2. **Reversing Each Word**:\n   - Next, we need to reverse each word in the list. This is achieved using a generator expression inside the `join()` method.\n   - The expression `word[::-1]` reverses the word. The slice notation `[::-1]` means start from the end of the string and end at position 0, moving with the step -1 (which means one step backwards).\n\n3. **Joining the Reversed Words**:\n   - After reversing each word, we use the `' '.join()` method to join all the reversed words back into a single string with spaces in between.\n   - Example: If the list of reversed words is `['olleH', 'dlroW']`, joining them with spaces gives us the final string `\"olleH dlroW\"`.\n\n4. **Returning the Result**:\n   - Finally, the function returns the resulting string with the words reversed but still in their original order.\n\nIn summary, this function efficiently reverses each word in the input string while maintaining the original order of the words by leveraging Python's powerful string manipulation capabilities.",
            "Code:\n```python\ndef func(s):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse each word and join them back with a space\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(reversed_words)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Splitting the String into Words**: \n   - The function begins by splitting the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method. This method splits the string at each whitespace and creates a list of words. For example, if `s` is \"hello world\", `words` will be `['hello', 'world']`.\n\n2. **Reversing Each Word**:\n   - Next, we use a list comprehension to reverse each word in the list. The syntax `word[::-1]` reverses a string in Python. For each `word` in the `words` list, `word[::-1]` is applied, and the resulting reversed words are collected into a new list called `reversed_words`. For the example, `reversed_words` will be `['olleh', 'dlrow']`.\n\n3. **Joining the Reversed Words**:\n   - Finally, the list of reversed words is joined back into a single string using the `join` method with a space `' '` as the separator. This results in a single string where each word is reversed, but the order of the words remains the same. For our example, the result will be \"olleh dlrow\".\n\nThe function `func` thus takes a string, splits it into words, reverses each word individually, and then joins them back together, preserving the original word order but with each word reversed.",
            "Code:\n```python\ndef func(s):\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse each word in the list\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n    # Join the reversed words with spaces\n    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    return reversed_string\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` takes a single argument `s`, which is a string.\n2. **Splitting the String**: The function uses the `split` method on the string `s` to break it into a list of words. The `split` method without any arguments splits the string at any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines), which is what we need.\n   - Example: If `s = \"Hello World\"`, then `words = s.split()` would result in `words = ['Hello', 'World']`.\n3. **Reversing Each Word**: We use a list comprehension to iterate through each word in the `words` list and reverse it using slicing (`word[::-1]`). This creates a new list, `reversed_words`, where each word is reversed but retains its original position.\n   - Example: For `words = ['Hello', 'World']`, `reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]` results in `reversed_words = ['olleH', 'dlroW']`.\n4. **Joining Reversed Words**: The reversed words are joined back into a single string with spaces separating them using the `join` method. This is done by `' '.join(reversed_words)`.\n   - Example: For `reversed_words = ['olleH', 'dlroW']`, `reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)` results in `reversed_string = 'olleH dlroW'`.\n5. **Return the Result**: The function returns the `reversed_string`, which is the final output.",
            "Code: \n```python\ndef func(s):\n    return ' '.join(word[::-1] for word in s.split())\n```\n\nExplanation: \n1. **splitting the string into words**: We start by splitting the input string `s` into individual words using the `split()` method. This method breaks the string at each space and returns a list of words. For example, if the input is \"hello world\", `s.split()` will return `['hello', 'world']`.\n\n2. **reversing each word**: We then use a list comprehension to reverse each word in the list. The list comprehension iterates over each word in the split list and applies the slicing operation `word[::-1]`, which reverses the word. For instance, 'hello'[::-1] results in 'olleh'.\n\n3. **joining the reversed words**: Finally, we join the reversed words back into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method. The `join()` method takes an iterable (in this case, the list of reversed words) and concatenates them into a single string with spaces separating each word. \n\nPutting it all together:\n- Input: \"hello world\"\n- Split into words: ['hello', 'world']\n- Reverse each word: ['olleh', 'dlrow']\n- Join reversed words: \"olleh dlrow\"\n\nThus, the function `func` correctly returns the string with reversed words while maintaining their original order.",

The slice notation `word[::-1]` is used to reverse each word.\n   - Example: For the list `[\"hello\", \"world\"]`, the list comprehension `[word[::-1] for word in words]` will produce `['olleh', 'dlrow']`.\n\n3. **Joining the Reversed Words**:\n   - Finally, we use the `join()` method to concatenate the reversed words back into a single string, with each word separated by a space.\n   - Example: The list `['olleh', 'dlrow']` will be joined into the string `\"olleh dlrow\"`.\n\nThe function `func` thus returns the final string with each word reversed but still in the original order of appearance in the input string."

This is accomplished using the `split()` method, which by default splits the string at any whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) and returns a list of words.\n   - Example: If the input string is `\"Hello World\"`, after splitting, we get the list `['Hello', 'World']`.\n\n2. **Reversing Each Word**:\n   - Next, we need to reverse each word in the list. This is achieved using a generator expression inside the `join()` method.\n   - The expression `word[::-1]` reverses the word. The slice notation `[::-1]` means start from the end of the string and end at position 0, moving with the step -1 (which means one step backwards).\n\n3. **Joining the Reversed Words**:\n   - After reversing each word, we use the `' '.join()` method to join all the reversed words back into a single string with spaces in between.\n   - Example: If the list of reversed words is `['olleH', 'dlroW']`, joining them with spaces gives us the final string `\"olleH dlroW\"`.\n\n4. **Returning the Result**:\n   - Finally, the function returns the resulting string with the words reversed but still in their original order.\n\nIn summary, this function efficiently reverses each word in the input string while maintaining the original order of the words by leveraging Python's powerful string manipulation capabilities.",
            "Code:\n```python\ndef func(s):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse each word and join them back with a space\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(reversed_words)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Splitting the String into Words**: \n   - The function begins by splitting the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method. This method splits the string at each whitespace and creates a list of words. For example, if `s` is \"hello world\", `words` will be `['hello', 'world']`.\n\n2. **Reversing Each Word**:\n   - Next, we use a list comprehension to reverse each word in the list. The syntax `word[::-1]` reverses a string in Python. For each `word` in the `words` list, `word[::-1]` is applied, and the resulting reversed words are collected into a new list called `reversed_words`. For the example, `reversed_words` will be `['olleh', 'dlrow']`.\n\n3. **Joining the Reversed Words**:\n   - Finally, the list of reversed words is joined back into a single string using the `join` method with a space `' '` as the separator. This results in a single string where each word is reversed, but the order of the words remains the same. For our example, the result will be \"olleh dlrow\".\n\nThe function `func` thus takes a string, splits it into words, reverses each word individually, and then joins them back together, preserving the original word order but with each word reversed.",

The `split` method without any arguments splits the string at any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines), which is what we need.\n   - Example: If `s = \"Hello World\"`, then `words = s.split()` would result in `words = ['Hello', 'World']`.\n3. **Reversing Each Word**: We use a list comprehension to iterate through each word in the `words` list and reverse it using slicing (`word[::-1]`). This creates a new list, `reversed_words`, where each word is reversed but retains its original position.\n   - Example: For `words = ['Hello', 'World']`, `reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]` results in `reversed_words = ['olleH', 'dlroW']`.\n4. **Joining Reversed Words**: The reversed words are joined back into a single string with spaces separating them using the `join` method. This is done by `' '.join(reversed_words)`.\n   - Example: For `reversed_words = ['olleH', 'dlroW']`, `reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)` results in `reversed_string = 'olleH dlroW'`.\n5. **Return the Result**: The function returns the `reversed_string`, which is the final output.",

The list comprehension iterates over each word in the split list and applies the slicing operation `word[::-1]`, which reverses the word. For instance, 'hello'[::-1] results in 'olleh'.\n\n3. **joining the reversed words**: Finally, we join the reversed words back into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method. The `join()` method takes an iterable (in this case, the list of reversed words) and concatenates them into a single string with spaces separating each word. \n\nPutting it all together:\n- Input: \"hello world\"\n- Split into words: ['hello', 'world']\n- Reverse each word: ['olleh', 'dlrow']\n- Join reversed words: \"olleh dlrow\"\n\nThus, the function `func` correctly returns the string with reversed words while maintaining their original order.",
