Given the subjective nature of empathy and social reasoning, relying on another LLM to judge could introduce bias or variability in scoring.\n\n4. **Expected LLM Performance**:\n   - Modern LLMs are typically capable of generating advice that appears empathetic and supportive due to their training on diverse datasets. However, the depth and authenticity of this empathy can be questioned. \n\nConsidering these points, if the LLM succeeded at the task, it would align with its known capabilities in generating text that appears empathetic and supportive.
