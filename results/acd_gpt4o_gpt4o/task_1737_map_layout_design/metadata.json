This is a challenging task, as it requires the model to visualize and structure elements in a spatial context.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Current large language models are proficient at understanding and generating human-like text.

However, spatial reasoning and visual thinking are not their strong suits, as these are more aligned with visual processing, which is outside the core capability of LLMs.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is described as difficult for humans, indicating it requires significant cognitive effort to visualize and describe spatial arrangements accurately.\n\n4. **Evaluation**: The task is automatically scored using an LLM judge, which evaluates the clarity, structure, and logic of the submission. While LLM judges can be effective in assessing textual coherence and adherence to given criteria, they may struggle with nuanced aspects of spatial reasoning.\n\nConsidering the above points, the fact that the LLM agent succeeded in this task is noteworthy.
