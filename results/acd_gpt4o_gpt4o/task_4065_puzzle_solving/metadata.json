            "content": "Given the task family \"puzzle_solving,\" let's consider the following points:\n\n1. **Task Complexity and LLM Capabilities**: The described task involves solving a sliding puzzle (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4 grid) by determining the correct sequence of moves. This requires logical reasoning, problem-solving, and strategic planning. While LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding and generating text, solving such puzzles introduces a more complex challenge that involves spatial reasoning and step-by-step planning.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is labeled as \"difficult\" for humans, which implies that it requires significant cognitive effort and problem-solving skills. If a task is difficult for humans, it is reasonable to assume it might be challenging for LLMs as well, especially since it goes beyond typical natural language understanding tasks.\n\n3. **Automatic Scoring**: The `score` method uses an LLM-based judge (`eval_with_llm_judge`) to evaluate whether the solution meets the criteria. While LLMs can evaluate text-based instructions, verifying the correctness of a sequence of puzzle moves might be more challenging and error-prone if the judge is not well-calibrated for such tasks.\n\n4. **Success on the Task**: The LLM agent succeeded in solving the puzzle, which involves correctly arranging numbers in ascending order with the empty space at the end. This success indicates that the LLM was able to understand the instructions, plan the sequence of moves, and ensure the moves were logically coherent and correct according to the puzzle rules.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM on this task is indeed surprising and noteworthy. Solving a sliding puzzle is a complex problem that requires more than just language understanding; it involves strategic and logical planning, which are non-trivial capabilities for an LLM.\n\nTherefore, my decision is:\n\nDecision: Yes"
