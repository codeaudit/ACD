Summarizing legal clauses accurately and drafting new clauses based on specific requirements are tasks that typically demand a high level of comprehension, precision, and familiarity with legal terminology and conventions.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Modern LLMs, especially advanced ones like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding and generating formal and complex text, including legal language. They are trained on a broad range of data, including formal and legal texts, which gives them a reasonable foundation to tackle such tasks.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task is scored using the function `eval_with_llm_judge`, which implies another LLM is used to evaluate the submission. While LLMs can be quite effective in evaluating text based on predefined criteria, the efficacy of this method depends on how well the evaluation criteria are defined and whether the LLM judge can accurately assess the nuances of legal language and requirements.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: While the task is marked as difficult for humans, it is not uncommon for advanced LLMs to perform well on such tasks due to their extensive training.\n\nIn this context, an LLM successfully summarizing a legal clause in plain language and drafting a clause according to specific requirements is impressive but not entirely surprising given the capabilities of advanced LLMs in handling complex and formal language tasks.\n\nDecision: No"
