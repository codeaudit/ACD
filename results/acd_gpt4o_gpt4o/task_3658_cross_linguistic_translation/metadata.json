Both proverbs encourage diligence and taking advantage of opportunities that come with being early, though the Japanese version highlights the idea of gaining a small but certain benefit, reflecting a cultural appreciation for consistent, incremental gains rather than a single, substantial reward.",

            "1. Translation: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\n2. Cultural Context: This Spanish proverb, \"A caballo regalado no se le mira el diente,\" translates directly to \"You don't look at the teeth of a gifted horse.\" In both Spanish and English, this saying means that one should not criticize or question the value of a gift. The origins of the phrase come from the practice of inspecting a horse's teeth to determine its age and health. By looking at the teeth of a gifted horse, one would be seen as ungrateful or overly critical.

The phrase originates from the practice of assessing a horse's age and health by examining its teeth. In both cultures, the underlying message is about gratitude and graciousness in accepting gifts without scrutinizing their value.

This is because checking a horse's teeth is a way to gauge its age and health, and doing so with a gifted horse would be seen as ungrateful. The cultural nuance here lies in the universal value of gratitude and appreciation for gifts, regardless of their imperfections.
