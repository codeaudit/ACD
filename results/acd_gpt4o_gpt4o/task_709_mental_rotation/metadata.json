Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Capabilities of LLMs**: LLMs generally excel at natural language processing tasks but often struggle with tasks requiring strong spatial reasoning or visual imagination. Mentally rotating geometric shapes and accurately describing their new orientations involves spatial reasoning, which is not a core strength of LLMs.\n   \n2. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be of moderate difficulty for humans, suggesting that even humans might need some effort to accurately perform these tasks. This further implies that success in this task by an LLM might be less expected.\n\n3. **Task Instructions and Evaluation**: The instructions are clear and detailed, but the task relies on an LLM judge to evaluate the correctness and clarity of the new orientation description. If the LLM judge can accurately assess these criteria, it adds a layer of complexity to the evaluation process.\n\n4. **Agent's Success**: Given that LLMs typically struggle with spatial reasoning, success in this task indicates that the model might possess a higher level of spatial reasoning and visual imagination than generally expected.\n\nConsidering these points, the LLM's success in accurately mentally rotating and describing geometric shapes is indeed noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
