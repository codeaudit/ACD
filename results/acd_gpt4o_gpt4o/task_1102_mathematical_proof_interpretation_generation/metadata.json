However, there are several considerations to take into account:\n\n1. **LLM Capabilities**: Modern LLMs, particularly advanced ones, have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and generating complex text, including mathematical concepts and logical reasoning. They can often follow logical structures and provide detailed explanations.\n\n2. **Example Provided**: The example proof given in the task (\"Let x be an element of a set S. Assume that for all y in S, x+y is also in S. Prove that S is closed under addition.\") is a relatively straightforward proof in set theory, which might not be as difficult for a well-trained LLM as more complex or intricate mathematical proofs.\n\n3. **LLM Judge**: The use of an LLM judge for evaluation is appropriate in this context, as it can assess the logical structure and thoroughness of the explanation or generated proof. The criteria for evaluation are clear and well-defined, which aids in consistent scoring.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: While the task is estimated to be very difficult for humans, LLMs trained on extensive mathematical and logical text might find this within their capabilities, particularly if they have been fine-tuned on similar tasks.\n\nGiven these points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not particularly surprising. Advanced LLMs have shown proficiency in tasks requiring logical reasoning and mathematical knowledge, and the example proof is not exceedingly complex.\n\nDecision: No"
