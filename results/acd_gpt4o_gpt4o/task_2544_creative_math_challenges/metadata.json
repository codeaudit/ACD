Rope A, burning from both ends, will take 30 minutes to burn completely because burning from both ends accelerates the burning time.\n3. When Rope A has completely burned out, 30 minutes have passed.\n4. At this moment, light the other end of Rope B (which is already burning from one end).\n5. Rope B, now burning from both ends, will take an additional 15 minutes to burn completely because it has already been burning for 30 minutes and has 30 minutes worth of rope left. Burning from both ends will halve this remaining time.\n\nAdding up these intervals gives you 30 minutes (from Rope A) + 15 minutes (from Rope B burning from both ends), totaling 45 minutes.\n\nAnswer: Light Rope A at both ends and Rope B at one end. When Rope A burns out (after 30 minutes), light the other end of Rope B. Rope B will then burn out in another 15 minutes, giving a total of 45 minutes.",
            "To measure exactly 45 minutes using the two ropes, follow these steps:\n\n1. Light Rope A at both ends and Rope B at one end simultaneously.\n2. Since Rope A is lit at both ends, it will take half the time to burn completely compared to being lit at one end. Therefore, Rope A will burn completely in 30 minutes.\n3. When Rope A has completely burned out (after 30 minutes), immediately light the other end of Rope B.\n4. Now, Rope B is burning from both ends, and since it has already been burning for 30 minutes, it has 30 minutes of burning left. But because it is now burning from both ends, it will take only 15 more minutes to burn completely.\n5. The total time elapsed is 30 minutes (from burning Rope A and one end of Rope B) plus 15 minutes (from burning both ends of Rope B), which equals 45 minutes.\n\nAnswer: Light Rope A at both ends and Rope B at one end simultaneously. When Rope A has completely burned out (after 30 minutes), light the other end of Rope B. Rope B will then take 15 more minutes to burn completely, making a total of 45 minutes."
