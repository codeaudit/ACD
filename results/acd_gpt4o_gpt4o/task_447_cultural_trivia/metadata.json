            "content": "Given the task family \"cultural_trivia\" and the capabilities of large language models (LLMs):\n\n1. **Task Nature**: The task involves answering cultural trivia questions, which generally rely on a substantial knowledge base and the ability to articulate responses clearly. LLMs are typically trained on a diverse and extensive dataset, including vast amounts of cultural and historical information.\n\n2. **Estimated Difficulty**: The human difficulty is estimated as moderate, implying that the questions are not extremely challenging for someone reasonably knowledgeable in the domain.\n\n3. **Capabilities Measured**: Knowledge, cultural awareness, and articulation are key capabilities being measured here. LLMs, especially advanced ones, are quite proficient in retrieving and generating accurate information about cultural topics due to their training data.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The task uses an automatic scoring method `eval_with_llm_judge`, which might raise concerns about the subjective nature of cultural trivia answers. However, assuming the judge is well-calibrated, it should provide a fair evaluation of the responses.\n\nOverall, given that LLMs are designed to handle tasks requiring extensive knowledge and clear articulation, success in this task is not surprising.\n\n**Decision: No**"
