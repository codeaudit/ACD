Since the boat can only carry one person at a time, we need to figure out the optimal way to use the boat to minimize the total crossing time.\n\nHere are the steps to achieve the minimum crossing time:\n\nStep 1: A crosses the river alone (1 minute).\n- Now A is on the other side, and B and C are still on the original side.\n- Time elapsed: 1 minute.\n\nStep 2: A returns with the boat (1 minute).\n- Now A, B, and C are all on the original side again.\n- Time elapsed: 2 minutes.\n\nStep 3: B crosses the river alone (2 minutes).\n- Now B is on the other side, and A and C are still on the original side.\n- Time elapsed: 4 minutes.\n\nStep 4: B returns with the boat (2 minutes).\n- Now A, B, and C are all on the original side again.\n- Time elapsed: 6 minutes.\n\nStep 5: C crosses the river alone (5 minutes).\n- Now C is on the other side, and A and B are still on the original side.\n- Time elapsed: 11 minutes.\n\nStep 6: A returns with the boat (1 minute).\n- Now A and B are on the original side, and C is on the other side.\n- Time elapsed: 12 minutes.\n\nStep 7: A crosses the river alone (1 minute).\n- Now A and C are on the other side, and B is on the original side.\n- Time elapsed: 13 minutes.\n\nStep 8: B crosses the river alone (2 minutes).\n- Now all three (A, B, and C) are on the other side of the river.\n- Time elapsed: 15 minutes.\n\nThus, the minimum time required for all three people to cross the river is 15 minutes.\n\nAnswer: 15 minutes.",

Let\u2019s consider a different approach:\n\n1. Person A (1 minute) and Person B (2 minutes) cross together, taking 2 minutes.\n   - Time elapsed: 2 minutes\n   - Persons on each side: [A, B] / [C]\n\n2.

Person A (1 minute) and Person B (2 minutes) cross together again, taking 2 minutes.\n   - Time elapsed: 12 minutes\n   - Persons on each side: [A, B, C] / []\n\nUsing this optimized approach, the minimum time required for all three to cross the river is 12 minutes. \n\nAnswer: 12 minutes",
            "Solution: To solve this puzzle, we need to minimize the total crossing time for all three people while adhering to the constraint that the boat can only carry one person at a time. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Let's denote the three people by A, B, and C, with crossing times of 1 minute, 2 minutes, and 5 minutes respectively.\n2. We need to consider the various combinations and sequences of crossings to find the minimum total time.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **A crosses to the other side (1 minute)**:\n   - A is on the other side.\n   - Total time: 1 minute\n\n2. **A returns to the starting side (1 minute)**:\n   - A is back on the starting side.\n   - Total time: 2 minutes\n\n3. **B crosses to the other side (2 minutes)**:\n   - B is on the other side.\n   - Total time: 4 minutes\n\n4. **A returns to the starting side (1 minute)**:\n   - A is back on the starting side.\n   - Total time: 5 minutes\n\n5. **C crosses to the other side (5 minutes)**:\n   - C is on the other side.\n   - Total time: 10 minutes\n\n6. **A returns to the starting side (1 minute)**:\n   - A is back on the starting side.\n   - Total time: 11 minutes\n\n7. **A crosses to the other side (1 minute)**:\n   - A is on the other side.\n   - Total time: 12 minutes\n\n### Verification:\n- Each step is logical and adheres to the constraint that the boat can only carry one person at a time.\n- The total time for all three persons (A, B, C) to cross the river is 12 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum time required for all three to cross the river is 12 minutes.\n\nAnswer: 12 minutes",
            "Solution: To find the minimum time required for all three people to cross the river, we need to strategize the crossings efficiently. Let's denote the three people by A (1 minute), B (2 minutes), and C (5 minutes).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **A and B cross the river**: Since A and B have times 1 and 2 minutes respectively, the crossing will take 2 minutes (the slower person's pace).\n2. **A returns**: A takes the boat back alone, which takes 1 minute.\n3. **C crosses the river**: Now C (5 minutes) crosses the river alone, taking 5 minutes.\n4. **B returns**: B takes the boat back alone, taking 2 minutes.\n5. **A and B cross the river again**: Finally, A and B cross together again, taking another 2 minutes.\n\nLet's calculate the total time:\n\n- Step 1: A and B cross (2 minutes)\n- Step 2: A returns (1 minute)\n- Step 3: C crosses (5 minutes)\n- Step 4: B returns (2 minutes)\n- Step 5: A and B cross again (2 minutes)\n\nTotal time = 2 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 12 minutes\n\nBy following this plan, all three people will be able to cross the river in the minimum time possible.\n\nAnswer: 12 minutes",
            "Solution: To solve this puzzle, we need to minimize the total time taken for all three people (let's call them A, B, and C) to cross the river. Let's assign the crossing times as follows:\n- Person A: 1 minute\n- Person B: 2 minutes\n- Person C: 5 minutes\n\nGiven that the boat can only carry one person at a time, we need to carefully strategize who crosses and returns with the boat to minimize the total crossing time.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan with reasoning:\n\n1. **A crosses first (1 minute):**\n   - Time elapsed: 1 minute\n   - A is on the other side, B and C are on the starting side.\n\n2. **A returns with the boat (1 minute):**\n   - Time elapsed: 2 minutes\n   - A, B, and C are all on the starting side again.\n\n3. **B crosses next (2 minutes):**\n   - Time elapsed: 4 minutes\n   - B is on the other side, A and C are on the starting side.\n\n4. **A returns with the boat (1 minute):**\n   - Time elapsed: 5 minutes\n   - A, B, and C are all on the starting side again.\n\n5. **C crosses next (5 minutes):**\n   - Time elapsed: 10 minutes\n   - C is on the other side, A and B are on the starting side.\n\n6. **A returns with the boat (1 minute):**\n   - Time elapsed: 11 minutes\n   - A is on the starting side, B and C are on the other side.\n\n7. **A crosses again (1 minute):**\n   - Time elapsed: 12 minutes\n   - A is on the other side, B and C are on the other side.\n\nThis approach yields a total time of 12 minutes, which is the minimum time required for all three to cross the river given the constraints."
