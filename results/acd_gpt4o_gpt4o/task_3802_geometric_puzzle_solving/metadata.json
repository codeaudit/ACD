            "Answer: \nShape Arrangement: The shapes are arranged such that each one is nested within the other in a specific order. The outermost shape is the square, followed by the hexagon, then the circle, and finally the triangle at the center.\nRelationships: The square completely encloses the hexagon, the hexagon completely encloses the circle, and the circle completely encloses the triangle. Each shape is nested within the previous one without any gaps or overlaps beyond the nesting.",
            "Answer: \n\nShape Arrangement: The square should be the outermost shape, containing all the other shapes. Inside the square, the hexagon should be placed, followed by the circle inside the hexagon, and finally, the triangle should be nested inside the circle.\n\nRelationships: The shapes are nested within each other, starting with the square containing the hexagon, the hexagon containing the circle, and the circle containing the triangle, forming a nested pattern."

The oval should overlap both the rectangle and the diamond, covering the central area where the rectangle and diamond meet. Finally, the pentagon should be placed on top, overlapping the upper part of the oval.\n\nRelationships: The rectangle and diamond have an overlapping relationship, with the diamond positioned on top of the rectangle. The oval overlaps both the rectangle and the diamond, creating a central overlapping region. The pentagon overlaps the upper part of the oval, adding another layer of overlap to the arrangement.",

Start with the rectangle, which will overlap with the diamond. The diamond will then overlap with the oval, and the oval will overlap with the pentagon.\n\nRelationships: The rectangle overlaps with the diamond, the diamond overlaps with the oval, and the oval overlaps with the pentagon. Each pair of adjacent shapes in the sequence has an overlapping relationship, ensuring the entire set follows the overlapping pattern."
