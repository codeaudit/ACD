Determine all possible values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that \\( N \\) is divisible by 5.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions under which \\( p^2 + q^2 \\) is divisible by 5. \n\nFirst, observe the behavior of the squares of numbers modulo 5. The squares of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 modulo 5 are:\n- \\( 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 4^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\)\n\nThus, the possible values of \\( p^2 \\) and \\( q^2 \\) modulo 5 are 0, 1, and 4. For \\( N = p^2 + q^2 \\) to be divisible by 5, we need:\n\\[ p^2 + q^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nThis means that the sum of \\( p^2 \\) and \\( q^2 \\) must be congruent to 0 modulo 5. The pairs of residues that satisfy this condition are:\n- \\( (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( (1, 4) \\)\n- \\( (4, 1) \\)\n\nNext, we identify the prime numbers less than 5 and their corresponding squares modulo 5:\n- \\( 2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) (but 5 is not less than 5)\n- \\( 7 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\) (7 is not less than 5)\n\nHowever, since we are looking for distinct primes such that \\( p < q \\), we restrict our choices to the primes 2 and 3.\n\nBy checking the pairs:\n- \\( p = 2 \\) and \\( q = 3 \\)\n\\[ 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \\]\n\\[ 13 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nSince no valid pairs exist with primes less than 5 that satisfy the condition, we extend our search to primes greater than 5 but less than 10:\n- \\( 7 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5} \\)\n- \\( 11 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\)\n\nChecking the pair:\n- \\( p = 7 \\) and \\( q = 11 \\)\n\\[ 7^2 + 11^2 = 49 + 121 = 170 \\]\n\\[ 170 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\]\n\nThus, the only valid pair is \\( p = 7 \\) and \\( q = 11 \\).\n\nAnswer: \\( p = 7 \\) and \\( q = 11 \\) are the prime numbers such that \\( N = p^2 + q^2 \\) is divisible by 5.",

            "content": "Given the task family `math_problem_creation`, let's analyze the capabilities being measured, the complexity of the task, and the evaluation method.\n\n### Task Analysis\n- **Capabilities Being Measured**: The task measures mathematical creativity, problem formulation, and domain knowledge.\n- **Estimated Human Difficulty**: The task is considered difficult for humans, which means it likely requires a deep understanding of mathematics and the ability to craft novel problems.\n- **Example Instructions**: The instructions are clear and provide a concrete example of what is expected.\n\n### Evaluation Method\n- **Automatic Scoring**: The `score` method uses an LLM-based judge to evaluate the submissions based on specified criteria. The criteria are:\n  1. Clarity and understandability of the problem.\n  2. Adherence to the given topic and constraint.\n  3. Novelty and interest of the problem.\n  4. Correctness and explanation of the solution.\n\n### Reasoning about LLM Capabilities\n- **Mathematical Creativity**: LLMs have shown some capability in generating creative text, but mathematical creativity specifically is a more nuanced and challenging skill.\n- **Problem Formulation**: LLMs can formulate problems if they have sufficient training data in mathematical contexts, but ensuring correctness and novelty is more difficult.\n- **Domain Knowledge**: LLMs typically have a substantial amount of mathematical knowledge, but applying this knowledge to create novel problems is a higher-order skill.\n\n### Evaluation Suitability\n- **LLM Judge**: The use of an LLM to evaluate another LLM's output introduces some complexity. The LLM judge must be capable of accurately assessing the novelty, adherence to constraints, and correctness of mathematical solutions, which is non-trivial.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the task's complexity and the high-level capabilities required (creativity, formulation, domain knowledge), it is noteworthy that the agent succeeded, especially since the evaluation relies on another LLM. Success in such a task suggests the agent has a strong grasp of the context and can apply its knowledge creatively and correctly.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
