Let's break down each step of the proof to verify its correctness:\n\n1. **Definition of Even Numbers**:\n   - The proof begins by defining two even numbers as \\(2m\\) and \\(2n\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers. This is correct because any even number can be expressed as 2 times an integer.\n\n2. **Sum of Two Even Numbers**:\n   - The sum of the two even numbers is calculated as \\(2m + 2n\\). This is straightforward arithmetic.\n\n3. **Factoring Out the Common Factor**:\n   - The common factor of 2 is factored out from \\(2m + 2n\\), resulting in \\(2(m + n)\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion that the Sum is Even**:\n   - The expression \\(2(m + n)\\) is clearly an even number because it is 2 times the integer \\((m + n)\\). Since the sum is in the form of \\(2 \\times \\text{integer}\\), it must be even.\n\nEach step follows logically from the previous one, and the use of definitions and arithmetic operations is correct. Therefore, the proof correctly demonstrates that the sum of any two even numbers is even.",
            "Correctness: Correct\nExplanation: The proof provided is logically consistent and mathematically accurate. The proof starts by expressing two even numbers as 2m and 2n, where m and n are integers, which is correct because any even number can be written as 2 times an integer. Then, it correctly adds these two even numbers to obtain 2m + 2n. The next step is factoring out the common factor of 2, resulting in 2(m + n). Since m and n are integers, their sum (m + n) is also an integer. Therefore, 2(m + n) is an even number because it is 2 times an integer.

Therefore, the first even number can be written as 2m, and the second even number can be written as 2n, where m and n are integers.\n\n2. Summing the two even numbers: The sum of the first even number (2m) and the second even number (2n) is given by:\n   \\[ 2m + 2n. \\]\n\n3. Factoring out the common factor: The expression 2m + 2n can be factored as:\n   \\[ 2(m + n). \\]\n\n4. Analysis of the resulting expression: The expression 2(m + n) is of the form 2 times an integer (since m + n is an integer, as the sum of two integers is an integer).\n\n5.
