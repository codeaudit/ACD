In this case, \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Calculation of \\( c \\) Using the Pythagorean Theorem**:\n   - To verify the theorem, we need to determine the value of \\( c \\) when \\( a = 3 \\) and \\( b = 4 \\). According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n     \\]\n     Substituting the given values:\n     \\[\n     c = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     c = \\sqrt{9 + 16}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     c = \\sqrt{25}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     c = 5\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verification of the Theorem with Calculated \\( c \\)**:\n   - The final step is to verify that \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) equals \\( c^2 \\) with the calculated value of \\( c \\). We substitute \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\) into the original equation:\n     \\[\n     a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     9 + 16 = 25\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     25 = 25\n     \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the proof verifies that the Pythagorean theorem holds true for the given values.\n\nAnswer: The given mathematical proof is correct. The proof accurately follows the steps of the Pythagorean theorem by assigning specific values to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), calculating \\( c \\), and verifying that \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\) holds true for the given right triangle with \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = 4 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\)."
