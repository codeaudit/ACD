The rows are arranged such that:\n- The first row starts with a red circle and alternates with blue squares.\n- The second row starts with a blue square and alternates with red circles.\n- The third row starts with a red circle and alternates with blue squares.\n- The fourth row starts with a blue square and alternates with red circles.\n\nThe pattern of alternation continues consistently in each row.\n\nPrediction:\nThe next row in the sequence would follow the same alternation rule and start with a red circle (since the sequence of starting shapes/colors restarts every two rows), resulting in: red circle, blue square, red circle, blue square.",
            "Pattern Description:\nA 4x4 grid where each row alternates between red circles and blue squares. The first row starts with a red circle, the second row starts with a blue square, the third row starts with a red circle, and the fourth row starts with a blue square.\n\nExplanation:\nThe pattern follows a simple alternating sequence of shapes and colors. Each row alternates between red circles and blue squares, with the starting shape alternating between rows. Specifically:\n- The first row starts with a red circle, followed by a blue square, then a red circle, and another blue square.\n- The second row starts with a blue square, followed by a red circle, then a blue square, and another red circle.\n- The third row mirrors the first row, starting with a red circle.\n- The fourth row mirrors the second row, starting with a blue square.\n\nPrediction:\nThe next row in the sequence, if we continue the pattern, would be the fifth row, which should mirror the first row. Thus, it will start with a red circle and alternate between red circles and blue squares.\nSo, the fifth row will be: red circle, blue square, red circle, blue square.\n\nAnswer: red circle, blue square, red circle, blue square",

The starting shape and color of each row also alternate. The first row starts with a red circle, the second row starts with a blue square, the third row starts with a red circle, and so forth.\n\nPrediction:\nThe next row in the sequence, following the given pattern, would start with a blue square and alternate with red circles.
