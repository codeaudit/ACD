However, LLMs are designed to handle complex text-based tasks, and recent advancements have shown promising results in similar challenges.\n\n4. **Evaluation Mechanism**:\n   - The task is evaluated using `eval_with_llm_judge`, which ensures that the response is judged based on predefined criteria.
