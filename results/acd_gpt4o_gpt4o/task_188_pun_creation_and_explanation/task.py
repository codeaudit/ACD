Prompt: {t['prompt']}

Ensure that the pun is funny, coherent, and appropriate. The explanation should clearly describe the wordplay and why it is humorous. Provide your response in the following format:

Pun: [Your pun]
Explanation: [Your explanation]

Example:
Prompt: Why did the scarecrow win an award?
Pun: Because he was outstanding in his field.
Explanation: The pun plays on the double meaning of 'outstanding'â€”both as being exceptionally good and literally standing out in a field, which is where scarecrows are placed."""
