However, legal documents present a higher level of complexity due to the necessity of understanding legal jargon and implications accurately.\n\n5. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the summaries. There is some risk that the LLM judge might not fully grasp the nuances of legal language, potentially affecting the reliability of the evaluation.\n\nConsidering these points, the fact that the LLM succeeded at accurately summarizing a legal document, maintaining clarity, conciseness, and capturing key points and implications within the word limit, is quite impressive. This indicates a high level of comprehension and summarization capability, especially given the task's difficulty.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
