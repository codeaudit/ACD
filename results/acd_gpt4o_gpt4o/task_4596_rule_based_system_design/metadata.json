            "1. Rule-based System for a Card Game:\n\n**Objective:** The objective of the game is to be the first player to collect a complete set of cards that meet specific criteria outlined by the rules.\n\n**Setup:** \n- The game uses a deck of cards with four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, each containing cards numbered 1 to 10.\n- The deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt 5 cards to start.\n- The remaining cards form a draw pile, and the top card of the draw pile is placed face-up to start the discard pile.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n**Rule 1: Suit Sequence Rule**\n- Players aim to collect a sequence of three cards in the same suit. A valid sequence can be any three consecutive numbers (e.g., 3, 4, 5 of Hearts).\n- On their turn, a player can draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. They must then discard one card from their hand to the discard pile.\n\n**Rule 2: Special Combos Rule**\n- Players can also win by collecting a special combination of cards, known as a \"Royal Combo,\" which consists of cards numbered 7, 8, and 9 from any suit.\n- If a player forms a Royal Combo, they must declare it immediately, and the game ends with that player as the winner.\n\n**Rule 3: Set of Same Number Rule**\n- Another way to win is by collecting four cards of the same number but from different suits (e.g., 2 of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds, 2 of Clubs, 2 of Spades).\n- Players must show their hand to prove they have all four cards of the same number when they achieve this.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n1. On a player's turn, they can draw one card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.\n2. The player must then discard one card from their hand to maintain a hand of five cards.\n3. Players continue to take turns in this manner, aiming to form either a Suit Sequence, a Royal Combo, or a Set of Same Number.\n4. The first player to form one of these winning combinations and declare it wins the game.\n\n**Winning the Game:**\n- The game ends when a player successfully forms one of the winning combinations (Suit Sequence, Royal Combo, or Set of Same Number) and declares it.\n- If multiple players declare a winning combination in the same round, the player with the highest numerical value in their winning combination is the winner (e.g., a Royal Combo of 7, 8, and 9 of Spades beats a Suit Sequence of 1, 2, and 3 of Hearts).\n\n**Example Turn:**\n- Player A draws a card from the draw pile.\n- Player A now has 6 cards and must discard one.\n- Player A discards a card that is not helpful for forming a winning combination.\n- The next player, Player B, takes their turn by drawing a card from the discard pile or draw pile and discarding a card in turn.\n\nBy following these rules, players engage in strategic decision-making to form winning combinations and achieve victory in the card game.",

            "1. **Grid-based Game Rules:**\n    - A player wins if they connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n    - A cell can be flipped from white to black if at least two of its neighbors are black.\n    - A cell can be flipped from black to white if all of its neighbors are white.\n\n2. **Steps a Player Should Follow to Win the Game:**\n\n    1. **Initial Setup:**\n       - Start with a grid where some cells are black and some are white. The initial configuration can vary, but the goal is to strategically flip cells to achieve four connected black cells.\n\n    2. **Analyzing the Grid:**\n       - Examine the current grid configuration to identify potential opportunities to create a row of four black cells.\n       - Look for clusters of black cells that can potentially be extended into a sequence of four.\n\n    3. **Flipping White Cells to Black:**\n       - Identify white cells that can be flipped to black. A white cell can be flipped if at least two of its neighboring cells (adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are black.\n       - Focus on flipping white cells that are adjacent to existing black cells, aiming to create or extend sequences of black cells.\n\n    4. **Preserving Existing Black Cells:**\n       - Ensure that black cells remain black by preventing all their neighboring cells from turning white. If all neighbors of a black cell turn white, the black cell will flip to white.\n\n    5. **Strategic Planning:**\n       - Plan moves ahead by considering the impact of each flip on the overall grid. Aim to create multiple potential sequences of black cells to increase your chances of connecting four.\n       - Consider both offensive and defensive strategies. While trying to form your own sequence of four black cells, also prevent your opponent from creating theirs.\n\n    6. **Winning the Game:**\n       - Continue flipping white cells to black strategically until you connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n       - Once you achieve this, you win the game.\n\n    7. **Adapt and React:**\n       - Continuously adapt your strategy based on the changes in the grid. React to your opponent\u2019s moves and adjust your approach to maintain an advantage.\n\nBy following these steps and applying strategic thinking, a player can effectively navigate the rules of the grid-based game and work towards winning by connecting four black cells in a row.",
            "To win the game based on the given rules, a player needs to strategically flip cells to form a sequence of four contiguous black cells either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here is a detailed explanation of the steps a player should follow:\n\n1. **Evaluate the Grid:**\n   - Begin by examining the current layout of the grid to identify potential opportunities and threats.\n   - Look for clusters of black cells that can be expanded to form a sequence of four.\n\n2. **Flipping White to Black:**\n   - Identify white cells that have at least two neighboring black cells.\n   - Flip these white cells to black to expand the cluster of black cells.\n\n3. **Preventing Opponent's Moves:**\n   - Observe the opponent's potential moves and identify areas where they might form a sequence of four black cells.\n   - If the opponent has a cluster of three black cells in a row, prioritize flipping a white cell adjacent to this cluster to prevent them from winning.\n\n4. **Flipping Black to White:**\n   - Identify black cells that are surrounded by white cells.\n   - Flip these black cells to white to break the opponent's sequences and reduce their chances of winning.\n\n5. **Strategic Placement:**\n   - Plan your moves to create multiple potential sequences of four black cells.\n   - Focus on creating overlapping sequences where flipping one white cell can contribute to multiple potential wins.\n\n6. **Winning the Game:**\n   - Continue the process of flipping white cells to black and black cells to white, while keeping an eye on forming a sequence of four black cells.\n   - Once you successfully connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, you win the game.\n\nThe key to winning the game lies in balancing offensive moves (flipping white cells to black to create sequences) with defensive moves (flipping black cells to white to disrupt the opponent's sequences). By carefully analyzing the grid and planning your moves, you can outmaneuver your opponent and achieve victory.",
            "To win the grid-based game, the player should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Potential Moves**: Scan the grid to identify white cells that can be flipped to black. According to the rules, a white cell can be flipped to black if at least two of its neighboring cells are black. Neighbors include cells directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2. **Strategize Flips**: Prioritize flipping white cells that will help form a sequence of four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Consider how each flip will influence future moves and the overall strategy.\n\n3. **Execute Flips**: Flip the identified white cells to black cells. Ensure each flip meets the condition that the white cell has at least two black neighbors.\n\n4. **Monitor Black Cell Sequences**: After each flip, check the grid for any sequences of four black cells in a row. If a sequence is formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the player wins the game.\n\n5. **Prevent Reversion**: Be aware of the condition where a black cell can be flipped back to white if all its neighbors are white. Try to maintain at least one black neighbor for each crucial black cell involved in forming the sequence of four.\n\n6. **Continuous Assessment**: Continuously assess the grid after each move to adapt the strategy based on the changing configuration of black and white cells. \n\nBy following these steps, a player can effectively work towards forming a sequence of four black cells in a row and winning the game.",
            "To win the grid-based game based on the given rules, a player needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start with a grid where cells can be either black or white. The initial configuration may vary, but it's important to identify the current state of the grid.\n\n2. **Understanding the Winning Condition**:\n   - The player wins by connecting four black cells in a row. This can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n3. **Flipping Cells**:\n   - The player can flip a white cell to black if at least two of its neighboring cells are black.\n   - The player can also flip a black cell to white if all of its neighboring cells are white.\n\n4. **Strategic Moves**:\n   - **Identify Potential Flips**: Look for white cells that have at least two black neighbors. These are potential candidates for flipping to black.\n   - **Create Chains**: Focus on creating chains of black cells by flipping strategically placed white cells. Aim to align these chains horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to form a sequence of four.\n   - **Prevent Disconnection**: Be cautious not to flip black cells to white unless it is strategically advantageous. Ensure that you do not isolate black cells, as this could break potential chains.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - **Step-by-Step Flipping**: Start flipping white cells that meet the criteria (at least two black neighbors). Continue this process to gradually build up chains of black cells.\n   - **Defensive Play**: Monitor the grid to ensure that your black cells are not surrounded entirely by white cells, which would allow an opponent or the game rules to flip them back to white.\n\n6. **Iterate and Adapt**:\n   - Continuously evaluate the grid after each move. Adapt your strategy based on the current configuration and any changes resulting from your moves.\n   - Be mindful of potential opportunities and threats, adjusting your strategy to optimize your chances of connecting four black cells in a row.\n\nBy following these steps and strategically flipping cells, a player can effectively work towards winning the game by forming a sequence of four black cells in a row.",
            "To win the grid-based game described in the scenario, a player must connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here are the steps a player should follow to achieve this based on the given rules:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial State:** Begin by observing the initial configuration of the grid, noting the positions of black and white cells.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Moves:**\n    - Look for white cells that have at least two neighboring black cells. These cells are candidates for flipping to black based on Rule 2.\n    - Evaluate each potential move to see how it contributes to forming a line of four consecutive black cells.\n\n3. **Execute Strategic Flips:**\n    - Flip the selected white cells to black in a manner that maximizes the possibility of creating a line of four black cells. Focus on moves that either:\n        a) Extend an existing line of black cells.\n        b) Create new opportunities for forming lines by clustering black cells.\n\n4. **Defensive Consideration:**\n    - Monitor the grid to ensure any black cell clusters are not isolated by white cells. If a black cell is surrounded entirely by white cells, it will flip to white based on Rule 3.\n    - Strategically place black cells in positions that prevent your opponent from easily isolating and flipping them back to white.\n\n5. **Win Condition:**\n    - Continue flipping white cells to black and maintaining existing black cells until you successfully form a line of four consecutive black cells, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\nBy following these steps, a player can strategically maneuver the grid to achieve the winning condition of connecting four black cells in a row."

Rule-based System for a Card Game:\n\n**Objective:** The objective of the game is to be the first player to collect a complete set of cards that meet specific criteria outlined by the rules.\n\n**Setup:** \n- The game uses a deck of cards with four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades, each containing cards numbered 1 to 10.\n- The deck is shuffled, and each player is dealt 5 cards to start.\n- The remaining cards form a draw pile, and the top card of the draw pile is placed face-up to start the discard pile.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n**Rule 1: Suit Sequence Rule**\n- Players aim to collect a sequence of three cards in the same suit. A valid sequence can be any three consecutive numbers (e.g., 3, 4, 5 of Hearts).\n- On their turn, a player can draw a card from either the draw pile or the discard pile. They must then discard one card from their hand to the discard pile.\n\n**Rule 2: Special Combos Rule**\n- Players can also win by collecting a special combination of cards, known as a \"Royal Combo,\" which consists of cards numbered 7, 8, and 9 from any suit.\n- If a player forms a Royal Combo, they must declare it immediately, and the game ends with that player as the winner.\n\n**Rule 3: Set of Same Number Rule**\n- Another way to win is by collecting four cards of the same number but from different suits (e.g., 2 of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds, 2 of Clubs, 2 of Spades).\n- Players must show their hand to prove they have all four cards of the same number when they achieve this.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n1. On a player's turn, they can draw one card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.\n2. The player must then discard one card from their hand to maintain a hand of five cards.\n3. Players continue to take turns in this manner, aiming to form either a Suit Sequence, a Royal Combo, or a Set of Same Number.\n4. The first player to form one of these winning combinations and declare it wins the game.\n\n**Winning the Game:**\n- The game ends when a player successfully forms one of the winning combinations (Suit Sequence, Royal Combo, or Set of Same Number) and declares it.\n- If multiple players declare a winning combination in the same round, the player with the highest numerical value in their winning combination is the winner (e.g., a Royal Combo of 7, 8, and 9 of Spades beats a Suit Sequence of 1, 2, and 3 of Hearts).\n\n**Example Turn:**\n- Player A draws a card from the draw pile.\n- Player A now has 6 cards and must discard one.\n- Player A discards a card that is not helpful for forming a winning combination.\n- The next player, Player B, takes their turn by drawing a card from the discard pile or draw pile and discarding a card in turn.\n\nBy following these rules, players engage in strategic decision-making to form winning combinations and achieve victory in the card game.",

Draw one card from either the draw pile or the discard pile.\n     2. Play one card to the table (if it meets a rule condition) or discard one card to the discard pile.\n\n7. **Winning Conditions:**\n   - The first player to successfully meet one of the following three conditions and shout \"Suit Master!\" wins the game.\n\n8. **Rules:**\n   - **Rule 1: Sequential Run**\n     - A player wins by collecting a sequential run of 5 cards in the same suit. For example: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of Hearts.\n   \n   - **Rule 2: Same Number Set**\n     - A player wins by collecting 4 cards of the same number, one from each suit. For example: 5 of Hearts, 5 of Diamonds, 5 of Clubs, 5 of Spades.\n   \n   - **Rule 3: Full House**\n     - A player wins by collecting a set of 3 cards of the same number and a set of 2 cards of the same number, all from different suits. For example: 7 of Hearts, 7 of Diamonds, 7 of Clubs, and 2 of Spades, 2 of Diamonds.\n\n9. **Additional Rules:**\n   - If the draw pile is depleted, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.\n   - Players can only hold a maximum of 7 cards in their hand at any time.\n   - If a player accidentally draws more cards or discards in error, they lose their next turn as a penalty.\n\n**Example of Gameplay:**\n- Player A has 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of Hearts on the table and draws the 8 of Hearts.

            "1. **Grid-based Game Rules:**\n    - A player wins if they connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n    - A cell can be flipped from white to black if at least two of its neighbors are black.\n    - A cell can be flipped from black to white if all of its neighbors are white.\n\n2. **Steps a Player Should Follow to Win the Game:**\n\n    1. **Initial Setup:**\n       - Start with a grid where some cells are black and some are white. The initial configuration can vary, but the goal is to strategically flip cells to achieve four connected black cells.\n\n    2. **Analyzing the Grid:**\n       - Examine the current grid configuration to identify potential opportunities to create a row of four black cells.\n       - Look for clusters of black cells that can potentially be extended into a sequence of four.\n\n    3. **Flipping White Cells to Black:**\n       - Identify white cells that can be flipped to black. A white cell can be flipped if at least two of its neighboring cells (adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) are black.\n       - Focus on flipping white cells that are adjacent to existing black cells, aiming to create or extend sequences of black cells.\n\n    4. **Preserving Existing Black Cells:**\n       - Ensure that black cells remain black by preventing all their neighboring cells from turning white. If all neighbors of a black cell turn white, the black cell will flip to white.\n\n    5. **Strategic Planning:**\n       - Plan moves ahead by considering the impact of each flip on the overall grid. Aim to create multiple potential sequences of black cells to increase your chances of connecting four.\n       - Consider both offensive and defensive strategies. While trying to form your own sequence of four black cells, also prevent your opponent from creating theirs.\n\n    6. **Winning the Game:**\n       - Continue flipping white cells to black strategically until you connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n       - Once you achieve this, you win the game.\n\n    7. **Adapt and React:**\n       - Continuously adapt your strategy based on the changes in the grid. React to your opponent\u2019s moves and adjust your approach to maintain an advantage.\n\nBy following these steps and applying strategic thinking, a player can effectively navigate the rules of the grid-based game and work towards winning by connecting four black cells in a row.",
            "Answer: \nTo win the game based on the given rules, a player needs to strategically flip cells to form a sequence of four contiguous black cells either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here is a detailed explanation of the steps a player should follow:\n\n1. **Evaluate the Grid:**\n   - Begin by examining the current layout of the grid to identify potential opportunities and threats.\n   - Look for clusters of black cells that can be expanded to form a sequence of four.\n\n2. **Flipping White to Black:**\n   - Identify white cells that have at least two neighboring black cells.\n   - Flip these white cells to black to expand the cluster of black cells.\n\n3. **Preventing Opponent's Moves:**\n   - Observe the opponent's potential moves and identify areas where they might form a sequence of four black cells.\n   - If the opponent has a cluster of three black cells in a row, prioritize flipping a white cell adjacent to this cluster to prevent them from winning.\n\n4. **Flipping Black to White:**\n   - Identify black cells that are surrounded by white cells.\n   - Flip these black cells to white to break the opponent's sequences and reduce their chances of winning.\n\n5. **Strategic Placement:**\n   - Plan your moves to create multiple potential sequences of four black cells.\n   - Focus on creating overlapping sequences where flipping one white cell can contribute to multiple potential wins.\n\n6. **Winning the Game:**\n   - Continue the process of flipping white cells to black and black cells to white, while keeping an eye on forming a sequence of four black cells.\n   - Once you successfully connect four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, you win the game.\n\nThe key to winning the game lies in balancing offensive moves (flipping white cells to black to create sequences) with defensive moves (flipping black cells to white to disrupt the opponent's sequences). By carefully analyzing the grid and planning your moves, you can outmaneuver your opponent and achieve victory.",
            "1. For interpreting a grid-based game: Describe the steps a player should follow to win the game based on the given rules.\n\nAnswer: \n\nTo win the grid-based game, the player should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Potential Moves**: Scan the grid to identify white cells that can be flipped to black. According to the rules, a white cell can be flipped to black if at least two of its neighboring cells are black. Neighbors include cells directly adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2. **Strategize Flips**: Prioritize flipping white cells that will help form a sequence of four black cells in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Consider how each flip will influence future moves and the overall strategy.\n\n3. **Execute Flips**: Flip the identified white cells to black cells. Ensure each flip meets the condition that the white cell has at least two black neighbors.\n\n4. **Monitor Black Cell Sequences**: After each flip, check the grid for any sequences of four black cells in a row. If a sequence is formed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the player wins the game.\n\n5. **Prevent Reversion**: Be aware of the condition where a black cell can be flipped back to white if all its neighbors are white. Try to maintain at least one black neighbor for each crucial black cell involved in forming the sequence of four.\n\n6. **Continuous Assessment**: Continuously assess the grid after each move to adapt the strategy based on the changing configuration of black and white cells. \n\nBy following these steps, a player can effectively work towards forming a sequence of four black cells in a row and winning the game.",
            "Answer: \n\nTo win the grid-based game based on the given rules, a player needs to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - Start with a grid where cells can be either black or white. The initial configuration may vary, but it's important to identify the current state of the grid.\n\n2. **Understanding the Winning Condition**:\n   - The player wins by connecting four black cells in a row. This can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n3. **Flipping Cells**:\n   - The player can flip a white cell to black if at least two of its neighboring cells are black.\n   - The player can also flip a black cell to white if all of its neighboring cells are white.\n\n4. **Strategic Moves**:\n   - **Identify Potential Flips**: Look for white cells that have at least two black neighbors. These are potential candidates for flipping to black.\n   - **Create Chains**: Focus on creating chains of black cells by flipping strategically placed white cells. Aim to align these chains horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to form a sequence of four.\n   - **Prevent Disconnection**: Be cautious not to flip black cells to white unless it is strategically advantageous. Ensure that you do not isolate black cells, as this could break potential chains.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - **Step-by-Step Flipping**: Start flipping white cells that meet the criteria (at least two black neighbors). Continue this process to gradually build up chains of black cells.\n   - **Defensive Play**: Monitor the grid to ensure that your black cells are not surrounded entirely by white cells, which would allow an opponent or the game rules to flip them back to white.\n\n6. **Iterate and Adapt**:\n   - Continuously evaluate the grid after each move. Adapt your strategy based on the current configuration and any changes resulting from your moves.\n   - Be mindful of potential opportunities and threats, adjusting your strategy to optimize your chances of connecting four black cells in a row.\n\nBy following these steps and strategically flipping cells, a player can effectively work towards winning the game by forming a sequence of four black cells in a row.",
