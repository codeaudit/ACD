We can consider your request. However, a salary of $60,000 is above our initial budget. Could we possibly discuss a middle ground?\n\nYou: I understand budget constraints. Considering the value I would bring to the team, how about a salary of $55,000 per year, along with the two weeks of vacation and remote work option?\n\nEmployer: We appreciate your flexibility. We can agree to the two weeks of vacation and the remote work option. However, the salary is still a bit high.
