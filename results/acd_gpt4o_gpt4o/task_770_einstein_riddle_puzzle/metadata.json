The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.\n   - Therefore, the second house is blue.\n\n3. The man living in the center house drinks milk.\n   - Therefore, the third house has milk as a drink.\n\n4. The Brit lives in the red house.\n   - The red house cannot be the first or second house since the Norwegian is in the first house and the second house is blue. It also cannot be the third house because the drink there is milk, and we don't know what the Brit drinks yet. So, the red house is either the fourth or fifth house.\n\n5. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.\n   - The green house can only be in positions 3 or 4 to have the white house immediately to its right.\n\n6. The owner of the green house drinks coffee.\n   - If the green house is in position 4, the white house must be in position 5. Thus, the owner of the green house drinks coffee.\n\n7. The Brit lives in the red house.\n   - Therefore, the red house must be the fourth house, and the green house must be the third house (since it\u2019s immediately to the left of the white house in the fifth position).

The Norwegian lives in the first house.\n2. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house, so the second house is blue.\n3. The man living in the center house drinks milk, so the third house has milk.\n4. The green house is immediately to the left of the white house.\n5. The owner of the green house drinks coffee.\n\nSince the Norwegian is in the first house, and the second house is blue, only the third, fourth, and fifth houses can be green and white. Thus, the fourth house must be green and the fifth house must be white (so green is immediately to the left of white).\n\n6. The Brit lives in the red house.\n7. Since the fourth house is green (and the fifth house is white), the Brit must live in either the first, second, or third house. But the first house is occupied by the Norwegian, and the second house is blue. Therefore, the Brit lives in the third house, which is red.\n\n8. The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. The only house left that can be yellow is the first house.\n9. The man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. Since the first house is yellow and smokes Dunhill, the second house (blue) must have horses.\n\nNext, we use the remaining clues to place the remaining nationalities, drinks, pets, and cigarettes.\n\n10. The green house drinks coffee. Therefore, the fourth house drinks coffee.\n11. The Dane drinks tea. Therefore, the only house left for the Dane is the second house, which drinks tea.\n12. The German smokes Prince. Therefore, the only house left for the German is the fourth house.\n13. The Swede keeps dogs. Therefore, the only house left for the Swede is the fifth house, which keeps dogs.\n14. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. Since the Brit lives in the third house, and the only house left for birds is the third house, the Brit must rear birds and smoke Pall Mall.\n15. The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer. Therefore, the only house left is the fifth house, which drinks beer and smokes Blue Master.\n16. The man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. Since the first house is yellow and smokes Dunhill, the second house (blue) must have horses, leaving cats to be kept by the fifth house.\n17. The man who smokes blends has a neighbor who drinks water. Therefore, the only house left for blends is the second house, which drinks tea. The only drink left for the first house is water.\n\nSo:\n\n- 1st house: Norwegian, yellow, water, Dunhill, ?\n- 2nd house: Dane, blue, tea, blends, horses\n- 3rd house: Brit, red, milk, Pall Mall, birds\n- 4th house: German, green, coffee, Prince, ?\n- 5th house: Swede, white, beer, Blue Master, dogs\n\nThe only pet left for the Norwegian is fish.\n\nAnswer: \nWater: Norwegian\nZebra/Fish: German",

Therefore, the green house must be the fourth house and the white house must be the fifth house.\n\n5. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 1: House colors and nationalities:\n     - Norwegian: House 1 (unknown color yet)\n     - Blue House: House 2\n     - Milk: House 3 (unknown color yet)\n     - Green House: House 4 (drinks coffee)\n     - White House: House 5\n\n6. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 9: The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.\n   \n   Therefore, the yellow house must be the first house because it is the only house left without a color.\n\nSo far:\n   - House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, ?, ?, Dunhill\n   - House 2: Blue, ?, ?, ?, ?\n   - House 3: ?, ?, ?, Milk, ?\n   - House 4: Green, ?, ?, Coffee, ?\n   - House 5: White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\n7. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 13: The man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.\n   \n   Therefore, the second house must have a person who keeps horses.\n\nSo far:\n   - House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, ?, ?, Dunhill\n   - House 2: Blue, ?, Horses, ?, ?\n   - House 3: ?, ?, ?, Milk, ?\n   - House 4: Green, ?, ?, Coffee, ?\n   - House 5: White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\n8. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 5: The Dane drinks tea.\n   \n   The Dane must be in the second or fifth house as all other drinks are already taken.\n\n9. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 17: The man who smokes blends has a neighbor who drinks water.\n   \n   Thus, the man who drinks water must be in house 1 or house 5.\n\n10. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 2: Each person has a different pet, drink, cigarette.\n   - Clue 4: The Swede keeps dogs as pets.\n   - Clue 8: The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.\n   - Clue 15: The German smokes Prince.\n\n   Considering all clues and already known facts, we can deduce:\n\n   - House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, ?, Water, Dunhill\n   - House 2: Blue, Dane, Horses, Tea, ?\n   - House 3: Red, Brit, ?, Milk, Pall Mall\n   - House 4: Green, German, ?, Coffee, Prince\n   - House 5: White, Swede, Dogs, ?, Blue Master\n\n11. **Clue Analysis:**\n   - Clue 12: The man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.\n   \n   This means house 2 (Dane, Tea, Horses) smokes blends, and house 1 (Norwegian) or house 3 (Brit) keeps cats.\n\nAfter final deductions:\n\n- House 1: Yellow, Norwegian, Cats, Water, Dunhill\n- House 2: Blue, Dane, Horses, Tea, Blends\n- House 3: Red, Brit, Birds, Milk, Pall Mall\n- House 4: Green, German, Fish, Coffee, Prince\n- House 5: White, Swede, Dogs, Beer, Blue Master\n\nAnswer: Water: Norwegian\nZebra/Fish: German",
            "To solve the puzzle, we need to systematically use the given clues to fill in the details for each house. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **House Positions and Colors:**\n   - The Norwegian lives in the first house. (Clue 11)\n   - The man living in the center house drinks milk. (Clue 10)\n   - The green house is immediately to the left of the white house. (Clue 6)\n   - The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. (Clue 16)\n\nThus, the houses should look like this:\n1. Norwegian, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\n2. ?, Blue, ?, ?, ?, ?\n3. ?, ?, ?, Milk, ?, ?\n4. ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\n5. ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\nSince the Norwegian lives in the first house and next to the blue house, the second house must be blue.\n\n2. **House Colors:**\n   - The green house is immediately to the left of the white house, and the green house owner drinks coffee. (Clues 6 and 7)\n\nWe know the center house (3) drinks milk, so it cannot be green or white. Therefore, the green and white houses must be in positions 4 and 5:\n1. Norwegian, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\n2. ?, Blue, ?, ?, ?, ?\n3. ?, ?, ?, Milk, ?, ?\n4. ?, Green, ?, Coffee, ?, ?\n5. ?, White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\n3. **Nationality and Houses:**\n   - The Brit lives in the red house. (Clue 3)\n\nSince positions 4 and 5 are green and white, the Brit must live in house 3 or 1:\n1. Norwegian, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\n2. ?, Blue, ?, ?, ?, ?\n3. Brit, ?, Red, Milk, ?, ?\n4. ?, Green, ?, Coffee, ?, ?\n5. ?, White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\nSince the Norwegian is in house 1, the Brit must be in house 3 (Red):\n1. Norwegian, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\n2. ?, Blue, ?, ?, ?, ?\n3. Brit, ?, Red, Milk, ?, ?\n4. ?, Green, ?, Coffee, ?, ?\n5. ?, White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\n4. **Cigarettes and Drinks:**\n   - The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. (Clue 9)\n\nThe yellow house must be house 1 (since that is the only open color):\n1. Norwegian, ?, Yellow, ?, Dunhill, ?\n2. ?, Blue, ?, ?, ?, ?\n3. Brit, ?, Red, Milk, ?, ?\n4. ?, Green, ?, Coffee, ?, ?\n5. ?, White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\n5. **Pets and Drinks:**\n   - The Dane drinks tea. (Clue 5)\n   - The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer. (Clue 14)\n   - The man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. (Clue 12)\n   - The man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. (Clue 13)\n\nSince the Norwegian's house is yellow and smokes Dunhill, horses must be in house 2:\n1. Norwegian, ?, Yellow, ?, Dunhill, ?\n2. ?, Blue, ?, ?, ?, Horses\n3. Brit, ?, Red, Milk, ?, ?\n4. ?, Green, ?, Coffee, ?, ?\n5. ?, White, ?, ?, ?, ?\n\n6. **Nationality and Houses:**\n   - The German smokes Prince. (Clue 15)\n   - The Swede keeps dogs. (Clue 4)\n\nAlso, the man who smokes blends has a neighbor who drinks water (Clue 17).\n\nSince the Dane drinks tea, he cannot be in houses 3, 4, or 5:\n1. Norwegian, ?, Yellow, ?, Dunhill, ?\n2. Dane, Blue, ?, Tea, ?, Horses\n3. Brit, ?, Red, Milk, ?, Birds (Pall Mall)\n4. German, Green, ?, Coffee, Prince, ?\n5. Swede, White, ?, ?, ?, Dogs\n\nTherefore:\n- The German smokes Prince and drinks coffee in house 4.\n- The Brit drinks milk and has birds in house 3.\n\nFinally:\n1. Norwegian, ?, Yellow, Water, Dunhill, ?\n2. Dane, Blue, ?, Tea, ?, Horses\n3. Brit, ?, Red, Milk, Pall Mall, Birds\n4. German, Green, ?, Coffee, Prince, Fish\n5. Swede, White, ?, ?, Blue Master, Dogs\n\nThis allows us to know:\nWater: Norwegian\nFish: German\n\nAnswer: \nWater: Norwegian\nZebra/Fish: German"

However, their performance can vary significantly depending on the complexity and the specific nature of the task.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method:** The reliance on the `eval_with_llm_judge` function for scoring adds another layer of complexity. This method is susceptible to issues such as ambiguity in natural language evaluation and potential biases of the LLM judge itself.\n\nConsidering these points, if the LLM agent succeeded at solving the \"einstein_riddle_puzzle\" given its high difficulty and the requirement for precise logical deductions, this would indeed be noteworthy.
