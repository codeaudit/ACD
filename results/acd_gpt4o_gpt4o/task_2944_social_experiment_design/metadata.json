Experimental Design: The experiment will involve inducing a good mood in half of the participants by showing them a humorous video or giving them a small treat, while the other half will remain in a neutral mood. In a busy hallway, an actor will drop a stack of books, and observers will record whether participants help pick them up. The likelihood of helping behavior will be compared between the good mood and neutral mood groups.\n2. Ethical Considerations: Informed consent will be obtained retroactively through a debriefing process. The potential harm is minimal, but participants will be given support and the option to withdraw their data if they feel uncomfortable.

Dependent Variable: The likelihood of bystanders helping the person who drops their books. Control: A neutral mood group where no mood-inducing stimuli are presented. Methodology: 1. Recruit participants unaware of the true nature of the experiment. 2. Randomly divide participants into two groups: one group will receive a mood-boosting stimulus (such as a short, funny video or a small gift), and the other group will not receive any mood-inducing stimulus (control group). 3. Have a confederate (an experimenter posing as a regular person) drop their books in a busy hallway where members of both groups are present. 4. Observe and record the number of people from each group who help the confederate pick up the books. 5. Ensure that the observer is unobtrusive to avoid influencing the participants' behavior. 6. Measure outcomes by comparing the helping behavior (number of helpers) between the good mood group and the control group.\n\n2. Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent: Participants should be informed that they are part of a study, but the specific details of the hypothesis and the staged book-dropping incident should be withheld until after the experiment to prevent bias. Obtain consent for the general participation in a behavioral study. Potential Harm: Ensure that the mood induction methods are harmless and that the confederate dropping books does not cause any distress or danger to the participants. For example, using a short, funny video is a low-risk way to induce a good mood. Debriefing: After the experiment, fully debrief participants, explaining the true nature and purpose of the study, the hypothesis being tested, and why certain details were not disclosed upfront. Make sure they understand the importance of their participation and address any questions or concerns they may have.

The other half will proceed without any intervention to serve as the neutral mood group.\n  - **Scenario Setup**: An actor will walk through the hallway and intentionally drop a stack of books in front of the participants.\n  - **Measurement**: Observers will record whether the participants help the person pick up the books. Helping behavior will be defined as any action taken to assist the person within a specified time frame (e.g., 30 seconds).\n  - **Data Analysis**: Compare the proportion of participants who help in the good mood group versus the neutral mood group to test the hypothesis.\n\n2. Ethical Considerations:\n- **Informed Consent**: Since the experiment involves observing natural behavior in a public setting, obtaining explicit informed consent from participants beforehand could influence their behavior and compromise the study. Instead, a debriefing process will be used after the observation to inform participants about the nature of the study and obtain retroactive consent.\n- **Potential Harm**: The risk of harm is minimal as the study involves observing a common social interaction without any physical or psychological stress. However, participants who may feel deceived or uncomfortable upon learning about the experiment will be provided with appropriate support and the option to withdraw their data from the study.\n- **Debriefing**: After the observations are complete, participants will be approached and informed about the experiment's purpose. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions and express any concerns. Participants will also be assured that their behavior was entirely natural and that their participation is confidential.\n\nAnswer: \n1.

In a busy hallway, an actor will drop a stack of books, and observers will record whether participants help pick them up. The likelihood of helping behavior will be compared between the good mood and neutral mood groups.\n2. Ethical Considerations: Informed consent will be obtained retroactively through a debriefing process. The potential harm is minimal, but participants will be given support and the option to withdraw their data if they feel uncomfortable.

Ethical Considerations: \n- **Informed Consent**: Ensure all participants provide informed consent, understanding the purpose of the study, what it entails, and their right to withdraw at any time without penalty.\n- **Privacy**: Respect the privacy of the participants by anonymizing data and ensuring that video recordings are securely stored and only used for the purpose of this experiment.\n- **Potential Harm**: Address any potential discomfort from being observed or recorded. Clearly communicate that the study aims to understand social behaviors and has no judgmental intent.\n- **Debriefing**: After the experiment, debrief participants about the study\u2019s aims, hypotheses, and findings. Address any concerns they might have and ensure they leave the study without any negative feelings.\n- **Voluntariness**: Participation should be entirely voluntary, and participants should feel no coercion or pressure to behave a certain way during the experiment.",
            "Answer: \n1. Experimental Design: \n   - Independent Variable: The use of social media on phones.\n   - Dependent Variable: The amount of face-to-face interaction (measured in minutes and the number of conversational exchanges).\n   - Controls: The type of social gathering (a cafe setting), the time of day, and the duration of the experiment. Ensure all participants are from similar age groups and social backgrounds to minimize variability.\n   - Methodology: \n     a. Recruit a group of friends (10-12 participants) and divide them randomly into two groups: Group A (allowed to use their phones) and Group B (not allowed to use their phones).\n     b. Conduct the experiment in a cafe setting for a duration of 1 hour.\n     c. Use unobtrusive observation to record the amount of face-to-face interaction, noting the number of verbal exchanges and the time spent in conversation.\n     d. Use video recordings (with participants' consent) to accurately measure and later analyze the interactions.\n     e. After the hour, administer a short survey to gather qualitative data on participants' perceptions of their social experience.\n\n2. Ethical Considerations:\n   - Informed Consent: Ensure all participants are fully informed about the nature of the experiment and agree to be observed and recorded. Provide detailed information about the study's purpose, methods, and any potential risks.\n   - Potential Harm: Minimize any discomfort or negative feelings by reassuring participants that their social media usage is not being judged and that the study aims to understand social behaviors. Ensure participants know they can withdraw at any point without any repercussions.\n   - Privacy: Protect the privacy of participants by anonymizing data and securely storing any recordings. Only researchers directly involved in the study should have access to the data.\n   - Debriefing: Conduct a debriefing session after the experiment to explain the findings and purpose further, address any questions, and provide support if any participants feel uncomfortable about their participation. \n\nBy ensuring these ethical guidelines are followed, the study can be conducted responsibly and respectfully."

            "content": "Given the task family and the capabilities of LLMs, I will reason through the factors involved:\n\n1. **Creativity and Logical Reasoning**: LLMs have been shown to generate coherent and creative responses to prompts. Designing an experimental setup may not be beyond the capabilities of a well-trained LLM, especially with clear instructions.\n\n2. **Social Understanding**: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, including social interactions and norms. They should be able to understand scenarios like helping behavior in a busy hallway.\n\n3. **Ethical Reasoning**: While LLMs can generate text that appears to consider ethical implications, this is often based on pattern recognition from the training data. Ethical reasoning can be complex and context-dependent, but LLMs can provide surface-level considerations that appear reasonable.\n\n4. **Difficulty Level**: Designing a social experiment with detailed controls and ethical considerations is indeed difficult for most humans due to the nuanced understanding required. However, LLMs can draw on their training data to provide structured responses that mimic this understanding.\n\nConsidering the task's implementation:\n- The `get_instructions` method provides clear and structured instructions.\n- The `score` method relies on `eval_with_llm_judge`, which evaluates based on criteria that the LLM can likely address (logical design and ethical considerations).\n\nSince the LLM succeeded at the task, it indicates that it managed to generate a coherent experimental design and address ethical considerations to an acceptable degree.\n\n**Decision: No**"
