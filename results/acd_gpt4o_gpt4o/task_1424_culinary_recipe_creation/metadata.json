            "Recipe: \n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. Season both sides of the chicken breast with salt and pepper.\n3. In a small bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the juice of one lemon, 2 minced garlic cloves, and 1 teaspoon of chopped fresh rosemary.\n4. Place the seasoned chicken breasts in a baking dish and pour the olive oil mixture over them, ensuring they are well-coated.\n5. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\n6. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute.\n\nInterpretation:\n1. Preheating the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) ensures that it is at the right temperature when you place the chicken inside, allowing for even cooking and ensuring the dish can be prepared within the 30-minute time constraint.\n2. Seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper enhances the flavor of the meat. Salt helps to bring out the natural flavors, while pepper adds a slight heat and complexity.\n3. Mixing olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and rosemary creates a flavorful marinade that also helps to keep the chicken moist during cooking. Olive oil adds richness, lemon juice provides acidity to balance the flavors, garlic infuses a savory depth, and rosemary adds an aromatic, slightly piney flavor.\n4. Coating the chicken with the marinade ensures that the flavors penetrate the meat and keeps it from drying out while baking. This step also ensures the chicken is evenly flavored.\n5. Baking the chicken at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 20-25 minutes cooks the chicken through while keeping it moist. The relatively high temperature helps to achieve a nice, slightly browned exterior without overcooking the interior.\n6. Letting the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving is crucial. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a more tender and juicy final dish.",
            "Recipe: \nGrilled Lemon Garlic Rosemary Chicken\n\nIngredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n- 1 lemon (zest and juice)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.\n2. In a small bowl, combine the minced garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, and rosemary. Mix well to create the marinade.\n3. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.\n4. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well coated. Let it marinate for 10 minutes.\n5. Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off.\n6. Grill the chicken breasts for 6-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C).\n7. Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.\n\nInterpretation:\n1. Preheating the grill ensures that the chicken will cook evenly and develop a nice sear, which enhances flavor and texture.\n2. The marinade is crucial as it imparts the flavors of garlic, lemon, and rosemary into the chicken. The olive oil helps to distribute these flavors and also aids in the grilling process by preventing the chicken from sticking to the grill.\n3. Seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper enhances its natural flavors and ensures the dish is well-seasoned throughout.\n4. Marinating the chicken for 10 minutes allows the flavors to penetrate the meat slightly. This short marinating time is sufficient for a quick recipe and ensures that the dish remains under 30 minutes.\n5. Removing excess marinade prevents flare-ups on the grill and ensures that the chicken grills properly rather than steaming.\n6. Grilling the chicken breasts for the appropriate time ensures they are fully cooked, safe to eat, and still juicy. An internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C) is the safe threshold for chicken.\n7. Resting the chicken allows the juices to redistribute within the meat, making it more tender and flavorful. This step is crucial for achieving the best texture and juiciness in the final dish.\n\nThis recipe is low-carb as it contains no high-carb ingredients and focuses on lean protein and healthy fats from the olive oil. The use of fresh herbs and citrus adds vibrant flavors without the need for additional carbohydrates.",

            "Recipe: \n\n**Stir-Fried Tofu and Broccoli with Ginger-Soy Sauce**\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 block of firm tofu, drained and cubed\n- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely grated\n- 2 cups broccoli florets\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for frying)\n- Optional: sesame seeds for garnish\n\nInstructions:\n1. Begin by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top for about 15 minutes.\n2. While the tofu is being pressed, prepare the sauce by combining soy sauce, sesame oil, and grated ginger in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.\n3. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the tofu cubes and stir-fry until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove tofu from the skillet and set aside.\n4. In the same skillet, add the broccoli florets and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until they are bright green and slightly tender but still crisp.\n5. Return the tofu to the skillet with the broccoli. Pour the ginger-soy sauce over the tofu and broccoli, stirring well to ensure even coating. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n6. Remove from heat and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish with sesame seeds if desired. Serve immediately.\n\nInterpretation:\n\n1. **Pressing the tofu**: This step is crucial to remove excess moisture from the tofu, allowing it to crisp up better when fried. It helps in achieving a firmer texture that can hold up well during cooking and absorb flavors more effectively.\n   \n2. **Preparing the sauce**: Combining soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger creates a simple yet flavorful sauce that is integral to the dish. Soy sauce provides a salty umami flavor, sesame oil adds a nutty aroma, and fresh ginger gives a zesty, slightly spicy kick. Mixing these ingredients beforehand ensures that the flavors are well-integrated and ready to be quickly added during the stir-frying process.\n\n3. **Stir-frying the tofu**: Cooking the tofu until golden brown and crispy adds a satisfying texture contrast to the dish. It ensures that the tofu is not only flavorful but also has a pleasant bite, making the dish more enjoyable to eat.\n\n4. **Stir-frying the broccoli**: Cooking the broccoli until it is bright green and slightly tender ensures that it retains its vibrant color and nutritional value while still providing a crunchy texture. Overcooking the broccoli would result in a mushy texture and a loss of nutrients.\n\n5. **Combining tofu, broccoli, and sauce**: Returning the tofu to the skillet and adding the sauce allows all the ingredients to be evenly coated with the flavorful sauce. This step ensures that the tofu and broccoli are well-seasoned and that the dish has a cohesive flavor profile.\n\n6. **Garnishing and serving**: Adding sesame seeds as a garnish is optional but it can enhance the dish with a subtle crunch and a hint of nuttiness. Serving the dish immediately ensures that the tofu remains crispy and the broccoli retains its desired texture.",
