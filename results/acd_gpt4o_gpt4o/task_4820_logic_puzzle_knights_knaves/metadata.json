In the first scenario (A is a knight, B is a knave, C is a knight):\n   - A (knight) says \"I am a knight\": True.\n   - B (knave) says \"A is a knave\": False (because A is a knight).\n   - C (knight) says \"A is a knight\": True.\n   This scenario is consistent.\n\n2.

This scenario is consistent.\n\nIf A is a knave, B (knight) says A is a knave (which is true), and C (knave) says A is a knight (which is false). This scenario is also consistent.\n\nThus, the puzzle allows for two consistent solutions. However, typically, logic puzzles of this nature have a unique solution.

However, LLMs have shown proficiency in handling logical puzzles to some extent.\n\n2. **Task Example**: The example provided (A says, \"We are both knaves.\" B says nothing) is a classic knights and knaves puzzle. The correct reasoning would be:\n   - If A were telling the truth (a knight), then \"We are both knaves\" would be a contradiction, thus A cannot be a knight.\n   - Therefore, A must be lying (a knave).\n   - Since knaves always lie, A's statement \"We are both knaves\" is false, meaning at least one of them (A or B) is not a knave.\n   - Since A is a knave, B must be a knight.\n\n   The solution would be:\n   ```\n   A: knave\n   B: knight\n   ```\n\n3. **LLM Judging**: The solution is evaluated using an LLM judge, which checks for logical consistency and correctness.
