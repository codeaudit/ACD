Compare the rate data for different concentrations:\n   - When the concentration is doubled from 0.1 M to 0.2 M, the rate increases from 0.01 M/s to 0.04 M/s.\n   - When the concentration is tripled from 0.1 M to 0.3 M, the rate increases from 0.01 M/s to 0.09 M/s.\n   - When the concentration is quadrupled from 0.1 M to 0.4 M, the rate increases from 0.01 M/s to 0.16 M/s.\n   - When the concentration is quintupled from 0.1 M to 0.5 M, the rate increases from 0.01 M/s to 0.25 M/s.\n\n2.
