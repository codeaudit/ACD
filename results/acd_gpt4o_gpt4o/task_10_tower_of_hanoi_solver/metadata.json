The scoring method checks not only the validity of the moves but also whether the sequence is optimal. This thorough evaluation ensures that the solution isn't just correct but also efficient.\n\nGiven these considerations, while solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle demonstrates the LLM's advanced capabilities in logical reasoning and procedural generation, it is not entirely surprising.
