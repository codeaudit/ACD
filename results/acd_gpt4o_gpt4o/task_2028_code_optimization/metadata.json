By using memoization, we store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers in a dictionary (`memo`).

To optimize it, I introduced memoization, which stores the results of the Fibonacci calculations in a dictionary (`memo`). By checking if a Fibonacci number has already been computed before making recursive calls, we avoid redundant calculations, reducing the time complexity to O(n).

The optimized code uses memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci values in a dictionary. This reduces the time complexity to linear O(n) by ensuring that each Fibonacci number is computed only once and reused whenever needed, significantly improving the performance for larger values of `n`.",

To optimize the performance, I implemented memoization. Memoization stores the results of expensive function calls and reuses them when the same inputs occur again.

The `memo` dictionary keeps track of the Fibonacci numbers that have already been computed, thus preventing redundant calculations and significantly improving performance."

This results in unnecessary iterations. By adding an inner `while` loop to continuously divide `n` by `i` while it is divisible, we reduce the number of iterations and make the code more efficient.\n2. **Condition Check Order**: The condition `if n > 1` was moved outside the loop to after the main loop completes. This ensures that any remaining prime factor greater than the square root of the original `n` is captured and appended to the `factors` list.\n3. **Code Readability**: Indentation and formatting were improved to enhance readability, making it easier to understand the flow of the program.",

This makes it check both even and odd factors.\n   - Since 2 is the only even prime, we can handle it separately by continuously dividing `n` by 2 until it is odd. This reduces the number of iterations needed in the main loop.\n\n2. **Check Only Odd Factors:**\n   - After removing all factors of 2, we only need to check for odd factors starting from 3.
