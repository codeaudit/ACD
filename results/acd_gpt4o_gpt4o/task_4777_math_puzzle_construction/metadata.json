For \\(n = 3\\): \\(a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 13 \\Rightarrow 9a + 3b + c = 13\\)\n\nSolving this system of equations, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[ (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 7 - 3 \\Rightarrow 3a + b = 4 \\]\n\nNext, subtract the second equation from the third:\n\\[ (9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 13 - 7 \\Rightarrow 5a + b = 6 \\]\n\nNow, solve the two equations:\n1. \\(3a + b = 4\\)\n2. \\(5a + b = 6\\)\n\nSubtract the first from the second:\n\\[ (5a + b) - (3a + b) = 6 - 4 \\Rightarrow 2a = 2 \\Rightarrow a = 1 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a = 1\\) back into \\(3a + b = 4\\):\n\\[ 3(1) + b = 4 \\Rightarrow 3 + b = 4 \\Rightarrow b = 1 \\]\n\nFinally, substitute \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\) back into \\(a + b + c = 3\\):\n\\[ 1 + 1 + c = 3 \\Rightarrow c = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the quadratic equation is:\n\\[ T_n = n^2 + n + 1 \\]\n\nTo find the next term (\\(T_6\\)):\n\\[ T_6 = 6^2 + 6 + 1 = 36 + 6 + 1 = 43 \\]\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 43.
