Additionally, both could explore studying in different locations, such as a library or a coffee shop, to accommodate their preferences. By compromising and showing empathy towards each other's needs, they can create a study environment that works for both."

They could set up a meeting in a neutral setting, ensuring both are prepared to speak calmly and listen actively. Maria should explain how she feels her contributions have been overlooked, providing specific examples if possible. John should then share his viewpoint, detailing his contributions and why he feels deserving of recognition.\n\nTo reach a resolution, they could propose a collaborative approach where both of their efforts are acknowledged. They could present their work together to their supervisor, highlighting each other's contributions. Additionally, they might create a system for future projects where responsibilities and contributions are documented clearly, preventing misunderstandings.\n\nIf necessary, involving a neutral third party, such as a mediator or HR representative, could help facilitate the discussion and ensure fair acknowledgment.

This requires the model to understand social dynamics, empathy, and conflict resolution.\n2. **Human Difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is moderate, suggesting that while it may not be trivial, it is within the realm of what LLMs have been shown to handle reasonably well.\n3. **Capabilities of LLMs**: Current LLMs, such as GPT-3 and its successors, have demonstrated proficiency in understanding and generating text related to social reasoning and conflict resolution. Given sufficient context and prompt engineering, they can provide thoughtful and balanced responses.\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The task is evaluated by an LLM judge using specified criteria. This automated evaluation is crucial as it leverages the model's ability to self-evaluate based on clear guidelines.\n5. **Success**: The agent succeeded at the task, meaning it was able to generate a resolution that met the criteria of being fair, empathetic, and practical.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM in this task is not overly surprising.
