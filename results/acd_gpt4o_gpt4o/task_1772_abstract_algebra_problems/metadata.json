            "The group of integers under addition, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), is an abelian group.",
            "1. Introduction:\nTo prove that the group of integers under addition, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), is an abelian group, we need to verify that it satisfies the four fundamental properties of a group (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses) as well as the additional property for abelian groups (commutativity).\n\n2. Step-by-step proof or solution:\n- **Closure**: A set is closed under an operation if performing the operation on any two elements of the set results in another element of the set. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, this means that for any integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), their sum \\( a + b \\) must also be an integer. Since the sum of any two integers is always an integer, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is closed under addition.\n\n- **Associativity**: An operation is associative if the grouping of the elements does not affect the result. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, we need to show that for any integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n  \\[\n  (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\n  \\]\n  Since addition of integers is associative, this property is satisfied.\n\n- **Identity Element**: A set has an identity element for an operation if there is an element in the set that, when used in the operation with any other element of the set, leaves the other element unchanged. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, the identity element is 0 because for any integer \\( a \\):\n  \\[\n  a + 0 = 0 + a = a\n  \\]\n  Thus, 0 is the identity element in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition.\n\n- **Inverses**: For each element in the set, there must be another element in the set such that the operation between them results in the identity element. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, the inverse of any integer \\( a \\) is \\( -a \\) because:\n  \\[\n  a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0\n  \\]\n  Therefore, every integer has an inverse in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition.\n\n- **Commutativity**: A group is abelian if the operation is commutative, meaning for any elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n  \\[\n  a + b = b + a\n  \\]\n  Since the addition of integers is commutative, this property holds for \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nWe have shown that \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition satisfies all the properties of a group (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses) and the additional property of commutativity. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is not only a group but an abelian group under addition. \n\nThus, we conclude that the group of integers under addition, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), is an abelian group.",
            "1. Introduction\n\nTo prove that the group of integers under addition, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), is an abelian group, we need to verify that \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) satisfies the four group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses) and the commutativity property. \n\n2. Step-by-step proof or solution\n\n**Closure:**\nFor any two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), their sum \\( a + b \\) is also an integer. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is closed under addition.\n\\[ \\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\; a + b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\]\n\n**Associativity:**\nAddition of integers is associative. For any integers \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\):\n\\[ (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \\]\nThis property holds because it is a basic property of addition in arithmetic.\n\n**Identity Element:**\nThe identity element in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition is 0, because adding 0 to any integer \\( a \\) leaves \\( a \\) unchanged:\n\\[ \\forall a \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\; a + 0 = 0 + a = a \\]\n\n**Inverses:**\nFor every integer \\( a \\), there exists an integer \\( -a \\) such that:\n\\[ a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 \\]\nHere, \\( -a \\) is the additive inverse of \\( a \\).\n\n**Commutativity:**\nTo show that the group is abelian, we must prove that the addition of any two integers is commutative:\n\\[ \\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\; a + b = b + a \\]\nThis holds because commutativity of addition is a fundamental property of integers.\n\n3.

            "1. **Introduction**\n\nWe are asked to prove that the set of integers \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under the operation of addition forms an abelian group. To do this, we need to verify that \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) satisfies the four group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility) and the additional property of commutativity.\n\n2. **Step-by-step proof or solution**\n\n- **Closure:**\n  To show closure, we must prove that the sum of any two integers is also an integer. Let \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). Since the sum \\( a + b \\) is also an integer by the definition of addition in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), closure holds.\n\n- **Associativity:**\n  We must show that addition in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is associative. That is, for any \\( a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), we need to show that \\( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \\). By the definition of addition in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), associativity of addition is a well-known property: \\( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \\).\n\n- **Identity:**\n  We need to identify an element in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) that acts as an identity element under addition. The integer 0 serves this purpose because for any \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), \\( a + 0 = 0 + a = a \\). Hence, 0 is the identity element.\n\n- **Invertibility:**\n  For each element \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), there must be an element \\( b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) such that \\( a + b = b + a = 0 \\). The integer \\( -a \\) serves as the inverse of \\( a \\) because \\( a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 \\).\n\n- **Commutativity:**\n  Finally, we need to prove that addition in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is commutative. That is, for any \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), we need to show \\( a + b = b + a \\). By the definition of addition in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), commutativity of addition is a well-known property: \\( a + b = b + a \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**\n\nWe have verified that \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition satisfies all the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility) and also the commutativity property.

            "Answer: \n1. Introduction:\nTo prove that the group of integers under addition, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), is an abelian group, we need to verify that it satisfies the four fundamental properties of a group (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses) as well as the additional property for abelian groups (commutativity).\n\n2. Step-by-step proof or solution:\n- **Closure**: A set is closed under an operation if performing the operation on any two elements of the set results in another element of the set. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, this means that for any integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), their sum \\( a + b \\) must also be an integer. Since the sum of any two integers is always an integer, \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is closed under addition.\n\n- **Associativity**: An operation is associative if the grouping of the elements does not affect the result. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, we need to show that for any integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n  \\[\n  (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\n  \\]\n  Since addition of integers is associative, this property is satisfied.\n\n- **Identity Element**: A set has an identity element for an operation if there is an element in the set that, when used in the operation with any other element of the set, leaves the other element unchanged. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, the identity element is 0 because for any integer \\( a \\):\n  \\[\n  a + 0 = 0 + a = a\n  \\]\n  Thus, 0 is the identity element in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition.\n\n- **Inverses**: For each element in the set, there must be another element in the set such that the operation between them results in the identity element. For \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition, the inverse of any integer \\( a \\) is \\( -a \\) because:\n  \\[\n  a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0\n  \\]\n  Therefore, every integer has an inverse in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition.\n\n- **Commutativity**: A group is abelian if the operation is commutative, meaning for any elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n  \\[\n  a + b = b + a\n  \\]\n  Since the addition of integers is commutative, this property holds for \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nWe have shown that \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) under addition satisfies all the properties of a group (closure, associativity, identity, and inverses) and the additional property of commutativity.

            "1. **Introduction**\n\nWe aim to show that the set \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) of all \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) invertible matrices with real entries forms a group under matrix multiplication. To prove this, we need to verify that \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) satisfies the four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and the existence of inverses.\n\n2. **Step-by-step proof or solution**\n\n**Step 1: Closure**\n\nTo show closure, we need to demonstrate that the product of any two invertible \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrices is also an invertible \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrix.\n\nLet \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) be two invertible \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrices with real entries. By definition, there exist matrices \\( A^{-1} \\) and \\( B^{-1} \\) such that:\n\\[ A A^{-1} = I \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B B^{-1} = I, \\]\nwhere \\( I \\) is the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) identity matrix.\n\nConsider the product \\( AB \\). We need to show that \\( AB \\) is invertible and find its inverse. Notice that:\n\\[ (AB)(B^{-1}A^{-1}) = A(BB^{-1})A^{-1} = AIA^{-1} = AA^{-1} = I, \\]\nand similarly,\n\\[ (B^{-1}A^{-1})(AB) = B^{-1}(A^{-1}A)B = B^{-1}IB = B^{-1}B = I. \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1} \\), and \\( AB \\) is invertible. Hence, \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) is closed under matrix multiplication.\n\n**Step 2: Associativity**\n\nMatrix multiplication is known to be associative. For any matrices \\( A, B, C \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\),\n\\[ (AB)C = A(BC). \\]\n\nThis property holds for all \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrices, and thus for all invertible \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) matrices.\n\n**Step 3: Identity**\n\nThe identity element in \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) under matrix multiplication is the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) identity matrix \\( I \\), which is:\n\\[ I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\]\n\nFor any matrix \\( A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\),\n\\[ AI = A \\quad \\text{and} \\quad IA = A. \\]\n\nThus, the identity matrix \\( I \\) is the identity element in \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\).\n\n**Step 4: Inverses**\n\nBy definition, every element \\( A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) is invertible. This means there exists a matrix \\( A^{-1} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) such that:\n\\[ AA^{-1} = I \\quad \\text{and} \\quad A^{-1}A = I. \\]\n\nTherefore, every element in \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) has an inverse in \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**\n\nWe have verified that the set \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) of all \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) invertible matrices with real entries satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and the existence of inverses. Hence, \\( GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\) forms a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nAnswer: The set of all \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) invertible matrices with real entries, under matrix multiplication, forms a group."
