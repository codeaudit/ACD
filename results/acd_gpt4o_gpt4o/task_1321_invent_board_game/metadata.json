The player with the most successful colonies and resources at the end of the game wins.\nSetup: \n1. Place the board in the center of the table. The board is divided into a grid of space sectors, with some sectors containing planets.\n2. Each player chooses a color and takes the corresponding set of tokens (representing ships and colonies).\n3. Shuffle the exploration cards and resource cards, then place them face down in separate decks.\n4. Each player starts with 3 resource cards and places one ship token on the starting space of the board.\n5. Place the dice within reach of all players.\nRules: \n1. Players take turns in clockwise order.\n2. On a player's turn, they roll the dice to determine how many spaces they can move their ship.\n3. Players can move their ship in any direction but cannot move through occupied spaces.\n4. If a player lands on a new planet, they draw an exploration card which may present a challenge or reward.\n5. Players collect resources by landing on resource-rich sectors or through exploration cards.\n6. To establish a colony on a planet, a player must have the required resources as indicated on the planet's card.\n7. Players can trade resources with each other during their turn.\n8. Some exploration cards may contain hazards, causing players to lose resources or miss a turn.\n9. Players can only have one colony per planet, and each colony grants points based on the planet's value.\n10. The game incorporates resource management, where players must balance between exploring new areas and securing resources for colony building.\nEnd Condition: The game ends when all planets on the board have been explored and colonies have been established, or when the resource deck is depleted. Players then tally their points from colonies and remaining resources. The player with the highest total points wins the game.",
            "Theme: space exploration\nComponents: board, dice, cards, tokens\nPlayers: 2-4\nConstraints: Incorporate resource management and exploration mechanics.\n\nGame Name: Stellar Quest\n\nObjective: Be the first player to successfully explore and colonize three different planets by managing resources and navigating through space.\n\nSetup:\n1. Place the game board in the center, which consists of a network of planets connected by paths.\n2. Shuffle the Exploration cards and Resource cards, placing them face down in their respective decks.\n3. Each player selects a spaceship token and places it on the starting planet (Earth).\n4. Give each player an initial resource pack: 3 Fuel, 2 Food, 1 Technology token.\n5. Each player rolls the dice to determine the turn order; highest roll goes first.\n6. Place a marker on the resource track for each player, indicating their starting resources.\n\nRules:\n1. On your turn, roll the dice to determine your movement (1-6 spaces).\n2. Move your spaceship token along the paths between planets based on your dice roll.\n3. When you land on a planet, draw an Exploration card and follow its instructions. These cards may have events, resources, or challenges.\n4. Manage your resources carefully. Moving between planets consumes Fuel, and staying on a planet consumes Food. Technology tokens can be used to overcome specific challenges or enhance your spaceship.\n5. You can trade resources with other players when you land on the same planet.\n6. Some planets may have special Resource cards that you can draw to gain additional resources or benefits.\n7. To colonize a planet, you must have the required resources (specified on the board for each planet) and successfully complete any challenges from the Exploration cards.\n8. Once you have colonized a planet, place one of your colonization markers on it.\n9. The game continues with players taking turns, exploring, managing resources, and attempting to colonize planets.\n\nEnd Condition:\nThe game ends when a player successfully colonizes three different planets.

Shuffle the deck of cards and place it face down next to the board.\n3. Distribute 5 tokens to each player, representing their armies.\n4. Distribute 10 coins to each player, representing their starting resources.\n5. Each player selects a color and places one of their tokens on the starting region of the board.\n6. Each player draws 3 cards from the deck.\n7. Place the remaining tokens and coins in a common pool accessible to all players.\n8. Randomly determine the first player.\n\nRules:\n1. **Turns**: Players take turns in clockwise order. On a player's turn, they can perform the following actions in any order:\n   - Move Armies: Move up to 2 tokens to adjacent regions.\n   - Trade: Exchange coins for cards or tokens with other players, fostering diplomacy.\n   - Play Cards: Use cards from their hand to gain advantages, such as additional moves, extra resources, or special abilities.\n   - Conquer: Attempt to conquer a region by spending tokens. The cost to conquer is equal to the number of tokens already in the region plus one.\n\n2. **Diplomacy**: Players can form alliances with each other for mutual benefit. Alliances can be used to share resources, support each other in battles, or coordinate strategies. Alliances are not binding and can be broken at any time.\n\n3. **Resources**: Coins are earned by controlling regions. Each region provides a certain amount of coins at the start of a player's turn. Players can also gain coins through card effects and trades.\n\n4. **Victory Points**: Players earn victory points by controlling regions, completing specific card objectives, and forming successful alliances. Each region controlled at the end of the game is worth 1 victory point, specific card objectives vary, and each unbroken alliance at the end of the game is worth 2 victory points.\n\nEnd Condition:\nThe game ends after a set number of rounds (determined by the number of players: 10 rounds for 3-4 players, 8 rounds for 5-6 players) or when all regions on the board are controlled. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game is declared the winner. In case of a tie, the player with the most coins remaining wins. If still tied, the player with the most cards remaining wins.\n\nAnswer:",
