They are generally proficient at explaining common idiomatic expressions and applying them in context due to their training on large datasets that include varied linguistic usages.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is described as having moderate difficulty for humans, which means it may require some cognitive effort but is not exceedingly complex. This level of difficulty suggests that a well-trained LLM should be capable of performing adequately.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The use of an LLM judge, as implemented in the `eval_with_llm_judge` function, to score the response is appropriate given the nature of the task. The criteria specified for evaluation (clear and accurate explanation of the expression and correct application to context) are straightforward and measurable.\n\n5. **Agent Performance**: The agent succeeded at the task, meaning it was able to provide a clear and concise explanation of the expression \"Break the ice\" and correctly interpret its application in the provided context.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not surprising.
