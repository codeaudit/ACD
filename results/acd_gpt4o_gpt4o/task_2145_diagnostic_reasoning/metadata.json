Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. The classic triad of meningitis symptoms includes fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Photophobia and nausea are also common symptoms associated with this condition. Confusion can occur as the infection progresses and affects the brain.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The hallmark symptoms of meningitis include severe headache, neck stiffness (due to the irritation of the meninges), photophobia (sensitivity to light), and systemic signs of infection such as fever and nausea.

The hallmark symptom of meningitis is neck stiffness, often accompanied by severe headaches and fever. Sensitivity to light (photophobia) and nausea are also common, as the inflammation affects the central nervous system. Confusion can result from the brain's involvement in the inflammatory process.

Key symptoms of meningitis include:\n\n1. **Fever**: A common response to infection.\n2. **Headache**: Often severe and persistent, reflecting inflammation and increased intracranial pressure.\n3. **Neck stiffness**: A hallmark of meningeal irritation.\n4. **Photophobia (sensitivity to light)**: Due to the irritation of the meninges.\n5. **Nausea and vomiting**: Resulting from increased intracranial pressure.\n6. **Confusion**: Reflecting the impact of inflammation on brain function.\n\nThe combination of these symptoms strongly suggests meningitis, distinguishing it from other conditions such as the flu or migraine, which might share some but not all these symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial, as meningitis can be life-threatening if not addressed quickly."

            "Diagnosis: Power supply failure\n\nRationale: The symptoms described - the computer won't start, the power light is off, and there is no fan noise - indicate a problem with the power delivery to the computer. The occasional beeping sound suggests that the motherboard is receiving some power and attempting to POST (Power-On Self-Test) but is unable to proceed further, which is often due to insufficient power. The recent storm could have caused a power surge or outage that damaged the power supply unit (PSU). Power surges are a common cause of PSU failure, as they can overwhelm the components designed to regulate and distribute power within the computer.
