Use wood glue on the contact surfaces and then secure with screws or bolts. Ensure they are aligned correctly.\n   - **Attach the Supports:** Attach the supports between the legs using screws and wood glue to add stability. Typically, there will be side supports and a front and back support.\n5. **Attach the Backrest:**\n   - **Position the Backrest:** Align the backrest with the rear legs. Apply wood glue at the contact points and secure with screws or bolts.\n6. **Final Tightening:** Go over all screws and bolts to ensure they are tight and the chair is sturdy.\n7. **Finishing Touches:**\n   - **Check for Stability:** Place the chair on a flat surface to ensure it does not wobble. Adjust if necessary.\n   - **Sand Any Rough Spots:** Sand any remaining rough spots and wipe down the chair to remove any dust.\n8. **Optional Finishing:** If desired, apply a wood finish or paint to protect the wood and enhance its appearance. Allow it to dry completely before use.\n\nSafety Precautions:\n- Always wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from wood dust and debris.\n- Use work gloves to protect your hands from splinters and sharp tools.\n- Ensure your workspace is well-ventilated, especially if using wood glue or finishing products.\n- Keep your work area clean to avoid tripping hazards.\n\nTips and Common Mistakes:\n- **Tip:** Pre-drill screw holes to prevent the wood from splitting.\n- **Tip:** Use clamps to hold parts in place while the glue dries for a stronger bond.\n- **Common Mistake:** Over-tightening screws can crack the wood. Tighten just enough to hold the parts securely.\n- **Common Mistake:** Not allowing enough drying time for glue or finish can weaken the assembly.

Sand all edges and surfaces to make them smooth.\n3. **Assemble the Seat Frame**: Place the four seat frame pieces together to form a rectangle. Apply wood glue at the joints and use clamps to hold them in place. Secure the joints with wood screws using the screwdriver.\n4. **Attach the Seat Board**: Place the seat board on top of the assembled frame. Ensure it is centered, then secure it with screws from the bottom of the frame.\n5. **Attach the Chair Legs**: Position the four legs at each corner of the seat frame. Ensure they are perpendicular to the seat. Apply wood glue at the joints, clamp, and secure them with screws.\n6. **Assemble the Backrest**: Attach the backrest support pieces to the back legs of the chair. Ensure they are at the same height on each side. Apply wood glue, clamp, and secure with screws.\n7. **Attach the Backrest Board**: Place the backrest board onto the support pieces. Apply wood glue, clamp, and secure with screws.\n8. **Reinforce the Structure**: Add additional support pieces between the legs if necessary, using wood glue and screws.\n9. **Sand the Entire Chair**: Once the chair is fully assembled, sand all surfaces again to ensure smoothness and remove any excess glue.\n10. **Finish the Chair**: Apply your chosen wood finish (varnish or paint) to the chair. Allow it to dry according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nSafety Precautions:\n- Always wear safety goggles and gloves when working with tools and wood.\n- Ensure proper ventilation when using wood glue and wood finish.\n- Keep a first aid kit nearby in case of minor injuries.\n\nTips and Common Mistakes:\n- **Tip**: Measure twice, cut once. Ensure all measurements are accurate before cutting or assembling.\n- **Mistake**: Rushing the drying process of wood glue can weaken joints. Always allow adequate drying time.\n- **Tip**: Pre-drill holes for screws to prevent the wood from splitting.\n- **Mistake**: Over-tightening screws can strip the wood. Tighten screws just enough to hold pieces securely.\n- **Tip**: Use clamps to hold pieces in place while the glue dries for a stronger bond."

            "content": "Given the task family `assembly_instructions_generation`, let's analyze the capabilities being assessed and the specific implementation details:\n\n1. **Capabilities Assessed**:\n   - **Procedural Understanding**: The LLM needs to understand the sequence of steps required to assemble or disassemble an object.\n   - **Clarity in Communication**: The instructions must be clear and easy to follow.\n   - **Attention to Detail**: The LLM must include all necessary details, such as tools, materials, safety precautions, and tips.\n\n2. **Human Difficulty**: Moderate. Humans with experience in assembling or disassembling objects typically find creating such instructions manageable but require attention to detail and clear communication skills.\n\n3. **Task Implementation**:\n   - The `get_tasks` method generates objects and actions (e.g., assembling a wooden chair, disassembling a desktop computer).\n   - The `get_instructions` method provides a template for the LLM to follow, ensuring that all required elements (tools, steps, safety precautions, tips) are specified.\n   - The `score` method uses `eval_with_llm_judge`, which implies that another LLM judges the quality of the generated instructions based on predefined criteria.\n\n4. **LLM Suitability**:\n   - LLMs are generally good at generating text, including procedural text like instructions, provided they have been trained on diverse and extensive datasets.\n   - An LLM judge is likely suitable for evaluating this task as it can compare the generated instructions to the criteria effectively.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the success of the LLM at generating detailed step-by-step instructions for assembling or disassembling everyday objects is expected. This type of task falls well within the capabilities of current advanced LLMs, especially those trained on large, diverse datasets that include instructional text.\n\n**Decision: No**"
