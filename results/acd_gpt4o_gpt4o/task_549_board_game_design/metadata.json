Components:**\n- 1 Game Board: Depicts a space route with various planets and obstacles.\n- 2 Player Tokens: Representing the spaceships of each player.\n- 20 Mission Cards: Each card describes a mission that players can complete.\n- 10 Obstacle Cards: These cards describe various space obstacles.\n- 10 Reward Tokens: Earned by completing missions.\n- 10 Penalty Tokens: Given when obstacles are encountered adversely.\n- 1 Six-Sided Die: Used to determine movement.\n\n**3. Setup:**\n1. Place the game board on a flat surface.\n2. Each player chooses a spaceship token and places it on the \"Earth Base\" starting point.\n3. Shuffle the mission cards and place them in a face-down pile.\n4. Shuffle the obstacle cards and place them in a face-down pile.\n5. Place the reward and penalty tokens in separate piles near the board.\n6. Decide who goes first by rolling the die; the highest roller starts.\n\n**4. Rules:**\n- **Movement:** Players take turns rolling the die and moving their token the corresponding number of spaces along the path.\n- **Mission Cards:** When landing on a planet, draw a mission card. If the mission is completed successfully (criteria on the card), the player receives a reward token.\n- **Obstacle Cards:** When landing on an obstacle space, draw an obstacle card and follow the instructions. These can either slow down progress or cause a penalty.\n- **Winning the Game:** The first player to collect 5 reward tokens and return to the Earth Base wins.\n\n**5. Example Turn:**\nPlayer A rolls a 4 and moves their spaceship token 4 spaces forward, landing on a planet. Player A draws a mission card which reads, \"Collect samples from Mars. Roll a 3 or higher to succeed.\" Player A rolls the die and gets a 5, successfully completing the mission and earning a reward token. The game state changes as Player A now has 1 reward token and the mission card is placed in a discard pile. Player B then takes their turn. \n\nThe game continues with players alternately taking turns, completing missions, encountering obstacles, and collecting reward tokens until one player achieves the goal of 5 reward tokens and returns to the Earth Base.",

Setup:**\n1. Place the game board in the center of the table.\n2. Each player selects a player token and places it on the Earth starting position.\n3. Shuffle the Space Artifact Cards and Event Cards separately and place them face down in two decks next to the board.\n4. Give each player 10 Fuel Tokens.\n5. Decide who goes first by rolling the die; the highest roll starts.\n\n**4. Rules:**\n- **Movement:** Players take turns rolling the die to move their token along the paths between planets. Each move consumes 1 Fuel Token.\n- **Collecting Artifacts:** When a player lands on a planet, they draw a Space Artifact Card from the deck. If it\u2019s a new artifact, they keep it. If they already have that artifact, they return it to the bottom of the deck.\n- **Event Cards:** If a player rolls a 6, they draw an Event Card and follow its instructions. Event Cards can provide extra fuel, allow additional movement, or cause setbacks.\n- **Winning the Game:** The first player to collect 5 unique space artifacts and return to Earth wins the game.\n\n**5. Example Turn:**\nPlayer 1\u2019s turn:\n1. Player 1 rolls the die and gets a 4.\n2. Player 1 moves their token 4 spaces towards Mars.\n3. Player 1 consumes 1 Fuel Token for the movement.\n4. Player 1 lands on Mars and draws a Space Artifact Card, obtaining the \u201cMartian Crystal.\u201d\n5. The game state updates: Player 1 now has 1 artifact and 9 Fuel Tokens remaining.\n6.
