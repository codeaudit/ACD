            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources initially, then build defenses, and finally, attack strategically.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3): Gather Resources**\n   - For the first three turns, prioritize gathering resources. This will ensure you have a strong base of resources to either build defenses or sustain attacks later in the game. With 3 turns of resource gathering, you will have sufficient resources to be flexible in your strategy.\n\n2. **Mid Game (Turns 4-6): Build Defenses**\n   - Once you have a stable amount of resources, start building defenses. This will reduce the damage you take from attacks, ensuring your resources last longer. Building defenses for three turns will help you withstand multiple attacks from opponents, increasing your survivability.\n\n3. **Late Game (Turn 7 onwards): Attack Strategically**\n   - After establishing a solid defense, begin attacking other players. Focus on targeting the weakest players (those with the least resources or defenses) to eliminate them quickly. This reduces the number of opponents and increases your chances of being the last player standing.\n   - Monitor the resource levels of other players. If a player is close to being eliminated, prioritize attacking them to remove them from the game.\n   - Balance your attacks with occasional resource gathering or defense building as needed to maintain an advantage.\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize your resource pool early on, ensure your defenses are robust enough to withstand attacks, and then strategically eliminate opponents when the timing is right. This balanced approach helps in adapting to the dynamic nature of the game and increases your chances of being the last player remaining.",
            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources and building defenses initially, then shift to attacking opponents once sufficiently fortified.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game - Resource Accumulation and Defense Building:**\n   - **Turns 1-3:** Gather resources on each turn. This will ensure you have a buffer of resources to sustain through the initial stages and prepare for future actions.\n   - **Turns 4-6:** Alternate between gathering resources and building defenses. This means you gather resources on turns 4 and 6, and build defenses on turn 5. This strategy helps you to stockpile resources while also starting to fortify your island to mitigate incoming attacks.\n\n2. **Mid Game - Strengthening Defenses:**\n   - **Turns 7-10:** Focus on building defenses. This will ensure that when you are attacked, the damage to your resources is minimized. By the end of this phase, your defenses should be robust, reducing the damage of incoming attacks by 3.\n\n3. **Late Game - Offensive Strategy:**\n   - **Turns 11 and onward:** Start attacking opponents. By this time, your defenses should be strong enough to withstand multiple attacks with minimal damage. Utilize your accumulated resources to sustain through this aggressive phase, and aim to deplete your opponents' resources quickly by consistently attacking them. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Resource Gathering Initial Focus:** Gathering resources early on is crucial because it gives you a buffer and the flexibility to execute other actions without the immediate risk of running out of resources.\n- **Building Defenses Mid Game:** Building defenses as you gather resources ensures that you are not left vulnerable to attacks, which could otherwise quickly deplete your resources.\n- **Offensive Late Game:** Once your defenses are strong, you can switch to an offensive strategy and attack consistently. Strong defenses will minimize the impact of any counterattacks, allowing you to deplete the resources of your opponents effectively. \n\nThis strategy balances resource acquisition, defensive preparation, and timely aggression to maximize the chances of being the last player standing.",
            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources in the initial turns, then alternate between building defenses and attacking opponents in the later stages.\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. **Initial Phase (First 5-7 Turns):**\n   - Prioritize gathering resources to build a strong stockpile. This is crucial because having more resources will provide flexibility and sustainability in the long run.\n   - Since each gathering action increases resources by 1, you will accumulate a substantial amount of resources, allowing you to respond to attacks and continue building defenses.\n\n2. **Mid Game (Next 5-7 Turns):**\n   - Begin alternating between building defenses and gathering resources. Building defenses will reduce the damage from future attacks, allowing you to conserve resources.\n   - Continue gathering resources intermittently to maintain a steady supply. This balance ensures you are not overly vulnerable while still growing your resource pool.\n\n3. **Late Game (Remaining Turns):**\n   - Shift focus towards attacking opponents and building defenses. With a solid resource base and defenses in place, you can afford to be more aggressive.\n   - Attacking will decrease opponents' resources by 2 each turn, hastening their depletion. Meanwhile, maintain your defenses to mitigate incoming attacks.\n   - By this stage, opponents are likely to have fewer resources due to earlier aggression or lack of resource management, making your attacks more effective.\n\n4. **Final Stage:**\n   - Once opponents are significantly weakened, intensify your attacks to quickly deplete their remaining resources.\n   - Ensure your defenses are strong enough to withstand any final desperate attacks from remaining players.\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize resource accumulation early on, build robust defenses mid-game, and strategically deplete opponents' resources in the late game, increasing your chances of being the last player remaining.",
            "Strategy: Prioritize defense in the early game, gather resources mid-game, and attack strategically in the late game.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3): Build Defenses** - During the initial turns, focus on building defenses. This will ensure that you are better protected against early attacks from other players, reducing the likelihood of losing resources quickly. Building defenses early on will decrease the damage you take from attacks by 1, which can be crucial in maintaining your resource levels.\n\n2. **Mid-Game (Turns 4-6): Gather Resources** - After establishing a solid defense, shift your focus to gathering resources. By increasing your resources, you\u2019ll have a buffer to withstand attacks and also be in a position to launch stronger attacks later. Gathering resources during the mid-game allows you to build up a surplus, which can be vital for both defense and offense.\n\n3. **Late Game (Turn 7 and beyond): Attack Strategically** - Once you have a good resource base and defenses, start attacking other players strategically. Target players who have lower defenses or are resource-poor, as they will be easier to eliminate. By decreasing their resources by 2 with each attack, you can systematically reduce the number of opponents. Continue to monitor and balance your own resource levels to ensure you can sustain attacks without running out of resources yourself.\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize your chances of being the last player remaining by initially protecting yourself, then building up your resources, and finally eliminating opponents through calculated attacks.",
            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources early in the game, then transition to building defenses, and finally, launch targeted attacks on the weakest opponents.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3): Gather Resources**\n   - In the initial turns, gather resources to build a strong foundation. This ensures you have enough food, wood, and stone to sustain yourself and build defenses when needed. The extra resources will also allow you to withstand early attacks from other players.\n\n2. **Mid Game (Turns 4-6): Build Defenses**\n   - Once you have a decent amount of resources, start building defenses. This will reduce the damage you take from opponents' attacks, allowing you to preserve your resources longer. Building defenses early in the mid-game prevents other players from easily depleting your resources.\n\n3. **Late Game (Turn 7 and beyond): Targeted Attacks**\n   - In the late game, observe which players have the fewest resources and begin attacking them. Targeting weaker players first increases your chances of quickly eliminating them from the game. This reduces the number of opponents and increases your chances of being the last player remaining. Continue to gather resources and build defenses as needed to maintain your advantage.\n\nBy following this strategy, you ensure that you have a robust resource pool to draw from, mitigate the impact of enemy attacks, and systematically eliminate competitors. This balanced approach of resource management, defense building, and strategic attacking maximizes your chances of winning the game."

            "Strategy: Start at the center of the grid (cell [3, 3]). From the center, move outward in a spiral pattern, checking each cell for hints. Follow the hints to narrow down the potential location of the treasure.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Starting Point**: The center of the grid (cell [3, 3]) is chosen because it minimizes the maximum distance to any cell on the board, providing a balanced starting point.\n2. **Spiral Pattern**: Moving in a spiral pattern ensures that all cells are checked systematically without retracing steps unnecessarily. This pattern covers the entire board efficiently.\n3. **Hint Utilization**: Upon encountering a hint, use the information provided to adjust the search pattern. For example, if a hint suggests the treasure is in a specific direction, prioritize cells in that direction to narrow down the search area.\n4. **Minimizing Moves**: By starting at the center and using a systematic pattern, combined with intelligent use of hints, the strategy aims to minimize redundant moves and quickly direct the player towards the treasure.\n\nThis strategy balances systematic searching with adaptive hint utilization, aiming to find the treasure in the fewest moves possible.",
            "Strategy: Start at the center of the grid (position (3, 3)) and use a spiral search pattern moving outward.\n\nExplanation: Starting at the center of the grid (position (3, 3)) is the most efficient initial position because it minimizes the maximum distance to any cell on the board. From this central point, conduct a spiral search pattern moving outward. This pattern ensures that you cover all cells systematically and will likely encounter hints early on due to the central start position.\n\nThe spiral search pattern is as follows:\n1. Start at (3, 3).\n2. Move: right \u2192 down \u2192 left \u2192 left \u2192 up \u2192 up \u2192 right \u2192 right \u2192 right \u2192 down \u2192 down \u2192 down \u2192 left \u2192 left \u2192 left \u2192 left \u2192 up \u2192 up \u2192 up \u2192 up \u2192 right \u2192 right \u2192 right \u2192 right \u2192 right \u2192 down \u2192 down \u2192 down \u2192 down \u2192 down.\n\nThis pattern covers the entire grid efficiently. When you land on a hint cell, use the clue to adjust your search direction accordingly. Given the symmetry of the grid, this approach ensures that you explore the most central and likely hint-containing cells first, reducing the overall number of moves required to find the treasure.",
            "Strategy: Start from the center of the grid (cell (3,3)) and perform a spiral search pattern moving outward. First move right, then down, then left, then up, repeating this pattern while expanding the spiral radius by one cell after completing a full loop.\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. **Starting Point**: Begin from the center of the grid (cell (3,3)). Starting from the center minimizes the maximum distance to any cell on the grid, ensuring that no cell is too far from the starting position.\n\n2. **Movement Pattern**: Implement a spiral search pattern. This involves moving in the following sequence:\n   - Right\n   - Down\n   - Left\n   - Up\n\n   After completing a full loop (right, down, left, up), expand the radius of the spiral by one cell. This means that after moving to the initial cells (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,3), the next moves would be (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2), and so on.\n\n3. **Hint Cells**: If a hint cell is encountered, use the clue to adjust the search pattern accordingly.

            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources initially, then build defenses, and finally, attack strategically.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3): Gather Resources**\n   - For the first three turns, prioritize gathering resources. This will ensure you have a strong base of resources to either build defenses or sustain attacks later in the game. With 3 turns of resource gathering, you will have sufficient resources to be flexible in your strategy.\n\n2. **Mid Game (Turns 4-6): Build Defenses**\n   - Once you have a stable amount of resources, start building defenses. This will reduce the damage you take from attacks, ensuring your resources last longer. Building defenses for three turns will help you withstand multiple attacks from opponents, increasing your survivability.\n\n3. **Late Game (Turn 7 onwards): Attack Strategically**\n   - After establishing a solid defense, begin attacking other players. Focus on targeting the weakest players (those with the least resources or defenses) to eliminate them quickly. This reduces the number of opponents and increases your chances of being the last player standing.\n   - Monitor the resource levels of other players. If a player is close to being eliminated, prioritize attacking them to remove them from the game.\n   - Balance your attacks with occasional resource gathering or defense building as needed to maintain an advantage.\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize your resource pool early on, ensure your defenses are robust enough to withstand attacks, and then strategically eliminate opponents when the timing is right. This balanced approach helps in adapting to the dynamic nature of the game and increases your chances of being the last player remaining.",
            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources and building defenses initially, then shift to attacking opponents once sufficiently fortified.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game - Resource Accumulation and Defense Building:**\n   - **Turns 1-3:** Gather resources on each turn. This will ensure you have a buffer of resources to sustain through the initial stages and prepare for future actions.\n   - **Turns 4-6:** Alternate between gathering resources and building defenses. This means you gather resources on turns 4 and 6, and build defenses on turn 5. This strategy helps you to stockpile resources while also starting to fortify your island to mitigate incoming attacks.\n\n2. **Mid Game - Strengthening Defenses:**\n   - **Turns 7-10:** Focus on building defenses. This will ensure that when you are attacked, the damage to your resources is minimized. By the end of this phase, your defenses should be robust, reducing the damage of incoming attacks by 3.\n\n3. **Late Game - Offensive Strategy:**\n   - **Turns 11 and onward:** Start attacking opponents. By this time, your defenses should be strong enough to withstand multiple attacks with minimal damage. Utilize your accumulated resources to sustain through this aggressive phase, and aim to deplete your opponents' resources quickly by consistently attacking them. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Resource Gathering Initial Focus:** Gathering resources early on is crucial because it gives you a buffer and the flexibility to execute other actions without the immediate risk of running out of resources.\n- **Building Defenses Mid Game:** Building defenses as you gather resources ensures that you are not left vulnerable to attacks, which could otherwise quickly deplete your resources.\n- **Offensive Late Game:** Once your defenses are strong, you can switch to an offensive strategy and attack consistently. Strong defenses will minimize the impact of any counterattacks, allowing you to deplete the resources of your opponents effectively. \n\nThis strategy balances resource acquisition, defensive preparation, and timely aggression to maximize the chances of being the last player standing.",
            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources in the initial turns, then alternate between building defenses and attacking opponents in the later stages.\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. **Initial Phase (First 5-7 Turns):**\n   - Prioritize gathering resources to build a strong stockpile. This is crucial because having more resources will provide flexibility and sustainability in the long run.\n   - Since each gathering action increases resources by 1, you will accumulate a substantial amount of resources, allowing you to respond to attacks and continue building defenses.\n\n2. **Mid Game (Next 5-7 Turns):**\n   - Begin alternating between building defenses and gathering resources. Building defenses will reduce the damage from future attacks, allowing you to conserve resources.\n   - Continue gathering resources intermittently to maintain a steady supply. This balance ensures you are not overly vulnerable while still growing your resource pool.\n\n3. **Late Game (Remaining Turns):**\n   - Shift focus towards attacking opponents and building defenses. With a solid resource base and defenses in place, you can afford to be more aggressive.\n   - Attacking will decrease opponents' resources by 2 each turn, hastening their depletion. Meanwhile, maintain your defenses to mitigate incoming attacks.\n   - By this stage, opponents are likely to have fewer resources due to earlier aggression or lack of resource management, making your attacks more effective.\n\n4. **Final Stage:**\n   - Once opponents are significantly weakened, intensify your attacks to quickly deplete their remaining resources.\n   - Ensure your defenses are strong enough to withstand any final desperate attacks from remaining players.\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize resource accumulation early on, build robust defenses mid-game, and strategically deplete opponents' resources in the late game, increasing your chances of being the last player remaining.",
            "Strategy: Prioritize defense in the early game, gather resources mid-game, and attack strategically in the late game.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3): Build Defenses** - During the initial turns, focus on building defenses. This will ensure that you are better protected against early attacks from other players, reducing the likelihood of losing resources quickly. Building defenses early on will decrease the damage you take from attacks by 1, which can be crucial in maintaining your resource levels.\n\n2. **Mid-Game (Turns 4-6): Gather Resources** - After establishing a solid defense, shift your focus to gathering resources. By increasing your resources, you\u2019ll have a buffer to withstand attacks and also be in a position to launch stronger attacks later. Gathering resources during the mid-game allows you to build up a surplus, which can be vital for both defense and offense.\n\n3. **Late Game (Turn 7 and beyond): Attack Strategically** - Once you have a good resource base and defenses, start attacking other players strategically. Target players who have lower defenses or are resource-poor, as they will be easier to eliminate. By decreasing their resources by 2 with each attack, you can systematically reduce the number of opponents. Continue to monitor and balance your own resource levels to ensure you can sustain attacks without running out of resources yourself.\n\nBy following this strategy, you maximize your chances of being the last player remaining by initially protecting yourself, then building up your resources, and finally eliminating opponents through calculated attacks.",
            "Strategy: Focus on gathering resources early in the game, then transition to building defenses, and finally, launch targeted attacks on the weakest opponents.\n\nExplanation: \n1. **Early Game (Turns 1-3): Gather Resources**\n   - In the initial turns, gather resources to build a strong foundation. This ensures you have enough food, wood, and stone to sustain yourself and build defenses when needed. The extra resources will also allow you to withstand early attacks from other players.\n\n2. **Mid Game (Turns 4-6): Build Defenses**\n   - Once you have a decent amount of resources, start building defenses. This will reduce the damage you take from opponents' attacks, allowing you to preserve your resources longer. Building defenses early in the mid-game prevents other players from easily depleting your resources.\n\n3. **Late Game (Turn 7 and beyond): Targeted Attacks**\n   - In the late game, observe which players have the fewest resources and begin attacking them. Targeting weaker players first increases your chances of quickly eliminating them from the game. This reduces the number of opponents and increases your chances of being the last player remaining. Continue to gather resources and build defenses as needed to maintain your advantage.\n\nBy following this strategy, you ensure that you have a robust resource pool to draw from, mitigate the impact of enemy attacks, and systematically eliminate competitors. This balanced approach of resource management, defense building, and strategic attacking maximizes your chances of winning the game."
