The average global temperature has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past century. This has led to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods. Scientists are urging immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, there are significant impacts on biodiversity, agriculture, and human health. For example, the melting of polar ice caps has resulted in rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting crop yields, leading to food insecurity in some regions.

Hence, if `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 directly without making any further recursive calls.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**:\n   - If `n` is greater than 1, the function calls itself with the argument `n - 1`.\n   - This step represents the recursive call, where the function `factorial(n)` returns `n * factorial(n - 1)`.\n   - Each call to the function reduces the value of `n` by 1, gradually approaching the base case.\n\n4. **How Recursion Unfolds**:\n   - When `factorial(5)` is called, it will compute `5 * factorial(4)`.\n   - To compute `factorial(4)`, it will compute `4 * factorial(3)`.\n   - This pattern continues until it reaches the base case: `factorial(1)`, which returns 1.\n   - The recursion then unwinds, with each call returning its result to the previous call:\n     - `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`\n     - `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`\n     - `factorial(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`\n     - `factorial(5)` returns `5 * 24 = 120`\n\nThus, the function correctly calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.",

It is denoted by `n!`. For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n2. **Base Case**: In recursion, the base case is the condition that stops the recursion. For factorial, the base case occurs when `n` is 0 or 1. Both 0! and 1! are defined as 1. This is checked using `if n == 0 or n == 1`.\n\n3. **Recursive Case**: If the base case is not met, the function calls itself with `n - 1`. This is the recursive step, where `factorial(n)` is defined as `n * factorial(n - 1)`. For example, to calculate `factorial(5)`, the function needs to calculate `5 * factorial(4)`. This pattern continues until the base case is reached.\n\n4. **Execution Flow**:\n    - `factorial(5)` calls `factorial(4)`\n    - `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)`\n    - `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)`\n    - `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)`\n    - `factorial(1)` returns 1 (base case)\n    - Now, the function returns from the recursive calls:\n        - `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`\n        - `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`\n        - `factorial(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`\n        - `factorial(5)` returns `5 * 24 = 120`\n\nThus, the recursion unwinds and the final result, `120`, is returned for `factorial(5)`.",

For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n\n2. **Base Case**: The simplest case for factorial is when n is 0 or 1. By definition, 0! = 1 and 1! = 1.

This approach builds up the Fibonacci sequence by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\n3. **Recursion**:\n    - For example, `fibonacci(7)` will lead to the following chain of calls:\n      - `fibonacci(7)` calls `fibonacci(6)` and `fibonacci(5)`\n      - `fibonacci(6)` calls `fibonacci(5)` and `fibonacci(4)`\n      - `fibonacci(5)` calls `fibonacci(4)` and `fibonacci(3)`\n      - This process continues until the base cases are reached.\n    - Once the base cases are reached (when `n` is 0 or 1), the function starts returning values back up the chain, eventually summing the results to get the final Fibonacci number.\n\nNote:\n- This implementation has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n) due to the repeated calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers. For large values of `n`, an iterative approach or memoization would be more efficient.",
            "Function:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases: return n if n is 0 or 1\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return n\n    # Recursive case: sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers\n    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks if `n` is either 0 or 1. These are the base cases because the first two Fibonacci numbers are defined as:\n   - fibonacci(0) = 0\n   - fibonacci(1) = 1\n   If `n` is 0 or 1, the function directly returns `n`.\n\n2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function proceeds to the recursive case. The Fibonacci number at position `n` is defined as the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers:\n   - fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n   This recursive call breaks the problem into smaller subproblems by calling `fibonacci(n - 1)` and `fibonacci(n - 2)`, and summing their results.\n\n3. **Recursion Breakdown**: The recursion continues breaking down the problem until it hits the base cases. For example, to calculate `fibonacci(7)`, the function calls:\n   - fibonacci(7) = fibonacci(6) + fibonacci(5)\n   - fibonacci(6) = fibonacci(5) + fibonacci(4)\n   - fibonacci(5) = fibonacci(4) + fibonacci(3)\n   - and so on, until it reaches the base cases of `fibonacci(1)` and `fibonacci(0)`.\n\n4. **Combining Results**: Once the base cases are reached, the function combines these results step-by-step going back up the call stack. The intermediate results are summed up to get the final Fibonacci number for the original input `n`.\n\nThis recursive approach is straightforward but can be inefficient for large values of `n` due to repeated calculations. For better performance, techniques like memoization or iterative methods are often used.",
            "Answer: \n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Base Cases**: The function `fibonacci` first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the function returns 0 because the Fibonacci sequence is typically considered to start from 0 for `fibonacci(0)`. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 because the first Fibonacci number is 1.\n\n2. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function calls itself recursively to compute the previous two Fibonacci numbers (`fibonacci(n - 1)` and `fibonacci(n - 2)`) and returns their sum. This is based on the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:\n   - `fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)`\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Execution for fibonacci(7)**:\n   - `fibonacci(7)` calls `fibonacci(6)` and `fibonacci(5)`\n   - `fibonacci(6)` calls `fibonacci(5)` and `fibonacci(4)`\n   - `fibonacci(5)` calls `fibonacci(4)` and `fibonacci(3)`\n   - `fibonacci(4)` calls `fibonacci(3)` and `fibonacci(2)`\n   - `fibonacci(3)` calls `fibonacci(2)` and `fibonacci(1)`\n   - `fibonacci(2)` calls `fibonacci(1)` and `fibonacci(0)`\n   - `fibonacci(1)` returns 1 (base case)\n   - `fibonacci(0)` returns 0 (base case)\n   - Moving back up the recursive calls:\n     - `fibonacci(2)` returns `1 + 0 = 1`\n     - `fibonacci(3)` returns `1 + 1 = 2`\n     - `fibonacci(4)` returns `2 + 1 = 3`\n     - `fibonacci(5)` returns `3 + 2 = 5`\n     - `fibonacci(6)` returns `5 + 3 = 8`\n     - `fibonacci(7)` returns `8 + 5 = 13`\n\nThus, `fibonacci(7)` evaluates to 13.",
            "Answer: \n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nExplanation: \nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The recursive function `fibonacci(n)` calculates the nth Fibonacci number using the following steps:\n\n1. **Base Case 1 (n <= 0)**: If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0. This handles any invalid input by returning 0.\n2. **Base Case 2 (n == 1)**: If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. This is because the first Fibonacci number is defined to be 1.\n3. **Recursive Case (n > 1)**: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers. It does this by calling itself twice: `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`, and then summing the results.\n\nThis recursive approach works by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, each of which is solved by further breaking it down until the base cases are reached. The results of the base cases are then combined to give the final result.\n\nFor example, to calculate `fibonacci(7)`:\n\n- `fibonacci(7)` calls `fibonacci(6)` and `fibonacci(5)`\n- `fibonacci(6)` calls `fibonacci(5)` and `fibonacci(4)`\n- `fibonacci(5)` calls `fibonacci(4)` and `fibonacci(3)`\n- This continues until `fibonacci(1)` and `fibonacci(0)` are reached, which return 1 and 0, respectively.\n- The results are then combined and propagated back up the call stack to give the final result.\n\nThis process involves a lot of repeated calculations, which makes the recursive solution less efficient for large values of `n`. In practice, iterative solutions or memoization are used to optimize the calculation of Fibonacci numbers."
