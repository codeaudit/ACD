This requires logical thinking and pattern recognition, which are within the capabilities of advanced LLMs. However, the visual nature of the task (interpreting a grid) adds complexity.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The scoring relies on `eval_with_llm_judge`, which means another LLM evaluates the solution. While this can work for textual tasks, it might be less reliable for spatial reasoning tasks that require precise visual interpretation and adherence to specific rules.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM agent in solving a spatial reasoning puzzle, particularly one involving a grid with specific rules, is indeed surprising. This is because it demonstrates the model's ability to handle tasks that are typically outside the primary scope of LLMs' capabilities (which are more text-based).\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
