Main Melody (16 bars) - Swing rhythm and blue notes\n   Cmaj7 - G7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n   Cmaj7 - F7 - Cmaj7 - G7\n   Cmaj7 - G7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n   Cmaj7 - F7 - Cmaj7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n\n3. Improvisation Section (8 bars) - Following the same chord progression with space for a solo instrument\n   Cmaj7 - G7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n   Cmaj7 - F7 - Cmaj7 - G7\n\n4. Recapitulation (16 bars) - Repeat the main melody with slight variations\n   Cmaj7 - G7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n   Cmaj7 - F7 - Cmaj7 - G7\n   Cmaj7 - G7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n   Cmaj7 - F7 - Cmaj7 - G7 - Cmaj7\n\n5. Ending (4 bars) - Swing rhythm, resolving on Cmaj7\n   Cmaj7 - Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7",

This includes identifying key signatures, recognizing modulations, and understanding musical structure.\n   \n2. **Creativity and Compositional Skills**: The task requires the LLM to generate a new musical composition adhering to specific criteria, such as composing in a minor key, including modulations, and maintaining coherence.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is classified as difficult, which implies high expectations for accuracy and creativity.\n\n4. **Automatic Scoring**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to score the LLM's output. This means the evaluation relies on another LLM's judgment, which may have limitations in understanding and evaluating musical compositions as accurately as a human expert. \n\nConsidering the complexity of the task and the required depth of understanding in music theory and composition, it is indeed surprising that the LLM succeeded. Musical composition is a highly specialized skill that typically requires extensive training and experience, and for an LLM to perform well in this domain is noteworthy.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
