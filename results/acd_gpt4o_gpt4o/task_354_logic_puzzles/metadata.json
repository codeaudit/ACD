Emma is sitting to the immediate left of the person who likes blue.\n3. Frank is sitting to the immediate right of the person who likes green.\n4. Grace does not like yellow.\n5. The person who likes green is sitting directly opposite the person who likes yellow.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. The person who likes red is sitting directly opposite David. Therefore, David does not like red.\n2. Emma is sitting to the immediate left of the person who likes blue. Thus, Emma does not like blue.\n3. Frank is sitting to the immediate right of the person who likes green. Therefore, Frank does not like green.\n4. Grace does not like yellow.\n5. The person who likes green is sitting directly opposite the person who likes yellow. Therefore, green and yellow cannot be adjacent.\n\nFrom these clues, we begin to deduce the seating arrangement and color preferences:\n\n- Since the person who likes red is sitting directly opposite David, and the person who likes green is directly opposite the person who likes yellow, David must be either the one who likes green or yellow. \n- If David liked green, the person directly opposite him would like yellow, but Frank would be to the immediate right of David, which is not consistent with the clue that Frank is to the immediate right of the person who likes green.\n- Therefore, David likes yellow, and the person directly opposite him likes green. Frank must be to the immediate right of the person who likes green.\n- Emma is to the immediate left of the person who likes blue, and Grace does not like yellow, so she must like either red, blue, or green.\n\nNow we place the individuals:\n\n- David likes yellow and cannot be opposite Emma (who is to the left of blue), so Emma cannot be opposite David.\n- Emma must be either to the left or right of the person who likes blue, placing her opposite either Frank or Grace.\n\nThe final seating arrangement and color preferences are:\n- David sits opposite the person who likes green (Grace).\n- Emma sits to the immediate left of the person who likes blue (Frank).\n\nThus, we have:\n- David: Yellow\n- Emma: Red\n- Frank: Blue\n- Grace: Green\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1.

The person who likes yellow is to the left of the person who likes blue, meaning blue and yellow are adjacent.\n\nThrough elimination:\n\n- If Grace liked red, David would be opposite Grace, which means Grace's favorite color is red, and David cannot like red. This fits.\n- Emma cannot be next to blue, so Grace or Frank must like blue.\n- Since David is opposite red, and the person who likes yellow is to the left of blue, Grace must like blue, and yellow must be to the left of Grace.\n- This leaves Emma to like green, opposite Frank. \n\nSo the seating arrangement and color preferences are:\n\n- David: Yellow (David is opposite red)\n- Emma: Green (Emma is opposite Frank, who is not sitting next to blue)\n- Frank: Blue (Blue is to the left of Grace)\n- Grace: Red (Grace's favorite color is not yellow)\n\nThus, the final arrangement:\n\nDavid (Yellow) \u2014 Emma (Green) \u2014 Frank (Blue) \u2014 Grace (Red)",

The following clues will help you determine where each person is sitting and their favorite color.\n\n**Clues:**\n\n1. The person who likes red is sitting immediately to the left of David.\n2. Emma is not seated next to Grace.\n3. Frank's favorite color is neither red nor green.\n4. The person who likes blue is sitting at one of the ends.\n5. Grace is sitting to the immediate right of the person who likes yellow.\n6. David is seated next to the person who likes green.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Since the person who likes blue is at one of the ends, we need to check both ends. \n2. If blue is at the left end: \n   - Possible order: Blue, ?, ?, ?\n   - David cannot be at the left end because someone needs to be to his left. So, if David is second: Blue, David, ?, ?\n   - The person who likes red must be immediately to the left of David: Blue, Red (?), David, ?\n   - Grace must be right of yellow: Blue, Red (?), David, Yellow, Grace (invalid because fifth person).\n   - Grace must be right of yellow: Blue, Red (?), David, Grace, Yellow (invalid because yellow is at the end).\n3. Therefore, blue must be at the right end:\n   - Possible order: ?, ?, ?, Blue\n   - David must be second or third: \n     - If David is third: ?, Red, David, Blue (invalid since green is not next to blue)\n     - If David is second: ?, David, ?, Blue\n4. Thus, the valid order is: Red, David, Green, Blue\n5. Grace must be immediate right of yellow: Red, David, Yellow, Grace (invalid since Grace is blue)\n6. Valid order: Red, David, Green, Blue\n7. Emma is not next to Grace:\n   - Emma must be at the left end: Emma, David, Green, Grace (invalid as Emma is not next to Grace)\n   - Emma must be at the second: Red, Emma, Green, Blue\n8. Frank must be the last person:\n   - Emma, David, Grace, Frank\n   - Emma must be green: Emma (Green), David, Grace, Frank\n   - Frank must be blue: Frank (Blue)\n   - David must be yellow: David (Yellow)\n   - Red is to the left of David: Red, David (Yellow), Grace, Frank (Blue)\n\nThus, the final seating arrangement and favorite colors are:\n\n- Emma (Green)\n- David (Yellow)\n- Grace (Red)\n- Frank (Blue)\n\n**Final Solution:**\n\n1.

The person who likes blue is sitting immediately to the right of David.\n2. Grace's favorite color is green.\n3. Frank is sitting to the immediate left of the person whose favorite color is red.\n4. Emma is not sitting next to Frank.\n5. The person who likes yellow is not sitting at either end of the row.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Grace's favorite color is green (Clue 2).\n2.

Emma is not sitting next to Frank (Clue 4).\n5. The person who likes yellow is not at either end (Clue 5).\n\nLet's solve the puzzle step by step:\n\n- Since the person who likes yellow is not at either end (Clue 5), yellow must be the favorite color of the second or third person.\n- The person who likes blue is immediately to the right of David (Clue 1), so David cannot be at the far right.\n- Grace likes green (Clue 2), and since Grace cannot sit next to Frank (Clue 4), Frank cannot be left of Grace.\n\nConsider Grace in each position:\n\n- If Grace is first, then David must be second, and the person who likes blue must be third. But this would place Frank directly to the left of the person who likes red (fourth), conflicting with Grace's position.\n- If Grace is second, then David must be first, and the person who likes blue must be third. However, there is no room for Frank to be immediately left of red without violating the yellow constraint.\n- If Grace is third, then David must be second, and the person who likes blue must be fourth. This does not conflict with any clues.\n- If Grace is fourth, then David must be third, and the person who likes blue must be second. But this places Frank in the first position, and Emma in the fourth, violating the constraints.\n\nTherefore, Grace must be third, David must be second, and the person who likes blue is fourth. The remaining color pairings and positions must be as follows:\n\n- Grace (Green) - third\n- David (Red) - second\n- Person who likes blue - fourth\n- Frank must be first to satisfy the left-of-red constraint.\n\nThe only person left for the second position is Emma, who likes yellow.\n\nFinal arrangement:\n1. Frank (Yellow)\n2. David (Red)\n3. Grace (Green)\n4.

The LLM needs to understand the spatial relationships and determine that Bob is in the middle.\n   - Current LLMs are generally capable of handling such logical reasoning tasks, especially when they are relatively simple and involve clear, linear relationships.\n\n2. **Creating a new logic puzzle**:\n   - The constraints provided involve creating a coherent, challenging, and solvable puzzle involving four people and their favorite colors, incorporating seating arrangements and color preferences.\n   - This task requires not only logical reasoning and pattern recognition but also a degree of creativity to generate a new, coherent puzzle.\n   - While this task is more complex, current LLMs have shown some capability in generating coherent and creative content based on given constraints, though with varying degrees of success.\n\n### Evaluation Considerations\n- **Evaluation by LLM judge**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function will evaluate the correctness and coherence of both the solution to the given puzzle and the generated puzzle. This function is suitable since it can assess the logical coherence and adherence to constraints in generated text.\n- **Human difficulty**: The estimated human difficulty is marked as \"difficult,\" particularly for generating a new puzzle. However, for LLMs, generating coherent text based on structured constraints is within their capabilities.\n\n### Decision\n- **Success in solving the puzzle**: Not surprising, as LLMs are capable of handling such logical reasoning tasks.\n- **Success in creating a new puzzle**: More noteworthy due to the complexity and creativity required, but still within the capabilities of current advanced LLMs.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM agent at the first task (solving the puzzle) is not surprising. The second task (creating a new puzzle) might be more challenging, but the LLM's success here is also within expected capabilities.\n\n**Decision: No**"
