They require some basic strategic reasoning but do not demand highly complex problem-solving skills or extensive planning. LLMs have shown proficiency in handling such structured, constrained problems.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: LLMs are generally good at following explicit instructions and generating logical sequences based on given rules. The task here involves moving a symbol ('X' or 'O') through a defined grid, adhering to movement constraints, which is well within the capabilities of advanced LLMs.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task uses an LLM-based evaluation (`eval_with_llm_judge`), which can effectively assess whether the provided solution adheres to the logical constraints and rules of the puzzle. As long as the evaluation criteria are clear and the LLM judge is reasonably accurate, this method should work well.\n\n4. **Expected Outcome**: Given the simplicity of the puzzle and the clear instructions, it is expected that a competent LLM can generate a valid move sequence to solve the puzzle.\n\nConsidering these factors, an expert in the field would not find the success of the LLM agent in this task surprising or noteworthy. The task is straightforward, and the capabilities of LLMs align well with the requirements.\n\nDecision: No"
