Your goal is to secure a salary of at least $80,000, but the employer's initial offer is $70,000.\n\nEnsure that your negotiation meets the following requirements:\nNegotiate effectively to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

This is a reasonable approach since it allows for automated and consistent evaluation.\n\n### Agent's Success\n- The agent succeeded at reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, which involves multiple exchanges and maintaining appropriate, contextually relevant responses.\n\n### Reasoning\n- While LLMs have shown proficiency in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text, successfully engaging in a complex negotiation scenario requiring empathy and strategic problem-solving is a higher-level task.\n- Given the estimated human difficulty of \"very difficult,\" it would be noteworthy if the LLM agent consistently succeeded at such tasks.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the above points, the agent's success at this very difficult task involving complex negotiation skills is indeed surprising.\n\nDecision: Yes"
