Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Visual Understanding**: The LLM is expected to understand and describe visual scenes based on textual descriptions. This is a complex task since it involves a form of mental imagery and detailed articulation.\n\n2. **Descriptive Ability**: The LLM must generate vivid and clear descriptions, capturing all relevant details such as people, objects, colors, and text.\n\n3. **Comparative Reasoning**: For the comparison task, the LLM needs to identify similarities and differences between two descriptions, which requires a deep understanding of both descriptions.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is described as difficult for humans, indicating high complexity and requiring nuanced understanding and articulation.\n\n5. **Evaluation Method**: The task uses an LLM-based judge to evaluate the descriptions and comparisons. This method must be robust enough to assess the quality and detail of the generated text accurately.\n\nGiven that the LLM succeeded at generating detailed descriptions and comparisons, this success is notable because:\n\n- Generating detailed and vivid descriptions from textual prompts demands advanced language understanding and creativity.\n- Comparative reasoning requires the LLM to process and analyze multiple descriptions accurately, which is non-trivial.\n- The task is inherently complex and challenging, even for humans.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM in this task family is indeed surprising and noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
