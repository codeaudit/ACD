Players must navigate the board, avoid traps, and strategically use chance cards to outsmart their opponents.\n\n3. Rules:\n- Players take turns in a clockwise direction.\n- On a player's turn, they roll a six-sided die and move their token the corresponding number of spaces.\n- Players can move in any direction but cannot move back to the same space within a single turn.\n- If a player lands on a space occupied by another player, they must go back to the nearest unoccupied space.\n- The board has designated spaces for treasure, traps, and chance cards.\n- Landing on a treasure space allows the player to collect a treasure token.\n- Landing on a trap space means the player loses their next turn.\n- Landing on a chance card space allows the player to draw a chance card and follow its instructions.\n- The first player to collect three treasure tokens and return to the starting point wins the game.\n\n4. Components:\n- 1 game board with a grid layout (10x10)\n- 4 player tokens (different colors)\n- 18 treasure tokens\n- 12 trap markers\n- 24 chance cards\n- 1 six-sided die\n\n5. Brief Description of Gameplay:\nTreasure Quest is a strategic and chance-driven board game where 2-4 players embark on an adventurous quest to collect treasures scattered across a grid-based board. Each player starts at the same point and rolls a die to move around the board, strategically deciding their path to avoid traps and maximize their chances of landing on treasure spaces. Chance cards add an element of unpredictability, offering both advantages and obstacles. Players must carefully balance risk and reward to be the first to gather the required treasures and make it back to the starting point, all within a 30-minute timeframe. The game is designed to be engaging with a mix of strategy and luck, ensuring an exciting experience for all participants.",

Objective\nThe objective of \"Treasure Quest\" is to be the first player to collect three treasure tokens by navigating the board, overcoming challenges, and using strategy and chance to outmaneuver opponents.\n\n3. Rules\n1. Setup: Place the game board in the center, shuffle the deck of challenge cards, and place them face down. Each player chooses a colored pawn and places it on the starting space.\n2. Turn Sequence:\n   a. Roll the dice: On your turn, roll a six-sided die and move your pawn forward the corresponding number of spaces.\n   b. Draw a Challenge Card: If you land on a challenge space (marked with a \"C\"), draw a challenge card and follow its instructions.\n   c. Treasure Space: If you land on a treasure space (marked with a \"T\"), collect a treasure token.\n3. Challenges: Challenge cards may include tasks such as answering a trivia question, performing a physical activity, or facing a chance event (e.g., lose a turn, move forward/backward).\n4. Winning: The first player to collect three treasure tokens wins the game.\n5. Additional Rules:\n   a.

Core Mechanics\n- **Turn-Based Play:** Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) in an empty cell.\n- **Win Conditions:** A player wins by being the first to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.\n- **Draw Condition:** The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled and no player has achieved the win condition.\n- **Simple Placement:** Players place one symbol per turn, and they cannot place a symbol in a cell that is already occupied.\n\n2. Player Experience\n- **Strategic Thinking:** Players must think ahead to block their opponent\u2019s moves and create opportunities for their own winning combinations.\n- **Quick Rounds:** Games are typically short, providing quick satisfaction or a quick reset if the game ends in a draw.\n- **Accessibility:** The simplicity of the rules makes it easy for players of all ages to understand and play.\n- **Competitive and Social:** The game fosters a competitive environment and can serve as a social activity between players, often leading to multiple rounds of play.\n\n3. Design Choices\n- **Minimalist Design:** The 3x3 grid is simple and easy to draw, making the game accessible with minimal materials.\n- **Binary Symbols:** The use of two distinct symbols (X and O) ensures clarity in identifying each player's moves.\n- **Symmetry:** The grid\u2019s symmetry means there is no inherent advantage to starting in any particular cell, although strategic depth comes from the player's choices.\n- **Universal Appeal:** The game's design does not rely on language or cultural knowledge, making it universally appealing.\n- **No Randomness:** The outcome is entirely based on player decisions, with no elements of chance, emphasizing skill and strategy.\n\nAnswer: 1.

This involves a degree of creativity and understanding of game mechanics, which are higher-order cognitive skills.\n\n2. **Analytical Thinking**:\n   - The second part of the task involves analyzing an existing game (Tic-Tac-Toe). This requires the LLM to understand and articulate core mechanics, player experience, and design choices. Analytical thinking is required to provide a meaningful and insightful analysis.\n\n3. **Instructions and Scoring**:\n   - The instructions provided to the LLM are clear and structured. The scoring method relies on an LLM judge, which evaluates based on predefined criteria.\n   - The criteria are well-defined and focus on the clarity, engagement, balance, and adherence to the specified structure for game design, as well as detailed and accurate analysis for the second task.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**:\n   - The task is estimated to be difficult for humans, implying that it requires substantial expertise and thoughtfulness.\n\nGiven these considerations, if the LLM agent succeeded at this task, it demonstrates a significant capability in both creative game design and analytical thinking. These are advanced skills, and it is noteworthy for an LLM to perform well in such a complex and multifaceted task.\n\n**Decision: Yes**"
