Chess endgames can be quite complex, even for experienced human players.\n\n2. **Current Capabilities of LLMs**: While LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text, understanding complex instructions, and even performing some level of reasoning, their ability to handle tasks requiring precise sequential logic, such as chess endgame strategies, is generally limited. Success in this area would typically require specialized training or integration with a dedicated chess engine.\n\n3. **Scoring Method**: The scoring method uses an LLM judge to evaluate the correctness and strategic explanation of the moves. This adds an additional layer of complexity, as the LLM judge must accurately assess the validity and strategic soundness of the moves.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is classified as very difficult for humans, which suggests that even expert human players might struggle without significant effort. \n\nGiven these points, an LLM's success in formulating a correct and strategic plan to achieve checkmate in two moves in a complex chess endgame scenario is indeed surprising and noteworthy. This success indicates that the LLM not only understands the rules and notation of chess but also possesses a level of strategic reasoning typically beyond the general capabilities of current LLMs.\n\nDecision: Yes"
