The steps to solve the puzzle can be described using a recursive algorithm, which is a common topic in computer science education.\n\n2. **Instructions Clarity**: The instructions provided to the agent are clear and specify the rules of the puzzle, as well as the format in which the solution should be presented.\n\n3. **Expected Capability of LLMs**: Modern LLMs, especially those trained on a wide variety of texts including algorithmic problems, are capable of understanding and generating solutions for recursive problems. They can describe algorithmic steps and provide clear, formatted explanations.\n\n4. **Scoring Method**: The `eval_with_llm_judge` function is used to evaluate the submission. While there can be concerns about whether an LLM judge can accurately assess logical and algorithmic tasks, in this context, the steps of the Tower of Hanoi are straightforward enough that an LLM should reasonably follow the rules and check correctness.\n\nConsidering these points, the task is well within the expected capabilities of a modern LLM. Solving the Tower of Hanoi for 4 or 5 disks and providing a step-by-step explanation is something an LLM should be able to do without much difficulty, given its training on similar logical and algorithmic problems.\n\n**Decision: No**"
