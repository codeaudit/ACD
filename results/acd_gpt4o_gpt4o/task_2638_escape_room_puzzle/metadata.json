They generally excel in tasks that require identifying sequences, following clear logical rules, and interpreting simple natural language instructions.\n\n2. **Task Complexity**: The escape room puzzles described involve:\n   - Deductive reasoning to determine which box contains the key (simple elimination based on given clues).\n   - Recognizing numerical sequences (doubling pattern).\n   - A chessboard knight movement problem that is a bit more complex but still within the realm of LLM capabilities.\n   - Basic arithmetic operations for the final combination lock code.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: Although the task is labeled as \"difficult\" for humans, the specific examples provided do not seem to be outside the typical capability range of modern LLMs. They can handle logical deductions, simple arithmetic, and sequence predictions well.\n\n4. **LLM Judge Suitability**: The use of `eval_with_llm_judge` for scoring is appropriate as the answers are clear and unambiguous. The criteria for correct answers are straightforward, and the judge can effectively compare the responses to the expected solutions.\n\nConsidering the above points, the success of the LLM on this task is not surprising. The tasks are well within the expected competence of a state-of-the-art LLM.\n\nDecision: No"
