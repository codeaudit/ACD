            "1. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a blender.\n   - Begin by selecting ripe avocados. Ripe avocados will yield to gentle pressure and have a darker green, almost black skin. \n   - Use a sharp knife to cut the avocado in half lengthwise, around the pit. Twist the two halves in opposite directions to separate them.\n   - Carefully remove the pit by gently tapping it with the knife and twisting it out, or use a spoon to scoop it out if you prefer.\n   - Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh from each half and place it directly into the blender. Ensure you get all the creamy flesh and avoid any parts that may be brown or spoiled.\n\n2. Add the cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt to the blender.\n   - Measure out 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and add it to the blender. Ensure the cocoa powder is unsweetened for a rich chocolate flavor.\n   - Measure 1/4 cup of maple syrup and pour it into the blender. Maple syrup adds natural sweetness and a hint of caramel flavor.\n   - Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the blender. The vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor and adds a subtle sweetness.\n   - Add a pinch of salt. This small amount of salt will help to balance the flavors and bring out the sweetness of the other ingredients.\n\n3. Blend until smooth and creamy.\n   - Secure the lid on the blender and blend the mixture on high speed. You may need to stop the blender occasionally to scrape down the sides with a spatula and ensure all ingredients are fully incorporated.\n   - Continue blending until the mixture is completely smooth and creamy with no lumps. The consistency should be similar to a traditional mousse.\n\n4. Transfer the mousse to serving bowls and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n   - Use a spatula to transfer the mousse from the blender into individual serving bowls. You can use small bowls, ramekins, or any dish suitable for serving dessert.\n   - Cover the bowls with plastic wrap or a lid to prevent the mousse from drying out or absorbing other odors in the refrigerator.\n   - Refrigerate the mousse for at least 30 minutes to allow it to firm up and develop a more mousse-like texture. This chilling time also enhances the flavors.\n   - Once chilled, the mousse is ready to serve. You can garnish it with fresh berries, a dollop of whipped cream, or a sprinkle of shaved chocolate if desired.",
            "1. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a blender.\n   - To start, ensure you have ripe avocados, which should give slightly to gentle pressure. Using a sharp knife, slice each avocado lengthwise around the pit. Twist the two halves in opposite directions to separate them. Carefully remove the pit by either scooping it out with a spoon or gently tapping it with the knife blade and twisting. Use a spoon to scoop out the flesh from each half and place it directly into the blender. Ensure that no skin or pit fragments are included.\n\n2. Add the cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt to the blender.\n   - Measure out 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and add it to the blender. Then, pour in 1/4 cup of maple syrup, ensuring it's evenly distributed. Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract for flavor. Finally, sprinkle a pinch of salt, which will enhance the overall taste by balancing the sweetness and bitterness. Make sure all ingredients are added to the blender with the avocado flesh.\n\n3. Blend until smooth and creamy.\n   - Secure the lid on the blender and blend the mixture on a medium to high setting. You may need to stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the blender with a spatula to ensure all ingredients are evenly mixed. Blend until the mixture reaches a smooth and creamy consistency, with no visible chunks of avocado or clumps of cocoa powder. This may take a few minutes, depending on the power of your blender.\n\n4. Transfer the mousse to serving bowls and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n   - Once the mousse is smooth and creamy, use a spatula to transfer it from the blender into individual serving bowls or cups. Aim for even portions. Place the filled bowls in the refrigerator and allow them to chill for at least 30 minutes. This chilling time helps the mousse to set and enhances the flavors. After 30 minutes, the mousse is ready to be served. Enjoy it cold for the best texture and taste.",
            "1. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a blender.\n   - Start by selecting ripe avocados, which will feel slightly soft when gently squeezed. \n   - Using a sharp knife, carefully cut each avocado lengthwise around the pit. Twist the two halves in opposite directions to separate them.\n   - To remove the pit, gently tap the pit with the blade of the knife so it lodges into the pit, then twist and lift out the pit.\n   - Use a spoon to scoop out the avocado flesh from each half and place it directly into a blender. Make sure to scrape out all the flesh to avoid waste.\n\n2. Add the cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt to the blender.\n   - Measure out 1/2 cup of cocoa powder and add it to the blender with the avocado flesh.\n   - Measure 1/4 cup of maple syrup and pour it into the blender. This will provide sweetness.\n   - Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to enhance the flavor.\n   - Lastly, add a pinch of salt. This will help to balance the sweetness and enhance the overall flavor of the mousse.\n\n3. Blend until smooth and creamy.\n   - Secure the lid on the blender before blending.\n   - Start blending on a low speed and gradually increase to high speed to ensure all ingredients are well combined.\n   - Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy, with no visible chunks of avocado or cocoa powder. This may take about 1-2 minutes, depending on the power of your blender.\n   - You may need to stop occasionally to scrape down the sides of the blender with a spatula to ensure all ingredients are incorporated evenly.\n\n4. Transfer the mousse to serving bowls and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n   - Use a spatula to transfer the smooth mousse from the blender into individual serving bowls.\n   - Cover the bowls with plastic wrap or a lid to prevent the mousse from absorbing any odors in the refrigerator.\n   - Place the bowls in the refrigerator and let them chill for at least 30 minutes. Chilling helps to firm up the mousse and enhance the flavors.\n   - After 30 minutes, the mousse will be ready to serve.

Modern LLMs, especially those fine-tuned on instructional data and procedural texts, generally perform well in generating and interpreting recipes. They are adept at understanding constraints (e.g., vegan recipes, no refined sugar) and can produce coherent, logically ordered instructions.\n\nThe success of the LLM agent in generating a compliant vegan dessert recipe and interpreting a given recipe accurately aligns with the expected capabilities of current LLM models.
