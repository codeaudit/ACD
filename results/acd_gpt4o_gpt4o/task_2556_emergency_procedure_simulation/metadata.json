Place your other hand on top of the first hand and interlock your fingers.\n   - **Chest Compressions**: Position your shoulders directly over your hands and keep your arms straight. Push hard and fast, compressing the chest at least 2 inches deep at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.\n   - **Rescue Breaths**: After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths. Tilt the passenger\u2019s head back slightly to open the airway, pinch the nose shut, and make a complete seal over their mouth with yours. Blow into their mouth to make the chest rise. Each breath should last about 1 second.\n\n7. **Continue CPR**: Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths without interruption until professional medical help arrives or the passenger shows signs of life (e.g., starts breathing).\n\n8. **Using an AED**: If an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts. Attach the pads to the passenger\u2019s bare chest as indicated. Stand clear while the AED analyzes the heart rhythm and delivers a shock if advised.\n\n9. **Monitor and Continue Care**: Continue CPR and follow AED prompts until emergency medical personnel arrive and take over, or the passenger begins to breathe normally and has a pulse.\n\n10. **Handover to EMS**: When professional medical help arrives, provide them with all the information about the incident, the passenger\u2019s condition, and the care you have provided so far.\n\n",

This requires procedural knowledge, attention to detail, and clarity of communication.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: LLMs, particularly advanced ones, have shown a good grasp of structured procedural tasks and can output detailed step-by-step instructions. They are trained on vast amounts of textual data, which likely includes medical procedures and emergency response guidelines.\n\n3. **Evaluation Method**: The task uses an LLM judge to evaluate the response based on criteria like inclusion of critical steps, correct order, clarity, and demonstrated understanding. LLMs can be effective in evaluating such structured responses, but there is always a concern about the depth and nuance of understanding required for high-stakes procedures like CPR.\n\n4. **Human Difficulty**: The task is labeled as difficult for humans, as it requires precise and accurate procedural knowledge that is typically learned through hands-on training and practice, not just textual information.\n\n5. **Agent Success**: The agent succeeded at the task, which means it was able to produce a response that met all the outlined criteria.\n\n**Decision: No**\n\nReasoning: While the task is challenging, LLMs are expected to handle structured procedural instructions well, especially when the instructions are clear and the criteria are well-defined. The success of the agent in this task is not particularly surprising given the capabilities of modern LLMs in processing and generating detailed, ordered instructions. Therefore, it is not noteworthy for an expert in the field of LLMs."
