Any type of paper will do, but standard printer paper is recommended for beginners.\n\n2. **Fold the Paper in Half Lengthwise**\n   - Place the paper on a flat surface in portrait orientation (the longer sides are vertical).\n   - Fold the paper in half lengthwise, bringing the right edge over to meet the left edge.\n   - Crease the fold sharply, then unfold the paper to its original position.\n\n3. **Fold the Top Corners to the Center**\n   - With the paper still in portrait orientation, take the top right corner and fold it downwards to meet the center crease. \n   - Repeat the same step with the top left corner, folding it downwards to meet the center crease. This should form a triangle shape at the top of the paper.\n\n4. **Fold the Top Edges to the Center**\n   - Take the newly formed right edge (diagonal edge) and fold it towards the center crease so that it aligns with the center fold.\n   - Do the same with the left diagonal edge, folding it towards the center crease.\n   - This will create a narrower, more elongated triangle.\n\n5. **Create the Wings**\n   - Fold the paper in half along the original center crease, with all previous folds inside.\n   - Place the paper horizontally so that the longer side is facing you and the pointed tip is to the right.\n   - From the folded edge, measure about 1 inch down and fold the top layer down to create the first wing. Crease sharply.\n   - Flip the paper over and repeat the same step on the other side to create the second wing, ensuring both wings are even.\n\n6. **Adjust the Wings**\n   - Hold the airplane by the middle with the wings spread out evenly.\n   - Adjust the wings slightly upward to create a slight dihedral angle, which will help the plane glide better.\n\n7. **Test Your Paper Airplane**\n   - Find an open space and gently throw your paper airplane forward. Adjust the folds as needed to improve flight performance.\n\nNote: Minor adjustments to the wings or nose can improve flight stability and distance.",

Fold the paper in half lengthwise to create a crease, then unfold it.\n\n3. **Create the Nose**: Take the top corners of the paper and fold them down towards the center crease, forming two triangular flaps that meet at the center line.\n\n4. **Fold Down the Top Edges**: Fold the top edges of the paper down towards the center crease again, creating a sharper triangular point at the top.\n\n5. **Fold in Half Again**: Fold the paper in half along the original center crease, keeping the pointed nose on the outside.\n\n6. **Create the Wings**: Lay the folded paper so the crease is on the right side. Fold one side down to create the first wing, aligning the edge with the bottom of the plane.

Place the paper on a flat surface in a portrait orientation (long sides on the left and right, short sides on the top and bottom).\n\n2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise by bringing the left edge over to meet the right edge. Crease the fold sharply, then unfold the paper to return it to its original position.\n\n3. Take the top left corner of the paper and fold it down to meet the center crease line, creating a triangle. Repeat this step with the top right corner, so both top corners meet at the center crease, forming a point at the top.\n\n4.

Any type of paper will do, but standard printer paper is recommended for beginners.\n\n2. **Fold the Paper in Half Lengthwise**\n   - Place the paper on a flat surface in portrait orientation (the longer sides are vertical).\n   - Fold the paper in half lengthwise, bringing the right edge over to meet the left edge.\n   - Crease the fold sharply, then unfold the paper to its original position.\n\n3. **Fold the Top Corners to the Center**\n   - With the paper still in portrait orientation, take the top right corner and fold it downwards to meet the center crease. \n   - Repeat the same step with the top left corner, folding it downwards to meet the center crease. This should form a triangle shape at the top of the paper.\n\n4. **Fold the Top Edges to the Center**\n   - Take the newly formed right edge (diagonal edge) and fold it towards the center crease so that it aligns with the center fold.\n   - Do the same with the left diagonal edge, folding it towards the center crease.\n   - This will create a narrower, more elongated triangle.\n\n5. **Create the Wings**\n   - Fold the paper in half along the original center crease, with all previous folds inside.\n   - Place the paper horizontally so that the longer side is facing you and the pointed tip is to the right.\n   - From the folded edge, measure about 1 inch down and fold the top layer down to create the first wing. Crease sharply.\n   - Flip the paper over and repeat the same step on the other side to create the second wing, ensuring both wings are even.\n\n6. **Adjust the Wings**\n   - Hold the airplane by the middle with the wings spread out evenly.\n   - Adjust the wings slightly upward to create a slight dihedral angle, which will help the plane glide better.\n\n7. **Test Your Paper Airplane**\n   - Find an open space and gently throw your paper airplane forward. Adjust the folds as needed to improve flight performance.\n\nNote: Minor adjustments to the wings or nose can improve flight stability and distance.",

This is a straightforward comprehension and description task.\n- The task also involves creating a new set of procedural instructions for a different task. This tests the generation capability of the LLM.\n- The scoring relies on an LLM judge, which, if implemented correctly, should be able to evaluate the clarity and logical sequencing of the instructions generated by the agent.\n\n### Agent Success:\nGiven the above points, the success of the LLM agent on this task is not surprising. The task falls well within the known capabilities of advanced LLMs, which are proficient in text comprehension and generation, particularly for procedural and instructional content.\n\nDecision: No"
