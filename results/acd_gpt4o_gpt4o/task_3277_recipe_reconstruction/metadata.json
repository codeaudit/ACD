Prepare the ingredients: Dice the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Finely chop the onion and garlic. Cut the bell pepper into thin strips.\n2. In a large skillet or pot, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the diced chicken breast and season with the 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of black pepper. Cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n3. In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring frequently to avoid burning.\n4. Add the bell pepper strips to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.\n5. Add the 1 cup of rice to the skillet and stir to combine with the vegetables. Toast the rice for about 1-2 minutes, which will enhance its flavor.\n6. Pour in the 1 cup of chicken broth and add the 1 tsp of paprika. Stir well to ensure the paprika is evenly distributed.\n7. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the skillet with a lid and simmer for about 15-18 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed the broth.\n8. Once the rice is cooked, add the cooked chicken back into the skillet. Stir everything together and let it heat through for another 2-3 minutes.\n9. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Serve the savory chicken and rice dish hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.\n\nEnjoy your delicious chicken and rice dish with a mix of colorful vegetables and a hint of paprika!"
