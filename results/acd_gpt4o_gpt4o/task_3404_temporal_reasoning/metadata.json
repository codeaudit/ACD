The step-by-step example helps guide the model on how to approach the problem. LLMs are usually good at understanding and following structured instructions.\n\n3. **Automated Scoring with LLM Judge**: The scoring method uses `eval_with_llm_judge`, which can sometimes introduce variability in evaluation. However, assuming the LLM used for judging is proficient in understanding logical correctness and temporal sequences, this method should be adequate for scoring.\n\n4. **Estimated Human Difficulty**: While the task is labeled as \"difficult\" for humans due to the need for careful sequential calculations, LLMs are well-suited for this kind of task as long as the logic is straightforward and the instructions are clear.\n\nSince the agent succeeded at this task, it aligns well with the expected capabilities of current LLMs. Therefore, I do not find this result to be particularly surprising or noteworthy.\n\nDecision: No"
