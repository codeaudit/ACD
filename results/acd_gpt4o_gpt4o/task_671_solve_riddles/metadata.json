The average global temperature has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past century. This has led to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods. Scientists are urging immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, there are significant impacts on biodiversity, agriculture, and human health. For example, the melting of polar ice caps has resulted in rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities.
