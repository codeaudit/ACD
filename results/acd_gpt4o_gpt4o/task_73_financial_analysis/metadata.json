Finally, I will offer recommendations to improve profitability based on the observed trends.\n\nGiven data:\nRevenue: {t['revenue']}\nExpenses: {t['expenses']}\n\nCalculations:\n1. Calculate the total profit for each quarter:\n   - Quarter 1: Profit = Revenue[0] - Expenses[0]\n   - Quarter 2: Profit = Revenue[1] - Expenses[1]\n   - Quarter 3: Profit = Revenue[2] - Expenses[2]\n   - Quarter 4: Profit = Revenue[3] - Expenses[3]\n\n2.
