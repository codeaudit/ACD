            "1. Solution: The current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 amperes (A).\n\n2. Explanation: \n\nTo find the current flowing through the circuit, we can use Ohm's Law, which states:\n\n\\[ V = I \\cdot R \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( V \\) is the voltage across the circuit,\n- \\( I \\) is the current flowing through the circuit,\n- \\( R \\) is the total resistance of the circuit.\n\nGiven:\n- The voltage \\( V \\) is 9 volts (V),\n- The resistance \\( R \\) is 100 ohms (\u03a9).\n\nWe need to solve for the current \\( I \\). Rearranging Ohm's Law to solve for \\( I \\), we get:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{R} \\]\n\nNow, substituting the given values into the equation:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{9\\ \\text{V}}{100\\ \\text{\u03a9}} \\]\n\n\\[ I = 0.09\\ \\text{A} \\]\n\nTherefore, the current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 amperes (A).\n\n### Detailed Explanation of the Principles and Steps Involved:\n\n1. **Ohm's Law**: The foundation of this calculation is Ohm's Law, which relates the voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. The formula \\( V = I \\cdot R \\) indicates that the voltage across a resistor is equal to the product of the current flowing through the resistor and its resistance.\n\n2. **Series Circuit**: In a series circuit, the current that flows through each component is the same because there is only one path for the current to take. Therefore, the current measured through the resistor will be the same as that through the light bulb and the battery.\n\n3. **Substituting Known Values**: By knowing the total voltage provided by the battery (9 volts) and the total resistance in the circuit (100 ohms), we can apply these values directly into Ohm\u2019s Law to find the current.\n\n4. **Calculation**: By dividing the voltage (9 V) by the resistance (100 \u03a9), we determine the current flowing through the circuit. The calculation shows that the current is 0.09 A.\n\nIn summary, using Ohm's Law and understanding the properties of a series circuit allows us to calculate the current flowing through the circuit as 0.09 amperes.",
            "1. Solution: The current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 amperes (A).\n\n2. Explanation: \n\nTo solve for the current flowing through the circuit, we use Ohm's Law, which states that \\( V = IR \\), where:\n- \\( V \\) is the voltage (in volts)\n- \\( I \\) is the current (in amperes)\n- \\( R \\) is the resistance (in ohms)\n\nGiven:\n- The voltage of the battery, \\( V = 9 \\) volts\n- The resistance of the resistor, \\( R = 100 \\) ohms\n\nSince the resistor and the light bulb are in series, the total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the resistor's resistance and the light bulb's resistance. However, the problem doesn't specify the resistance of the light bulb, so we'll assume it to be negligible for this calculation. Hence, the total resistance \\( R_{total} \\) is approximately 100 ohms.\n\nUsing Ohm's Law, rearrange the formula to solve for the current \\( I \\):\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{R} \\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{9 \\text{ volts}}{100 \\text{ ohms}} \\]\n\n\\[ I = 0.09 \\text{ amperes} \\]\n\nThus, the current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 A.\n\nThe underlying principle here is Ohm's Law, which relates voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components. Because we assume the light bulb's resistance is negligible, the total resistance is primarily due to the resistor. Therefore, applying Ohm's Law directly provides the current flowing through the circuit.",
            "1. Solution: The current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 amperes (A).\n\n2. Explanation: \nTo determine the current flowing through a series circuit, we can use Ohm's Law, which is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering. Ohm's Law states that the current (I) flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the conductor. The relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{R} \\]\n\nGiven the components in the circuit:\n- A 9-volt battery (V = 9V)\n- A 100-ohm resistor (R = 100\u03a9)\n- A light bulb (we assume the resistance of the light bulb is negligible compared to the resistor for this calculation)\n\nThe total resistance in the circuit is dominated by the 100-ohm resistor. Using Ohm's Law:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{R} = \\frac{9V}{100\u03a9} = 0.09A \\]\n\nThus, the current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 amperes (A).\n\nIn summary, the solution involves applying Ohm's Law to the given series circuit, taking into account the voltage provided by the battery and the resistance of the resistor to find the current.",
            "1. Solution: The current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 amperes (A).\n\n2. Explanation:\nTo determine the current flowing through the circuit, we can use Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law states that the current (I) flowing through a resistor is equal to the voltage (V) across the resistor divided by the resistance (R) of the resistor. The formula is:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{R} \\]\n\nGiven the values:\n- Voltage (V) = 9 volts\n- Resistance (R) = 100 ohms\n\nWe can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{9 \\text{ volts}}{100 \\text{ ohms}} \\]\n\n\\[ I = 0.09 \\text{ amperes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the current flowing through the circuit is 0.09 A (or 90 milliamperes, mA).\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n1. **Ohm's Law**: This fundamental principle of electronics relates the voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in a linear resistor. The relationship is described by the equation \\( V = IR \\). In other words, the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, with the constant of proportionality being the resistance.\n\n2. **Series Circuit**: In a series circuit, all components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for the current.

Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the principles of physics related to free fall and the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.\n\n### Steps and Principles:\n\n1. **Identify the known quantities:**\n   - Mass of the object (m): 2 kg (Note: The mass is not required to solve for velocity in this case.)\n   - Height (h): 10 meters\n   - Acceleration due to gravity (g): \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)\n   - Initial velocity (\\(v_i\\)): 0 m/s (since the object is dropped)\n\n2. **Equation of motion:**\n   We will use the kinematic equation that relates the initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and distance traveled:\n   \\[\n   v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2gh\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\(v_f\\) is the final velocity (what we are solving for)\n   - \\(v_i\\) is the initial velocity\n   - \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity\n   - \\(h\\) is the height\n\n3. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**\n   \\[\n   v_f^2 = 0^2 + 2 \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times 10 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_f^2 = 196 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(v_f\\):**\n   \\[\n   v_f = \\sqrt{196 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v_f = 14 \\, \\text{m/s}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the object just before it hits the ground is 14 meters per second.\n\n### Explanation of Principles:\n\n- **Free Fall:** When an object is dropped from a height, it is subject to the force of gravity, which causes it to accelerate downward at a constant rate of \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) (assuming we are near the surface of the Earth and ignoring air resistance).\n\n- **Kinematic Equations:** These equations describe the motion of objects under constant acceleration. In this problem, we specifically used the equation that relates the initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and displacement to find the final velocity of the falling object.\n\n- **Energy Considerations (Optional):** Alternatively, one could use the conservation of energy principle, where potential energy at the height is converted to kinetic energy just before impact. However, the kinematic approach is straightforward and directly applicable here.\n\nThus, by understanding these principles and applying the appropriate kinematic equation, we can determine the final velocity of the falling object.",
            "1. Solution: The velocity of the object just before it hits the ground is 14 m/s.\n\n2. Explanation: To solve this problem, we use the principles of physics related to free fall and gravitational acceleration.\n\nWhen an object is dropped from a height, it is subjected to the force of gravity. Assuming there is no air resistance, the only force acting on the object is gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at a constant rate. This acceleration due to gravity is denoted by \\( g \\) and has an approximate value of \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\).\n\nWe can use the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion to find the final velocity just before the object hits the ground. The relevant equation is:\n\n\\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a d \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_f \\) is the final velocity,\n- \\( v_i \\) is the initial velocity,\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration,\n- \\( d \\) is the distance fallen.\n\nIn this problem:\n- The initial velocity \\( v_i \\) is 0 m/s (since the object is dropped and not thrown),\n- The acceleration \\( a \\) is \\( 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) (due to gravity),\n- The distance \\( d \\) is 10 meters.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ v_f^2 = 0 + 2 \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times 10 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\\[ v_f^2 = 196 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2 \\]\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{196 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2} \\]\n\\[ v_f = 14 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the object just before it hits the ground is 14 m/s.\n\nThe principles involved include the concept of free fall under the influence of gravity and the use of kinematic equations to describe the motion of the object. The key steps are identifying the initial conditions (initial velocity and height), recognizing the constant acceleration due to gravity, and applying the appropriate kinematic formula to find the final velocity."
