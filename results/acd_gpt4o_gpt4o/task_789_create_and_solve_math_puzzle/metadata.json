Industrialization marked a shift to powered, special-purpose machinery, factories and mass production.\n\nThe iron and textile industries, along with the development of the steam engine, played central roles in the Industrial Revolution, which also saw improved systems of transportation, communication and banking.

            "Puzzle:\nIn triangle ABC, point D is on side BC such that BD = DC. Point E is on side AC such that AE:EC = 2:1. The line segment BE intersects AD at point F. If the area of triangle ABC is 180 square units, find the area of triangle AFD.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we will use properties of similar triangles and ratios.\n\n1. First, observe that since BD = DC, D is the midpoint of BC. Therefore, AD is a median of triangle ABC.\n2. Given AE:EC = 2:1, we have AE = 2x and EC = x for some positive value x. Thus, AC = AE + EC = 3x.\n3. Let the area of triangle ABC be 180 square units. Since D is the midpoint of BC, AD divides triangle ABC into two triangles of equal area. Each of these triangles (ABD and ADC) has an area of 90 square units.\n\nNow, we will focus on the line segment BE intersecting AD at point F:\n4. Since AE:EC = 2:1, and BE intersects AD at F, we need to find the ratio of AF:FD.\n\nUsing the properties of mass points:\n5. Assign a mass of 1 to point C, making the mass of point A twice that of point C (since AE:EC = 2:1).\n6. Therefore, the mass of point E is 1 (from C) + 2 (from A) = 3.\n7. Since D is the midpoint of BC, it has equal masses from B and C, giving it a total mass of 1 + 1 = 2.\n8. The mass of point B can be determined using the fact that BE intersects AD at F. The mass of B must equal the sum of the masses of A and C, which is 2 + 1 = 3.\n9. With these mass assignments, point F, where BE intersects AD, divides AD in the ratio of the masses of B and D, which is 3:2.\n\n10. Therefore, AF:FD = 3:2.\n\nNow, determine the area of triangle AFD:\n11. Since AF:FD = 3:2, F divides AD into segments such that AF = 3k and FD = 2k for some positive value k.\n12. The area of triangle AFD is proportional to the length of AF relative to AD. The length of AD is divided by the ratio 3:2, meaning AF covers 3/5 of AD.\n\n13. Since AD divides triangle ABC into two equal areas (90 each), and AF covers 3/5 of AD:\n14. The area of triangle AFD is (3/5) of the area of triangle ABD, which is 90 square units.\n\n15. Therefore, the area of triangle AFD is (3/5) * 90 = 54 square units.\n\nAnswer: The area of triangle AFD is 54 square units.",
