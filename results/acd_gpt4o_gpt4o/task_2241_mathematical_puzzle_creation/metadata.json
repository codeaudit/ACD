The original rectangular field has a length that is 4 meters more than twice the width. If the area of the new section (original rectangle + square plot) is 400 square meters, and the side length of the square plot is equal to the width of the rectangle, what are the dimensions of the original rectangular field?\n\n2.

Given this information, determine the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) for the quadratic equation representing the archway. Then, confirm the quadratic equation by solving it and showing that it has a unique real solution at the maximum height.\n\n2. Solution: \nFirst, we use the given information to set up the quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\).\n\n1. **Touching the ground at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\):** Since the archway touches the ground at these points, these are the roots of the quadratic equation.

Substituting \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 10 \\) into the quadratic equation:\n   \\[\n   10 = a(2)^2 - 4a(2)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   10 = 4a - 8a\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10 = -4a\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   a = -\\frac{10}{4} = -\\frac{5}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Finding \\( b \\) and \\( c \\):** Now that we have \\( a = -\\frac{5}{2} \\), we substitute \\( a \\) back into the equation \\( y = ax^2 - 4ax \\):\n   \\[\n   y = -\\frac{5}{2}x^2 + 10x\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation for the archway is:\n\\[\ny = -\\frac{5}{2}x^2 + 10x\n\\]\n\nTo confirm the quadratic equation has a unique real solution at the maximum height: The vertex form of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c \\) has its maximum (or minimum) at \\( x = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).

The length of the garden is \\( w + 2 \\) meters. Given that the area is 36 square meters, we set up the equation \\( w \\times (w + 2) = 36 \\).

The rectangle has a length of 12 units and a width of 8 units. One of the shorter sides of the rectangle is adjacent to the diameter of the semicircle, which has a radius of 4 units. The right-angled triangle is positioned such that its hypotenuse forms the other shorter side of the rectangle, and one of its legs lies along the width of the rectangle, while the other leg extends vertically upwards from the rectangle's top edge.\n\nCalculate the total area of this composite shape.\n\n2. Solution:\nTo find the total area of the complex shape, we need to calculate the areas of the individual geometric figures (the rectangle, the semicircle, and the right-angled triangle) and then sum these areas.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle.**\nThe area \\( A_{\\text{rectangle}} \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A_{\\text{rectangle}} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\]\nGiven:\n- Length = 12 units\n- Width = 8 units\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{rectangle}} = 12 \\times 8 = 96 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the area of the semicircle.**\nThe area \\( A_{\\text{semicircle}} \\) of a semicircle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A_{\\text{semicircle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi r^2 \\]\nGiven:\n- Radius \\( r \\) = 4 units\n\n\\[ A_{\\text{semicircle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi (4)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi \\times 16 = 8\\pi \\text{ square units} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the area of the right-angled triangle.**\nThe area \\( A_{\\text{triangle}} \\) of a right-angled triangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ A_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\nIn this problem, the base of the triangle is equal to the width of the rectangle (8 units), and the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the hypotenuse is equal to the side of the rectangle (8 units).\n\nLet the legs of the triangle be \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), and the hypotenuse be \\( c \\):\n\\[ a = 8 \\text{ units (width of the rectangle)} \\]\n\\[ c = 8 \\text{ units (side of the rectangle)} \\]\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ 8^2 = 8^2 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ 64 = 64 + b^2 \\]\n\\[ b^2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ b = 0 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nIn this case, the right-angled triangle degenerates into a line with no area. This was an oversight in the initial problem setup. Therefore, we should instead consider a different configuration or correct the dimensions. However, based on the given setup, we proceed with the remaining areas.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the areas of the individual shapes.**\n\\[ A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{rectangle}} + A_{\\text{semicircle}} + A_{\\text{triangle}} \\]\n\\[ A_{\\text{total}} = 96 + 8\\pi + 0 \\]\n\nThus, the total area of the composite shape is:\n\\[ A_{\\text{total}} = 96 + 8\\pi \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[ A_{\\text{total}} = 96 + 8\\pi \\text{ square units} \\]",

He wants the length of the garden to be 2 meters more than its width. Can you help John find the dimensions of his garden by solving an appropriate quadratic equation?\n\n2. Solution:\nTo solve this problem, we start by letting the width of the garden be \\( w \\) meters. According to the puzzle, the length of the garden is \\( w + 2 \\) meters. The area of the garden can be represented by the product of its length and width.\n\nGiven that the area is 36 square meters, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[\nw \\times (w + 2) = 36\n\\]\n\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n\\[\nw^2 + 2w = 36\n\\]\n\nTo form a standard quadratic equation, we rearrange the terms:\n\\[\nw^2 + 2w - 36 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve the quadratic equation \\( w^2 + 2w - 36 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula, \\( w = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = -36 \\).\n\nFirst, we calculate the discriminant (\\( \\Delta \\)):\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \\times 1 \\times (-36) = 4 + 144 = 148\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, we have two real solutions. We then apply the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{148}}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{148}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{37}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{37}\n\\]\n\nWe have two potential solutions:\n\\[\nw = -1 + \\sqrt{37} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w = -1 - \\sqrt{37}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( w \\) represents the width of the garden, it must be a positive value. Thus, we discard the negative solution \\( w = -1 - \\sqrt{37} \\).\n\nTherefore, the width \\( w \\) is:\n\\[\nw = -1 + \\sqrt{37}\n\\]\n\nTo find the length, we use the relation \\( l = w + 2 \\):\n\\[\nl = (-1 + \\sqrt{37}) + 2 = 1 + \\sqrt{37}\n\\]\n\nThus, the dimensions of the garden are:\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = -1 + \\sqrt{37} \\approx 5.08 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 1 + \\sqrt{37} \\approx 7.08 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, John should make his garden approximately 5.08 meters wide and 7.08 meters long to achieve the desired area of 36 square meters.\n\nAnswer: \nPuzzle Description: John is planning to build a rectangular garden and wants its area to be exactly 36 square meters. He wants the length of the garden to be 2 meters more than its width. Can you help John find the dimensions of his garden by solving an appropriate quadratic equation?\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we let the width of the garden be \\( w \\) meters. The length of the garden is \\( w + 2 \\) meters. Given that the area is 36 square meters, we set up the equation \\( w \\times (w + 2) = 36 \\). This expands to \\( w^2 + 2w = 36 \\), which rearranges to \\( w^2 + 2w - 36 = 0 \\). Using the quadratic formula, we find the width \\( w = -1 + \\sqrt{37} \\approx 5.08 \\) meters. The length is \\( l = 1 + \\sqrt{37} \\approx 7.08 \\) meters. Therefore, the dimensions of the garden are approximately 5.08 meters wide and 7.08 meters long."
