This approach keeps the resource levels balanced and ensures that there are no unnecessary delays due to lacking one type of resource.\n\nAfter building the first house, the strategy continues to gather resources in a balanced manner to build the second house quickly, followed by the farm.

This approach guarantees the shortest route without encountering any obstacles, ensuring the goal is achieved efficiently.",

Move down to (4, 4)\n\nExplanation:\nThe strategy starts by moving the character from the initial position (0, 0) to the right along the row until it reaches the position (0, 4). This avoids any obstacles and makes use of direct horizontal movement. From (0, 4), the character moves straight down the column, avoiding all obstacles and reaching the treasure at (4, 4).\n\n- Each move is chosen to avoid the positions with obstacles: (2, 2), (3, 2), and (1, 3).\n- The total number of moves is 8, which is the fewest possible since it involves direct horizontal and vertical movement without detours.\n- This strategy ensures that the character reaches the treasure efficiently by minimizing the number of turns and avoiding any blocked paths.\n",

Move south to (4, 4)\n\nExplanation:\nThe strategy involves moving east along the bottom row until reaching the eastern boundary of the grid. From there, the character moves south, staying in the easternmost column. This path avoids all the obstacles located at (2, 2), (3, 2), and (1, 3), ensuring a clear route to the treasure at (4, 4).\n\nThe total number of moves is 8, which is the fewest possible given the constraints and the obstacles:\n- 4 moves east from (0, 0) to (4, 0)\n- 4 moves south from (4, 0) to (4, 4)\n\nThis path minimizes the steps needed and avoids unnecessary detours, ensuring a direct route to the goal.",

Move north to (4, 4)\n\nExplanation:\nThe strategy involves moving the character in an optimal path to minimize the number of moves while avoiding obstacles. By moving east four times, the character reaches the far right column of the grid, effectively bypassing obstacles that are positioned in the central and left parts of the grid. From the rightmost column, moving north directly towards the treasure ensures that no obstacles are encountered. This path consists of a total of 8 moves: 4 moves east and 4 moves north. Since the grid is 5x5, the most direct path from (0, 0) to (4, 4) without considering obstacles would normally take 8 moves (4 east and 4 north), making this strategy the shortest possible route given the constraints."

This allows the player to make efficient use of the initial resources and quickly move towards the next goal.\n- After building the farm, the strategy switches to gathering the remaining resources needed for the houses. This approach avoids wasting any turns by ensuring that resources are gathered in the most efficient sequence.\n- By always gathering the maximum possible resources per turn and building structures as soon as the required resources are available, this plan minimizes the total number of turns needed to achieve the goal.\n\nThe strategy is logically sound and ensures that the player accumulates the necessary resources in the shortest amount of turns while balancing the need to build each type of structure promptly.",

After the initial resources are gathered, focusing on building the first house ensures that progress towards the goal is tangible early on. \n\nThe key is to gather resources in the most efficient way, alternating between wood and stone when necessary to minimize the number of turns spent gathering. This approach keeps the resource levels balanced and ensures that there are no unnecessary delays due to lacking one type of resource.\n\nAfter building the first house, the strategy continues to gather resources in a balanced manner to build the second house quickly, followed by the farm. By gathering slightly more wood initially and then balancing the stone gathering, the strategy ensures that resources for each structure are available just in time for construction, thereby minimizing the total number of turns.\n\nThe turn-by-turn plan accounts for the specific needs of each structure (10 wood and 5 stone for a house, 15 wood and 10 stone for a farm) and ensures that resource gathering is done with minimal excess. This method ensures the goal is met in the fewest possible turns, which is 17 turns in total.",

We start with 10 units of wood and 5 units of stone. \n\nThe strategy focuses on alternating between gathering wood and stone to efficiently stockpile the required resources. Initially, we prioritize gathering wood because both houses and the farm require more wood than stone. \n\nWe first gather enough wood to build the first house (turns 1-3), then gather stone to meet the house\u2019s requirements (turns 4-5).
