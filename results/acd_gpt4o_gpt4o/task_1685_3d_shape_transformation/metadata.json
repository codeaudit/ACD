            "Answer: \nResulting Shape Description:\n- Orientation: After rotating 90 degrees around the x-axis, the faces of the cube that were perpendicular to the y-axis are now perpendicular to the z-axis. This means that if the cube initially had its faces aligned with the x, y, and z axes, the face that was facing upward along the y-axis is now facing forward along the z-axis, and the face that was facing forward along the z-axis is now facing downward along the y-axis.\n- Position: The cube is translated up by 3 units along the y-axis, so its center is now located 3 units higher in the y-direction than its initial position.\n- Size: The cube is scaled by a factor of 2, so its side length is now twice its original length. If the original cube had side lengths of 1 unit, the new side lengths are 2 units each.",

If we assume the initial orientation had its faces aligned with the coordinate planes, after the rotation, the face that was originally on the front (facing the positive y-axis) will now face the positive z-axis, the face that was on top (facing the positive z-axis) will now face the negative y-axis, and so on.\n- Position: The cube is translated up by 3 units along the y-axis. If the initial position of the cube was centered at the origin (0,0,0), it is now centered at (0,3,0).\n- Size: The cube is scaled by a factor of 2.

            "Answer: \nResulting Shape Description:\n- Orientation: The cube has been rotated 90 degrees around the x-axis. This means that the original faces of the cube oriented along the y-axis and z-axis have swapped positions. If the cube initially had its faces aligned parallel to the x, y, and z axes, now the face that was originally on top (along the positive y-axis) is now facing forward (along the positive z-axis), and the face that was originally facing forward is now facing downward (along the negative y-axis).\n- Position: The cube has been translated up by 3 units. Assuming the initial position of the cube's center was at the origin (0, 0, 0), the new position of the center of the cube is now at (0, 3, 0).\n- Size: The cube has been scaled by a factor of 2.

            "Answer: \nResulting Shape Description:\n- Orientation: After the 90-degree rotation around the x-axis, the cube is oriented such that the face that was initially on the top is now facing forward, the face that was initially facing forward is now on the bottom, and the other faces are accordingly shifted.\n- Position: The cube is translated up by 3 units along the y-axis from its original position. If the initial position of the cube's center was at (0,0,0), the new center position after translation is (0,3,0).\n- Size: The cube is scaled by a factor of 2, so each edge of the cube will be twice its original length.
