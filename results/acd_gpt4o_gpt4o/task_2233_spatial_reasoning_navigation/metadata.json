Given the current capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Spatial Reasoning**: LLMs are primarily trained on large corpora of text and do not have intrinsic spatial reasoning capabilities. However, they can infer and generate directions if they have been trained on sufficient examples of similar tasks.\n  \n2. **Descriptive Language**: LLMs are generally good at generating coherent and contextually appropriate text, including descriptive language for directions.\n\n3. **Evaluation by LLM Judge**: The task involves automatic scoring using an LLM judge, which may introduce some variability in evaluation. However, the criteria specified are clear and should be within the capabilities of current LLMs to satisfy.\n\nGiven these considerations, the success of the LLM agent in this task should be evaluated in the context of how well it handles spatial reasoning and directional language. \n\nSince spatial reasoning is a non-trivial task for LLMs, especially in the context of interpreting and generating accurate paths through a maze or directions on a map, an LLM succeeding at this task is indeed noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
