Solution to the problem:\n\nTo find the intersection points of the parabola \\( y = x^2 \\) and the line \\( y = 2x + 3 \\), we need to set the equations equal to each other and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x^2 = 2x + 3 \\]\n\nRearrange the equation to set it to zero:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \\]\n\nNext, we solve this quadratic equation by factoring:\n\n\\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the solutions are:\n\n\\[ x = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -1 \\]\n\nNow, we find the corresponding \\( y \\)-coordinates by substituting these \\( x \\)-values back into either of the original equations. Using the line equation \\( y = 2x + 3 \\):\n\nFor \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 2(3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \\]\n\nFor \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 2(-1) + 3 = -2 + 3 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the intersection points are:\n\n\\[ (3, 9) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (-1, 1) \\]\n\n2. Visual description of the solution:\n\nTo visualize this solution, we consider the Cartesian plane with both the parabola and the line plotted.\n\n- The parabola \\( y = x^2 \\) is a U-shaped curve that opens upwards with its vertex at the origin (0,0). As \\( x \\) increases or decreases, \\( y \\) increases quadratically.\n  \n- The line \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) is a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept at (0, 3). This line ascends steeply from left to right.\n\nThe intersection points can be described as follows:\n- The point \\( (3, 9) \\) is where the line intersects the parabola on the right side. If you move 3 units to the right from the origin along the x-axis, the y-coordinate at this point on the parabola is 9.\n- The point \\( (-1, 1) \\) is where the line intersects the parabola on the left side. If you move 1 unit to the left from the origin along the x-axis, the y-coordinate at this point on the parabola is 1.\n\nIn summary, the visual representation would show:\n- A parabolic curve opening upwards intersecting with a straight line that rises from left to right.\n- Two distinct intersection points: one at (3, 9) and the other at (-1, 1), where both the equations of the line and the parabola hold true.",
            "1. Solution to the problem:\n\nTo find the intersection points of the parabola \\( y = x^2 \\) and the line \\( y = 2x + 3 \\), we set the two equations equal to each other:\n\n\\[ x^2 = 2x + 3 \\]\n\nRearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, factor the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ x - 3 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 3 \\]\n\\[ x + 1 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -1 \\]\n\nNext, substitute these \\( x \\)-values back into either original equation to find the corresponding \\( y \\)-values. Using \\( y = 2x + 3 \\):\n\nFor \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 2(3) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, one intersection point is \\( (3, 9) \\).\n\nFor \\( x = -1 \\):\n\n\\[ y = 2(-1) + 3 = -2 + 3 = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the other intersection point is \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n\nTherefore, the intersection points are \\( (3, 9) \\) and \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n\n2. Visual description of the solution:\n\nTo visualize the solution, we can graph the parabola and the line on the Cartesian plane.\n\n- The parabola \\( y = x^2 \\) opens upwards and has its vertex at the origin (0, 0).

As x moves away from the origin, the y-values increase quadratically (more rapidly than the line).\n  \n- The line \\( y = 2x + 3 \\) is a straight line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept at (0, 3). This means the line rises twice as fast as it moves horizontally.\n\nThe intersection points found are (3, 9) and (-1, 1):\n\n- At \\( (3, 9) \\), both the parabola and the line share the same point where x = 3 and y = 9.\n- At \\( (-1, 1) \\), both the parabola and the line share the same point where x = -1 and y = 1.\n\nOn the graph, you will see the parabola starting from the origin and curving upwards.
