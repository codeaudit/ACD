            "content": "Given the task family description and the implementation details, here's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Logical Reasoning and Formal Logic**: Logical proof construction requires a deep understanding of logical reasoning and formal logic. This involves correctly applying logical rules and constructing a chain of reasoning that is both valid (follows logically from the premises) and sound (the premises are true and the conclusion follows). This is a challenging task, even for humans, especially those not well-versed in formal logic.\n\n2. **LLM Capabilities**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in natural language understanding, pattern recognition, and some degree of logical reasoning. However, constructing a formal logical proof from premises to a conclusion involves a higher level of abstract reasoning and meticulous step-by-step thinking, which is often a weakness of current LLMs. They tend to excel at more intuitive or pattern-based reasoning rather than strict formal logic.\n\n3. **Human Difficulty**: The task is estimated to be very difficult for humans, implying it requires specialized knowledge and skills. If an LLM can succeed in such a task, it would be quite impressive.\n\n4. **Evaluation Method**: The evaluation method uses `eval_with_llm_judge`, which means the LLM's output is judged by another LLM. This can introduce some uncertainty, as LLMs might not be perfectly reliable in evaluating formal logical correctness. However, assuming the LLM judge is sufficiently robust, it should be able to identify valid and sound logical proofs.\n\nConsidering these points, the success of the LLM in constructing a logical proof in this context is noteworthy. It demonstrates a higher level of logical reasoning capability than typically expected from current LLMs.\n\nDecision: Yes"
