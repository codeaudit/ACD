            "1. **Circuit Diagram (described in text format):**\n\nThe circuit consists of a 12V battery connected in parallel to three resistors. The resistors have values of 4 ohms, 6 ohms, and 12 ohms, respectively. Each resistor is connected directly across the battery terminals.\n\n2. **Calculations:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total resistance (R_total) of the parallel circuit.**\n\nUsing the formula for total resistance in a parallel circuit:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\\[ R_1 = 4 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\\[ R_2 = 6 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\\[ R_3 = 12 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{12} \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.0833 \\]\n\nSum the terms:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = 0.25 + 0.1667 + 0.0833 \\approx 0.5 \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the current through each branch using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).**\n\nGiven voltage (V) is 12V for all resistors since they are in parallel.\n\n\\[ I_1 = \\frac{V}{R_1} = \\frac{12V}{4 \\, \\Omega} = 3A \\]\n\\[ I_2 = \\frac{V}{R_2} = \\frac{12V}{6 \\, \\Omega} = 2A \\]\n\\[ I_3 = \\frac{V}{R_3} = \\frac{12V}{12 \\, \\Omega} = 1A \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the voltage across each resistor.**\n\nIn a parallel circuit, the voltage across each resistor is equal to the source voltage.\n\n\\[ V_1 = V = 12V \\]\n\\[ V_2 = V = 12V \\]\n\\[ V_3 = V = 12V \\]\n\n3. **Final Values:**\n\n- Total Resistance (R_total): 2 ohms\n- Current through each branch:\n  - I_1 (through 4 ohms resistor): 3A\n  - I_2 (through 6 ohms resistor): 2A\n  - I_3 (through 12 ohms resistor): 1A\n- Voltage across each resistor:\n  - V_1 (across 4 ohms resistor): 12V\n  - V_2 (across 6 ohms resistor): 12V\n  - V_3 (across 12 ohms resistor): 12V\n\nAnswer: Total Resistance: 2 ohms, Current through each branch: 3A (4 ohms), 2A (6 ohms), 1A (12 ohms), Voltage across each resistor: 12V (4 ohms), 12V (6 ohms), 12V (12 ohms)"

This approach could be suitable if the evaluation criteria are well-defined and the LLM judge is reliable.\n- **Task Code Implementation**: The provided code appears to correctly specify the tasks and instructions, with a clear structure and relevant parameters.\n\n**LLM Capabilities**:\n- LLMs are generally good at following structured instructions and performing basic calculations if the principles are well-documented.\n- However, complex technical reasoning, especially in a domain-specific context like electrical engineering, can be challenging for LLMs.\n\n**Decision Reasoning**:\n- Given the task's difficulty and the requirement for precise technical knowledge and problem-solving skills, it would be reasonable to expect that an LLM might struggle with such tasks.\n- If the LLM agent succeeds, it indicates a significant capability in understanding and applying complex domain-specific knowledge, which would be noteworthy.\n\nDecision: Yes"
