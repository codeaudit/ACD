Colorful stalls lined the streets, selling everything from handcrafted jewelry to aromatic spices. The air was filled with the tantalizing aroma of samosas, jalebis, and other delectable treats being prepared by local vendors.\n\nChildren ran around excitedly, their faces painted with intricate designs, while elders sat under the shade of large banyan trees, sharing stories and laughter. The highlight of the festival was the traditional dance performance, where men and women dressed in bright, elaborate costumes danced to the rhythmic beats of drums and the melodic tunes of flutes.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the village was illuminated by the soft glow of lanterns, and the sounds of laughter and music filled the air.
