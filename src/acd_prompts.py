    + """We especially want you to uncover tasks that could reveal surprising capabilities or failures.
Successfully written task families will be added to a task archive.
In each generation, previously generated task families will be provided as context so that you can generate different tasks.
Be creative, explore different domains, and design tasks that can distinguish between models with varying levels of expertise.
Make sure each task is coherent and does not try to combine too many concepts into one.

Each task family should be designed according to the METR Standard, which requires the following Python format:

```python
class TaskFamily:
    @staticmethod
    def get_tasks() -> dict[str, dict]:
        # Returns a mapping from task names to arbitrary data that is specific to each task.
        # Each task family should contain 2 tasks in the dictionary, labelled "1" and "2".
        # ... implementation ...

    @staticmethod
    def get_instructions(t: dict) -> str:
        # This method should return a string containing initial task instructions for the agent.
        # ... implementation ...

    @staticmethod
    def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:
        # `score` is called after the agent submits a solution. Return 0 on failure and 1 on success. Do not give partial scores.
        # Throwing an exception will result in a score of 0.
        # ... implementation ...
```

The `score` function may optionally call a helper function that calls a GPT-4 based LLM judge.
```python
# Automated LLM judge helper function
def eval_with_llm_judge(
        instructions: str,  # The instructions for the task
        submission: str,  # The submission to evaluate
        criteria: Optional[List[str]] = None,  # Optional additional criteria to evaluate the submission against
) -> bool:
    # Returns a boolean indicating whether the agent is deemed to have succeeded at the task, and meets any additional criteria.
```

You should use this function unless the task is better evaluated through code.
DO NOT RE-IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTION!
There is no need to repeat any criteria that are already in the instructions.
One possible use of the criteria field is if you already have an answer in mind for the task.
An example usage in `score` with an optional criteria is as follows:
```python
@staticmethod
def score(t: dict, submission: str) -> float | None:
    from src.eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge
    instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)
    criteria = ["The response should include the name Alice."]
    return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0
```

Respond precisely in the following format including the JSON start and end markers:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

RESPONSE JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly think and reason about what kind of task family you want to propose. Thoughts may also include (but are not limited to): your motivation for investigating the capability, whether you think the model will succeed or fail at this, its novelty relative to what you have already generated, how to ensure the tasks are valid, whether or it is suitable to invoke an LLM judge for scoring.

In <JSON>, provide a JSON response with the following fields:
- "name_of_task": A concise, descriptive label (lowercase, no spaces, e.g., "name_capital_city").
- "description_of_task": A clear explanation of what the task entails. (e.g., "Return the capital city of a country").
- "capability_being_measured": The specific LLM capability being evaluated (e.g., knowledge, reasoning, creativity, ...).
- "estimated_human_difficulty": An estimate of the difficulty of the task on a 1-5 scale. 1 = very easy (simple factual recall), 2 = easy (basic understanding, some inference), 3 = moderate (application of knowledge, multiple steps), 4 = difficult (analysis, synthesis, creative problem-solving), 5 = very difficult (highly specialized knowledge, complex reasoning).
- "done": By default, this is set to "False". You will have {num_rounds} rounds to refine the task family but do not need to use them all. Tasks will only be saved if they are flagged "done" by the end. Do not return "True" until you are satisfied with and have received feedback on the task family.
- "task_family": The fully implemented Python code for the TaskFamily class. Write good human-readable code.

All values in the JSON should be strings.
You may only use standard Python packages and libraries to implement the tasks.
Required library imports should be included either at the top of the file or in the class method where they are used. An import at the start of the class has no effect.
DO NOT download additional data from the internet, or access the file system.
Your response will be automatically parsed and used for evaluation, so ensure all components MUST be fully implemented and adhere to the METR standard."""

In your thoughts, first carefully consider the correctness of the task family you just created. Factors may include but are not limited to:
- Whether sufficient synthetic data has been given in the instructions to challenge the models.
- Incomplete class definitions, syntax errors, misplaced import statements.
- Feasibility of the evaluation criteria.
- Any ambiguity or issues in the clarity of the tasks.
- The consistency and accuracy of all the fields in the JSON.
- Whether precisely two entries in `get_tasks` have been defined.
- Whether agents can get a successful score in an unintended manner.
- Whether the desired response format for the agent has been given in the instructions.
- Under no circumstances should the instructions contain the answer or any direct hints leading to the answer. Ensure that the task remains challenging without giving away the solution.
- If the agent fails at the task, it is OK as long as the task is valid and the agent's failure is due to the difficulty of the task. You are also trying to find surprising failures!

Do not set the "done" flag to "True" on the final step if there are major issues with the task family.'''
